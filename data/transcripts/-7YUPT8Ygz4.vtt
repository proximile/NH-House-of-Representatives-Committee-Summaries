to check uh senators representa is
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone here from that you guys are
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
expecting hey
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
Mike it was it is representative Wilder
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
were we expecting anybody else from the
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
house okay or in Senator gray I don't
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
think anyone else from the Senate was
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
coming okay just wanted double check and
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
be kind of be respectful make sure
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
everyone was here well it is great to
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
see everybody here and obviously a big
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
welcome uh to uh governor elect a um
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
very excited in terms of working with
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
her and her transition as everything
 
00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
moves forward um one thing I will will
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
say just about the transition process I
 
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
know we're here to talk about the budget
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
is we're very lucky in New Hampshire in
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
that um every transition always goes
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
very smoothly I think this one will go
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
exceptionally smoothly but the fact that
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you know this Governor Le doesn't as
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
did I didn't have to come in and rehire
 
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of new agency heads and
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
restart the whole process um it really
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
is an amazing advantage to keep the uh
 
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
operations of the state moving smoothly
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
to having opportunities like this where
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
our current agency heads are coming in
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
and talking about a budget process that
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of which maybe all of
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
which uh will continue on through
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process as well
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
and that continuity I think gives New
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire always an upper hand over a
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
lot of other states uh especially as it
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to moments of
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
transition our teams are the same the
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
folks on the ground are the same whether
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Mental Health
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
Services or DCF or whatever the needs
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
may be um those needs are constantly
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
being met regardless of of what might be
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
happening up here in conquer and uh it
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
really is a smooth process and and well
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
underway I I I was there eight years ago
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
I I know I know the uh Governor Le dead
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
is being absolutely overwhelmed um but
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's great um and a big thanks to the
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
folks over at safety where all the a lot
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
of these issues of transition are
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
happening they've provided a great
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
resource uh for her team so as uh as we
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
all know the state budget process it
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
really is the most important uh we can
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
say document but really process uh that
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
comes before the state every two years
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
and it isn't just in what is on the
 
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 align:start position:0%
final piece of paper it's the
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about not just the
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
individual agencies what's happening on
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
the ground the public testimony which so
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
many folks across our state uh
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the subcommittees the
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
house process the Senate process um it
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
has its checks and balances but that's
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
all really driven to transparency and
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that we talk about what's
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
what's happening out there uh where we
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
can push where we can pull where some
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
programs might be Antiquated uh and we
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
can always challenge our self and strive
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
to do better um uh I was reminded this
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
morning you we've obviously come a long
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
way since 2016 it's eight years ago but
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
it's more than that it's we as a lot of
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
us call it pre-pandemic um the whole
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
world is very different in terms of how
 
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.589 align:start position:0%
world is very different in terms of how
we

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
operate um what the priorities are uh
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
some of the efficiencies we found some
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
of the um uh Capital uh Investments
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
we've been able to make not just with
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
the federal funds coming in with arpa
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
with our capital budget process those
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
have been uh very fortuitous for the
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but they all they
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
all complement what we do on the
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
operational side as well um I've always
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
said that if if we have a progrowth pro
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
bus model uh that drives the success in
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
terms of the opportunities that the
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
government will have government
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for its that it can create
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
for its citizen is all driven on having
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
a successful business successful growth
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
models uh and we've been able to do that
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
especially uh standing out from the
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
crowd here in the Northeast we've been
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
very successful we
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know pre pandemic eight years ago
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
we had deficits in the education trust
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
fund today we have over $200 million
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
surplus uh we have we had 5060 million
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
whatever it was in the rainy day fund
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
today we have nearly $250 million
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
sitting in the r rainy day fund now
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
those aren't funds to be dipped into for
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
General and obligation you know
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
long-term obligations uh they're really
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
there for a rainy day there's a a reason
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
we call it a rainy day fund and uh over
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
the years I think the legisl has been
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
very cognizant very responsible about
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
that you know the other the other piece
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'll throw out there the kind of good
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
news piece more on the capital and
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
one-time spending side is we've been I
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
think very successful successful in um
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh drawing down our debt I think we have
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 Monica maybe at the State
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
Treasury I'm doing these numbers off the
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
top of my head but we have about 30%
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
less debt than we did just eight years
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
ago in terms of the overall debt load of
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the state that gives us and our credit
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
rating actually went up of all things we
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't had that in over 40 years so um
 
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
econ ically we are seen as strong we
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
have a great credit rating we can borrow
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
at low rates if we have to so we have
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
this back stop uh in case of emergencies
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
if we need to or for larger Capital
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
Investments as the legislature may
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
choose coming down the road so um
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's opportunity there really is on
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
the operational side that's really what
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
these hearings are about where we bring
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
in all the different agency heads we'll
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
start with the Department of Revenue not
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
quite yet Lindsay good to see you um uh
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
we'll bring the Department of Revenue up
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
up first to talk more on the uh spending
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
side in terms of their Department
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
obviously the uh house Ways and Means
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the the Senate uh will will get
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
involved a little more on the revenue
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
side as well and uh as we get closer to
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
that um well as the governor elect gets
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
closer to that February budget address
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
um we I I have no doubt the agencies
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
will be providing a lot of information
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
on where these Revenue projections are
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
we've been very fortunate in the past uh
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
not just the past eight years but
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
specifically this past year we had about
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
$125 million surplus uh over the first
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
year of this bium I think we've been
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
about even um uh you know since then
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
which is great so we're still sitting in
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
this current budget with a with a very
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
healthy Surplus um but uh the realities
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
of inflation the realities of the cost
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
of living as much as they're hitting all
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
these uh all of our families and
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state it hits
 
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
government too we've had pay had to
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
increase pay here to maintain and um you
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
know and rightly so to maintain our our
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
employee base our staffing base uh so
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
those labor costs have gone up as
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
they've gone up everywhere else and so
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
obviously something to be built into the
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
next budget process uh we've always been
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
able to cut taxes we've always been able
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
to have surpluses uh it doesn't happen
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
just with math on the paper it happens
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
really at the at the heart of it with
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
good management I think the legislature
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
I'll also say we'll see where it goes
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
this year but you know I think we've
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
established a very good lapse process
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
here making sure that there are lapses
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
built into the budget that there's a
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
cushion in there if you will um in that
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
process looking at vacancies how we
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
treat vacancies in the state is a whole
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
different ball game now uh given that we
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
have had a very high
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in certain areas um how the
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
budget is determined in certain um
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
agencies uh sometimes I I can tell you
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little Antiquated um they're
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
looking at census counts in certain
 
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
areas or or demands on an agency in
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
certain areas that maybe were made sense
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic but post pandemic there's
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
all these uh additional opportunities
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
the onetime spending that has come in
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
from the federal government has been um
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
again a very fortuitous for the state
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the um it's it's created a lot of
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'll I'll I'll say I think
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
our teams and and I think Charles
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
deserves and his team deserve a lot of
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
credit um in the legislature especially
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
I think we've done a phenomenal job uh
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
spending that money very responsibly on
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
one-time spending that's a very
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
important point because we have not
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
created long-term obligations within our
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
agencies that now have to be covered
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
with our our business taxes or or our
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
other General Revenue taxes other states
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
have I think fallen into that trap I
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
think we we've really minimized it as
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
those funds have come in over the past 3
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
4 years there's also been a lot of
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
programs that have been created on a
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
temporary basis right for a uh temporary
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh an infrastructure program coming in
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
um a development program coming in with
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
arpa money sometimes we say okay we're
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
going to create uh positions but they're
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
only going to be a couple years to
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
manage those funds to manage those
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities that come and you know as
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
a lot as as always been anticipated a
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
lot of those positions will go away
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's just that's the way it was
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
designed um as that that onetime money
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
comes in we're kind of heading towards
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
the back end of that all the oper
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
dollars have now been allocated
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
um and uh as we kind kind of come
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
through that we hit more of a of an
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
auditing phase uh through through those
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and we can reduce the number uh
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
or take you know pull some of those what
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
are now vacancies out of the budget so
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunity there to
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
constantly manage making sure that the
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to the programs we
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
need through the agency phase that
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
started a few months ago I went to all
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
the different agencies and we gave them
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
individual targets now they all amounted
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
to about about a four if you added all
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers up it came out to maybe
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
about a 4% reduction but we tried to be
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
very specific uh with the different
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
agencies in terms of the targets that we
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
were setting up um I'd remind folks that
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
we've had you know double digit growth
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and and increases in uh the our ability
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
to increase in spending here over the
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
last eight years so you know asking
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
these agencies to look at again those
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
additional dollars that may have been
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
spent as part of managing the arpa money
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh as well as looking at their actual
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
vacancies uh you know creating those um
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities for those
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
positions uh that have to be filled
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
based on today's needs um and in doing
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
that there's no reason um that we didn't
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
think that they could uh reduce it by
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
about approximately 4% if you looked at
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
over the overall numbers the good news
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
is they all came back uh with very
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
minimal disruption sometimes absolutely
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
no disruption in any of the current
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
programming uh across the state so I I
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
my that's my long way of saying my hats
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
off to all the agency heads I think for
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
for kind of digging in looking at their
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
numbers challenging themselves um again
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
on that management side of things and in
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know I think if there's ever a
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
mission that we have set out here it
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
really is to uh Empower our agency heads
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
to be the best managers that they can be
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and overall I think they've they've
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
done just a real phenomenal job with
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
that so now we'll kind of get into that
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
actual budget process looking at exactly
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
what the needs are this is really one of
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
the uh initial steps of it where we kind
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
of hear firsthand from all the agency
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
heads in terms of of of their uh needs
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
what is a necessity versus a want um you
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
know that's always kind of the um that's
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
where the rubber meets the road um and
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
again obviously the the governor will
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
present her budget uh in early February
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature will have at it I'm sure
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
they'll just maybe they'll just agree
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and just uh just sign it next day that
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
great no Senator Grace smiling maybe
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility um governor
 
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.150 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility um governor
governor

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
Lea I did cut several million dollars
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
out of the last budget that I got in the
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
Senate so well several million is
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
manageable when you're dealing with a
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
few billion um okay and and again just
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
as a reminder also talking about General
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
funds we're talking about the federal
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
dollars that come in as well um kind
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
really on both sides I mean there's
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
really two sides of the same Ledger uh
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
that really have to be have to be
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
accounted for here um am I missing
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
anything James no that's it
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie no
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we'll ask um um
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner step to come on up and
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
present the agency phase of the budget
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
and requests for the Department of
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%

state for another two fiscal years in a
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
manner that's consistent with this
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
Mission as the primary revenue
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
collection agency we are aware of the
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
current Revenue Trends and have worked
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
hard to produce a budget that's
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with the targets
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
provided in fiscal year 20124 the Dr
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
collected 2.9 billion in state revenue
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
with total expenses of less than 22.7
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
million some of those expenses are for
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
activities unrelated to revenue
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
collection such as local assessment
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
reviews and state aid when those
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated costs are accounted for our
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
cost for collection is just over 1 half
 
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.470 align:start position:0%
cost for collection is just over 1 half
of

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
1% the slides included with this
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
testimony explain how we're able to
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
build a banal budget that continues to
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
be an unparalleled return on state tax
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
dollar investment we look forward to
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
working with the governor and the
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
legislature as you build the next
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
flipping to slide three of the
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
presentation this just provides a
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
overview of the
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
Dr on page four you'll
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
see the FY 2627 agency budget kind of at
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
a very high level so you have fiscal
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
year 25 adjusted authorized fiscal year
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
26 are efficiency request and fiscal
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
year 27 efficiency request you'll see
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
that our budget is approximately 85%
 
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.390 align:start position:0%
that our budget is approximately 85%
General

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
funds from the education trust fund we
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
pay out the low and moderate um property
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
tax relief from that um
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
fund and the agency income is a
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
combination of flood control payments
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
which we make to municipalities based on
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
flood compacts with Connecticut and
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and also Debt Service on
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
our Revenue information management
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
system also known as
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
rims both years are consistent with the
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
targets that you provided Governor
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 was adjusted for rent and
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund increases and fiscal
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
year 27 was adjusted for the same as
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
well as salary and benefit increases for
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
positions that were funded in fiscal
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
year 26 again this was consistent with
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
the information provided from the
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
services at the bottom you'll see our
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
position counts um for fiscal year 25
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
and then our efficiency requests for
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
27 providing some more detail on page
 
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
27 providing some more detail on page
five

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
our current funded position count is
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
reduced by 18 positions in the
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget so we're reducing our
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
full-time positions to 135 classified
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
and unclassified and five part-time
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
positions uh the positions that we are
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
UNF funding include nine tax Auditors
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
five tax examiners two administrators
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
one pargal and one utility appraiser all
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the positions that we propos to
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
unfund or currently
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
vacant our general fund operating budget
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
is 70% salaries and benefits so we are a
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
department of people not programs or
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
things so when it comes time to make
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
decisions it usually comes down to
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
positions our budget requests fully
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
operationalize the Department's Revenue
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
information management system known as
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
rims Capital expenses um for that
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
project will end on
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
12312 uh the department received
 
00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:59.549 align:start position:0%
12312 uh the department received
received

00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
$3,160 th000 Capital appropriation to
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
modernize our system and create rims and
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
those Capital funds are ending so we
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
have converted all of those ongoing
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
costs now into our operating
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
budget the operating budget will also
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
fund a conversion of rims to a
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
cloud-based platform so we are currently
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
using Hardware on premise Hardware that
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
is over at 27 Hazen and we will be
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
converting or we would like to convert
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
to a cloud-based platform going forward
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
forward the budget also includes funding
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
for additional rims support audit
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
positions and assistance in the hearing
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
Bureau hearings Bureau we included as
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs other reductions
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
include out ofate travel training and
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and the budget um office the
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
division directors and our other
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
managers worked really hard to build a
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
budget that was conservative and
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
accurate and we request funds for needs
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
and not wants we really went line by
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
line division by division and made sure
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
needed on page six this is the first of
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's prioritized needs I'll
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
mention though that the dr's efficiency
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
of budget as submitted maintains all
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
current operations but there are a few
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
places where the Dr has requested um
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
additional funding in the area of
 
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.789 align:start position:0%
additional funding in the area of
prioritized

00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
needs the first is for additional Rim
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
support we would ask to restore funding
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
for one full-time equivalent vendor
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
consultant from our fast Enterprises
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
vendor and one Dr administrator who
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
would serve as our project
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
manager we currently have six um fast
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
Consultants we call them fases um housed
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
at Dr currently the budget the
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget funds four consultants
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so this is a request for one more at
 
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.070 align:start position:0%
and so this is a request for one more at
five

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
on page seven we also have a prioritized
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
need to restore funding for four
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
positions in the audit division and
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
funding for the associated out of-state
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
travel these would be two instate
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
Auditors one multi- entity auditor and
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
one multi-state auditor and then the out
 
00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
of state travel would support the travel
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau on page eight our last um Dr
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
specific prioritized need is to restore
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
funding for a paralal in the hearings
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau um we recently implemented an
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
easier way for taxpayers to appeal any
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
tax notices that they receive they can
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
now do that electronically it's much
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
more convenient for them but it's likely
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
going to increase in the number of
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
appeals that we receive and so this
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
position would help support the increase
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
in appeals while still maintaining an
 
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.029 align:start position:0%
in appeals while still maintaining an
efficient

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
process the last two prioritized needs
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
um one was from the Department of
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and the other was
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department of administrative
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
six on page nine just some updates about
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing for the past two
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
years with our or past year and a few
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
months with our current operating
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
budget with respect to rims we upgraded
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the latest version which is called
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
core 21 and that went live just last
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
month in
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
October that was paid for by arpa money
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
um those are really one-time funds uh
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
our maintenance costs did not change um
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
the core 21 upgrade um enhanced security
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
through tokenization and authentication
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
it's a modern coding language we're told
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
that the new language will be um much
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
have much greater appeal to those that
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
are recently graduating from four-year
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
um computer science programs and it also
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
increased the efficiency and ease of use
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers tax practitioners and our
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
staff as well
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
well also relative to rims as part of
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
the funding for the rims project there
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
was a large portion that was paid by
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
capital and then there's a portion that
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
the state will pay back through
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue uplift and so we
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
track the amount of Revenue uplift that
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
rims has generated so this is money that
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
we did not receive or would not have
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
been able to receive in our prior
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
software but with the upgrade we've seen
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
um additional
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue so revenue revenue uplift for um
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
existing taxes attributable to the imple
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
implementation of rims reached 14 and a
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
half million in fiscal year 24 and we
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
are at 31.1 million of additional
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue to date since the system was
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
fully implemented in August of 2021 so
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
just about three years after
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
implementation we've generated $31
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
million we do that in a variety of ways
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 we sent out reminder
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
to pay letters so it's very simple we
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
sent out a tax notice and in our old
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
system we would just hope you would pay
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't pay then you'd be
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
converted into a collections case now 30
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
days after we send that first notice the
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
system automatically sends a reminder
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
that generated $5.4 Million last year
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
very simple automated taxpayers
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because everyone's busy
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
they lose sight of it they get a nice
 
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.230 align:start position:0%
they lose sight of it they get a nice
reminder

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
reminder
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
um the system also allows us to use
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
federal tax information so that's
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
information provided to us by the IRS to
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that state and federal filings
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
are consistent with the increased
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
security of rims that we didn't have in
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
our prior system we have greater ability
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
to use this information that generated
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
$7.1 Million last year and then we now
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
have a feature through the system that
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
allows taxpayers to sign up for
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
automated payment plans if your payment
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
plan is simple and it falls within
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
specifications that we've identified you
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
can go on to the portal you can sign up
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
for yourself with very little or no
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
interaction from the Dr and that
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
million the way the statute reads we can
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
transfer up to $4 million per fiscal
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
year into the Rim's Debt Service account
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
and so we obviously exceeded that amount
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
this year so the full 4 million was
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
transferred into the general fund and
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
then we'll pay the um the supporting
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
Debt Service
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
other other budget priorities for the
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
current budget fleet vehicles we have
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
upgraded our fleet vehicles we have all
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
wheeel drive hybrid vehicles to help
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that our appraisers and our
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
collectors can perform their work out on
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
the road and the hybrids cut down on gas
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
forward and lastly on page 10 we made
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
some additional technology upgrades with
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
arpa funds I mentioned the enhancement
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the rim system to core 21 we also um
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
purchased a new high-speed scanner that
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
allows us to Pro process paper forms and
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
checks um that increased throughput
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
speed is anywhere between 10 to 66%
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
depending on the settings um
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
automatically separates documents so
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
that requires less upfront work of our
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
staff and reduced manual data entry as
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
the camera and resolution of the of the
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
system is much better and so it's able
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
to read the information more
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
clearly we we also upgraded our
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
Equalization web application this has
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
expanded functionality to include dr's
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal assessment review and
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
revaluation monitoring and also a
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
modernized platform for our Equalization
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
ratio studies which includes mobile
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
ability for our folks out in the
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
field lastly I just want to take a
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
moment to highlight the fact that
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
customer service remains a priority of
 
00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
customer service remains a priority of
the

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
Dr in fiscal year 24 and fiscal year 25
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
to date we have maintained a rating of
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
three or higher on a a scale of 1 to
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
five from 99% of our customer
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
satisfaction surveys and those are
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
surveys that callers that call into our
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
call center receive at the end of their
 
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.310 align:start position:0%
call center receive at the end of their
phone

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
call also for customer service the
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
initial launch and subsequent upgrade of
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
Rim's online portal Grant at tax connect
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
continues to focus the needs on the
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
needs of taxpayers and practitioners to
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
date we have received over 48,000
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
external users so that's pretty
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
remarkable and the core 21 upgrade now

questions great thank you terrific job
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
as usual um I guess we can see if anyone
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I I have a a question um
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you um I'm going to
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
start off with by giving you a a a
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
compliment and that is that uh the the
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
rims project is is widely regarded I
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
believe as one of the state's uh most
 
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
successful IT projects over the years
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
and as part of that you've had uh
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
employees from Fast Enterprises embedded
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
in your team uh they are productive but
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
they are not cheap correct uh can you uh
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
just talk a little bit about the return
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
you get on that investment and is there
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
a less costly way for that to do this
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
the same input that they would provide
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
you that's a great question so one thing
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
that fast Enterprises does differently I
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
think than some of the other software
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
vendors is James as you mentioned the
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
staff is embedded here they move to New
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they live here with their
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
families they don't fly in on a Monday
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
morning and fly out on a Friday
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon they sit in the department we
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
treat them like our own um they come to
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
our department-wide meetings they are on
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
all of my email Communications unless
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's something about you know submitting
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
a time card um we treat them as if
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're our own um their cost as you can
 
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:07.599 align:start position:0%
see from the prioritized
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
need is roughly
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
$450,000 a year for a full-time
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent um however rims is has been
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
very productive it produces significant
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift and we have really tried
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
to figure out the right balance between
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
utilizing the fast
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
consultants and also utilizing our own
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
staff so fast has the opportunity for
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
you to just sign on for blanket
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance and support and you pay a
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
flat fee and you get what you get we
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
have opted to do time and materials so
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can very much control the amount of
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
support that we need we can ramp it up
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
or ramp it down within the budget so
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
that we're getting exactly what we need
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
but we're also utilizing our embedded
 
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.310 align:start position:0%
but we're also utilizing our embedded
DOI

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
DOI
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
staff in our last operating budget we
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
received funding for two additional
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
developers so that we could make sure
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
that we are developing rims alongside
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
the Consultants so you heard me say
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
we're currently at approximately six
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
Consultants the efficiency budget funds
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
four I think we can do it with four I'd
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
feel a little bit more comfortable with
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
five which is why we included the one
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
prioritize need but this was something
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
Governor that we discussed after the
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
last budget which was kind of SC maing
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
back the Consultants but finding the
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
right balance and I think we're almost
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
there um and I'm confident that that
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
done hi hi um I have a couple of
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
questions one is on the on the uplift on
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue um you transfer 4 million a year
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
when is that expire is it 20 years so we
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
will transfer $4 million a year until we
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
hit $40 million so if it if we were
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
guessing that means 10
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
years that was a joke well kind of um it
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
would it would be 10 years however the
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
first year we did not transfer the full
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
$4 million because rims was had only
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
been operational for a few months um so
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
so the first year would have been what
 
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.309 align:start position:0%
so the first year would have been what
fiscal

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
18 the or 19 first year was is sorry no
 
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.990 align:start position:0%
18 the or 19 first year was is sorry no
that's

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
fine the first year was fiscal
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
21 oh because we went live oh yeah yeah
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
yeah in
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
81921 um
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we will do this for a little
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
over seven years remaining I had okay so
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
these next two budget years and then
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
some then thereafter if we continue to
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
prod prod $4 million a year which I have
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
we produce $14 million this year so I
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
have no reason to believe that the
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
amount would fall below the $4 million a
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
year and that's just a direct hit to the
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
general fund correct we do it by tax
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
type so we identify the amount of
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we a revenue uplift from
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes from interest and
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
dividends tax from meals and rentals tax
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
those are the three taxes at this point
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
and because we are over the $4 million
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
we PR rate it and transfer up to 4
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
million based on those tax types so to
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
date we have deposited 14.17 million so
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
2.83 million to go so $4 million a year
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
we will do do deposits for seven more
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
years cool okay
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
um you have a you have a very easy to
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
understand budget I don't want anyone to
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
get misled about future agencies from
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um the uh but I had one question
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
question about um you know for the most
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
part your everything on your list is um
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
understandable your transfers to
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
doit um go up more than a million this
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
year but they're also 3 million more
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
than 24 they go from 3.4 in 24 to
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
6.5 in 26 which is did something happen
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
that is as we have operationalized the
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
cost of rims so the capital budget is
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
ending and we've needed to shift the
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
support and ongoing support and
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance for rims into the operating
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
budget so that's what you're seeing
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
there um and
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
in this F in this budget fiscal year 26
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.750 align:start position:0%
in this F in this budget fiscal year 26
and

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
27 we are going to move into the
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
operating budget about $800,000 of
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
software maintenance a year and about
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
$750,000 um of cloud maintenance as we
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
transition to the cloud
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
Cloud so those and those were capex
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
before those were capex before okay and
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
so we essentially achieved The increased
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
cost there by reducing our position
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
count that was that was the balance we
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
needed to make so that we would still
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
meet the Target and we do still meet the
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
target okay that was it all right I'll
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
now okay great well thank you guys
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%

panel it's good to be with you this

morning to present the budget for the
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice for fiscal year
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
2627 joining me this morning to my right
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
is Kathy Carr our director of
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
administration and to Cathy's right is
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
Tom Kemper our deputy director of
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
administration we were able to lure Tom
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
back to the office um to help help us
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
primarily at least right now with the
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
operations of the YDC settlement fund
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
which you'll see um from our budget not
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about that today but
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
from our budget the dollars flowing
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
through that settlement fund are bigger
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
than than our budget so we needed some
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
additional help to to manage those
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
dollars um I always like to start off
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
our presentation by talking a little bit
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
about the the various roles of of the
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
Attorney General and I of course know
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
the governor-elect is very familiar with
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
this the attorney general is is the
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
chief law enforcement officer so
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
provides supervision and Leadership to
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement throughout the state the
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is the chief prosecutor
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
so we prosecute many cases in the office
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
we also supervise all criminal
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutions around the state the
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is the chief legal
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
officer so we defend the state when the
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
state gets sued and we provide legal
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
councel to every branch of state
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
government it's always interesting for
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
people to learn that we actually are the
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers for the judicial branch when
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
they're sued for for administrative
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
things so the the legal role the role of
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
the chief legal officer in the Attorney
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
General's office is a broad one and then
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has just broad
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
common law powers to to protect the
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
public and of course the attorney
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
general has to serve as the head of of
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
an agency the Department of Justice so
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General serves various
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
roles and the Department of Justice is
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
the office that helps the Attorney
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
General carry out that mission which
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
again is is a broad one but I think we
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
all agree an important one we have 1995
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
total authorized permanent positions so
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for any additional
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
positions in the coming budget and we'll
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
go through um those
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
details the next page of of the
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
slideshow here is just an organizational
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
chart for the office so this is a this
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
gives you a picture of the operations of
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
the office
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
um generally the office is broken down
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
into two major functions civil and
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
criminal so there's the division of
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
public protection which generally is
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
either the criminal or the enforcement
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
side of the office that division
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
contains the criminal justice Bureau the
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau and the
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau and then
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have the division of legal councel
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
which is with a couple exceptions
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
generally the Civil side of the office
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
so that is where we do civil litigation
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's where we do client counseling we
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
provide legal counsel to all of the
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
state agencies that division contains
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
the public safety and infrastructure
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau which basically just does civil
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
litigation and client counseling for the
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and the Department
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and that division also
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
contains the charitable trust unit the
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
election law unit and the Civil Rights
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
unit so there's a little criminal work
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
that goes on in the division of legal
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
council because the election law unit of
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
course does do criminal work when it
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutes voter fraud cases the Civil
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
Rights unit at times might do a little
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
bit of criminal work but generally the
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
office is broken down into public
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
protection which is mostly criminal and
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and legal counsel which is
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
mostly civil the office also contains
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
the chief medical examiner so the chief
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
medical examiner is part of the the
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice so that that is
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is a part of the Department of
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
Justice which is outside of those two
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
divisions and then the director
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
Administration oversees sort of the
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
administrative parts of the office the
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
business office victims compensation it
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and um the Train the
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
training operations of of the office one
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
thing that is new in the office the last
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
few years is the solicitor general so
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
the office has always done a lot of
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
appet work it's had a chief of Criminal
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
Appeals in the past but in 2018 the
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
office established the position of
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
solicitor general to oversee both
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
criminal and Civil Appeals in the office
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
so this organizational chart provides
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
just a good kind of operational overview
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
office the next slide is really just how
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
the orc chart looks in the budget system
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a little bit redundant but
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
that at least gives you a sense of how
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
many positions exist in both the
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
division of public protection and the
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
division of legal council and then how
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
many positions exist within the chief
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
medical examiner's office and within the
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
division of Grants management so this I
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
like to say that this is more like the
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
how the the organizational chart looks
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
in the system it's not really the
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
operational organizational chart but at
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
least gives you a sense of where the
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
different positions are located we don't
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
break positions out by every single unit
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
and Bureau because it would get a little
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
unwieldy but certainly if there are
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions on that we can
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
breakdown moving into the Department's
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget request which is on
 
00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget request which is on
slide

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
six now this requires a little bit of
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
explanation because when you first look
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
at it it looks like we are are
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
operational costs are increasing which
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is not the case but I'm going to
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
go line by line here and explain
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
in general funds this is a little
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
confusing it looks like our general
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
funds are going up from fiscal year 25
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 26 but we had a an
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
interesting part of our budget in 24 uh
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
25 which is that for fiscal year 24 we
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
had $4.3 million appropriated for fiscal
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
year 24 but which did not lapse until
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal year 25 so the idea
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
was rather than appropriate $2 million
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
and 2 million or two you know roughly 2
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 24 and roughly 2
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
million for fiscal year 25 it was
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
appropriated in fiscal 24 and just in
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
lapse until fiscal year
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
25 because of that there is $2 million
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
that shows up as fiscal year
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
$24 in the system but it really is
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
should be under fiscal year 25 and so
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's why our Target was we did we've
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
met our targets here but that's why our
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
631755200 dollars were about 22.5
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
million and the math there works out if
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
you do the math a 4% reductions about
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
$900,000 so that that explains why the
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
general funds look like they do if you
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
go down to the next line the federal
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
funds our federal funds in our budget
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
are basically grants that we take in and
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
then sub Grant out so our federal funds
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
are going up not because we're spending
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
more federal funds on our operations but
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
because we anticipate getting this
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
amount of Federal grant dollars to
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
subgrant out um so it while the state
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
may be reducing its budget I think it is
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
generally not a surprise that some of
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the increased federal spending is still
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
rolling out in increased federal grants
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
and so our typical practice has been if
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
we anticipate getting federal grants in
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
we budget those grants in the budget and
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
we budget them to to subgrant out so
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is why it looks like federal funds
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
are going up they are but they're not
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
going up for operations they're going up
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
because we just anticipate having more
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
grant money to Grant out inter agency
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
funds is pretty consistent with with
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
what I think you would expect to see
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
because of the Target and then other
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds we have an increase there BEC and
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
the what's really driving that increase
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
are a couple of things mostly I think
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
fees associated with the operations of
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
the chief medical examiner so so adme
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
fees are not going up but we for for
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
instance for for cremations for for
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
viewing the body we charge a fee every
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
time we do that and we are seeing the
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of views go up and when views go
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
up travel costs for the admes go up
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
because the admes have to drive around
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
to different funeral homes to view these
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
bodies so this number is going up it's
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
not going up because of additional
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
people it's not going up because of you
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
know doing new things we haven't done
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
before it's going up because it's just
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
directly correlated to to the the number
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
of views we're doing in the office of
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
the chief medical examiner that that's
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
just one component of it but that's an
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
example of why that that number is going
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
up my understanding and our
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that these numbers
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
comply with all directives and all
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
Targets and of of course if for some
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
reason there's a thought that that
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
increase shouldn't happen we will will
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
change that but because it's directly
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
correlated to what what is happening and
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
what the chief medical examiner is doing
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
um it I think it's consistent with all
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
all of the directives we got for the
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
budget so that is the efficiency budget
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell um and with that I'll move
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the next two slides the next two
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
slides just provide sort of a
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what percentage of our
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget is General funds
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds other funds inter agency
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
funds Highway funds so this is really
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
just repetitive of what you just saw but
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's just an easy way to see what
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of our budget falls into what
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
category so as you'll note the dep
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
department is less than 50% generally
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
funded but much of our non-general fund
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
dollars are not operational dollars
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
they're dollars we we take in and we
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
slide nine is just to Note new general
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
fund spending again this is all within
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
the Target and it's not really for the
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
most part new things we have some salary
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
and benefit adjustments just for
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
increase in salary and benefits to
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
account for raises and and for benefits
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
going up we have um an increase in the
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
the lease line for the chief medical
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
examiner because they will be moving to
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
new space right now
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
well we currently lease space from
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
conquered hospital and conquered
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
hospital has a vacant building that
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
they'll be renovating that the medical
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
examiner will be moving into our lease
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
payments are going to go up under that
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh new lease again everything's within
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
Target but we just wanted to note what
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
what spending will go up and then we did
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple of small general fund
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
increases where we changed the funding
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
stream for a couple of positions in the
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
office of victim Witnesses system
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
assistance so we had a couple of victim
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
Advocate positions that were I think
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
partially Federal funded partially
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
General funded and we change those to be
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
fully General funded again though it is
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
target moving forward a couple of slides
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
to slide 11 these are our prioritized
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
needs and generally the prioritized
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
needs break down sort of in really into
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
victim service
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
and other law enforcement functions the
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
first big prioritized need are victim of
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
crime grants so we we've talked about
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
this a lot the last few years the
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
Justice receives funding under the
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
federal victims of crime act so we call
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
them Voca grants and over the last I'd
 
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
say five to six years the annual funding
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
received for those Voca grants has been
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
about $10 million we subgrant those
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
dollars out to the Coalition for
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence all of the
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
crisis centers we subgrant those dollars
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
out to Child Advocacy centers we
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
subgrant those dollars out to County
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
attorney offices to provide victim
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
services and Department of Corrections I
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
think some County Corrections so
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
generally we subgrant those dollars out
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
to organizations entities all across the
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
state to provide victim
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
Services those federal funds are being
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
reduced and the reasons for that are a
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
little hard to pinpoint but generally
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
the victims of the VCA Grant dollars
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
have been funded by criminal fines and
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
penalties Federal Criminal fines and
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
penalties those numbers have gone down
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
meaning that there's less money to
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
subgrant out to States so the we've been
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
left with a gap and we had been able to
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
fill that gap for the last few years
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
because the state had saved and
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
stockpiled extra Federal grant money we
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
filled that Gap through through our
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
funds because at one time we thought
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
this was just going to be a temporary
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
dip a few years ago Congress passed what
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
they called the Voca fix was which was
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
to divert some other revenue streams
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
into the victims of crime fund the VCA
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
fund that fix though has not has not
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
worked so we expect that Federal
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
reduction to maintain so in our
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we have at least for
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
consideration basically filling that Gap
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
with General funds um I acknowledge this
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
is not a typical thing we do in the
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
state we typically do not use General
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
funds to pick up programs when federal
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
funds are reduced but we've had these
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
discussions the past couple years we had
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
these discussions with the legislature
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
with the governor and while there have
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
been no promises to anyone as to what
 
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
been no promises to anyone as to what
will

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
happen I think coming out of those
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
discussions we all agreed that at least
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be on the radar for
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
consideration and so just to be
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
transparent and make sure it was seen we
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
put that in our prioritized needs but
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
that is the biggest prioritized need
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
that we have H happy to answer more
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions about that this has been a
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
quite a history with this program with
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
voke over the last few
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
years the next prioritize need we have
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
is a is a human trafficking Grant we
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
took this out of the budget in order to
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
meet our Target this has been a grant
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
that that the department has has put out
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
for the last you know probably 5 to 10
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
years and it funds a position the human
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
trafficking task force and it also um
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
funds A it traditionally has funded a
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
position at a at a County Sheriff's
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
Office although we're not currently
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
doing that now so we lapsed a lot of
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
this $200,000 in fiscal year fiscal year
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
25 so this is this is something we would
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
look to put back in for fiscal year 27
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
we were able to fit this in the budget
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 26 and be within Target
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
we were not able to fit it within the
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget in fiscal year 27 to be within
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
Target the next prioritize need is is a
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
small one but it would be converting a
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
part-time Cal Case Investigator to
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
full-time and the numbers there are are
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
listed and then at the bottom here this
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
is not technically a prioritized need
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
but I think it it should be
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
noted the child advocacy centers
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
received $3 million at the $3 million
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
propriation in hb2 that money is
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
actually appropriated to the doj so that
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
it can be granted to the child advocacy
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
centers and the internet crimes against
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
children task force received an $800,000
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation in hb2 uh for the last
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
bium and we just note that we would
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate requesting those same
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to hold them level it's
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
not really a prioritize need these these
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
at least since I've been in state
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
government this money has come into the
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
budget through hb2 Appropriations so we
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
just anticipate doing the same thing but
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to note it here on the
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs list because it if it
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
is ultimately funded at hb2 it is money
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's appropriated to the doj so that
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
we can subgrant it out to the child
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
advocacy centers and to the the internet
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
force so that is our prioritized needs
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
um the last two slides here we just have
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
some helpful stats I won't go through
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
them one by one but the first slide here
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
just gives you a sense of of what the
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
Department's doing and and some of the
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
numbers some stats and then the last
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
slide which I always like to include
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
because I think in budget season it's a
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
helpful reminder that the doj does bring
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
in some money so this this slide here
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
just shows you the money that that comes
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
in and also the money that we that we
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
manage so it is the budget presentation
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a it's a good reminder
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we bring in some money too we don't
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
just spend it so with that happy to take
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
any questions great thank you Mr
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general uh with that I'll kind
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
of go around see if there's any
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
questions either from our friends in the
 
00:56:58.119 --> 00:57:01.309 align:start position:0%
questions either from our friends in the
legislature

00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
Charlie yeah I did J go ahead uh one one
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
quick question if you could talk about
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
your uh vacancy rates and how they've
 
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
changed since we did this two years ago
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
especially the luck you've had or
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
success you've had in hiring attorneys
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
yep it's a great question so our our
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now if you count
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
permanent positions is about 12.68%
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
so it's higher than we want it to be it
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
is certainly better than it was I think
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago I think this I don't
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak out of turn I think the
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
state averages is it 15 to 16% it so I
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
think we're I think we're under the
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
state average but we're we're still not
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
exactly where we want to be if you only
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
count permanent positions our total
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is is 10 uh
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
26% so that is that's across attorneys
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
and staff we
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
have 13 vacant attorney positions right
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
now that's out of a total position count
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
of 88 what I would note for that though
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
is we have more attorneys than we had a
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
few years ago so we have we got a lot of
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
positions in the last budget and I so
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
part of what happens is we we fill a new
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
position one example is the data privacy
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
unit the legislature create passed the
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
new data Privacy Act we have the new
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
data privacy unit an attorney internally
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
is taking the data privacy attorney
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
position so now we're trying to fill
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
fill that position but we we have 13
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
attorney vacancies we have more
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
attorneys than we did a few years ago we
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
got a lot of positions in the last
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm going to say this it's
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
not the type of thing I think an agency
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
head would usually say I think that we
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
we may have more positions than we need
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
we may have more we may have some
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
additional positions we can unfund but
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
we also have additional positions we're
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
fill Ken wer just got really excited
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
yeah no we appreciate that we appreciate
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
that again it's definitely one of the
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
more important agencies in terms of you
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
never want to say well I can't help you
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
because we didn't hire enough attorneys
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
to help you to a citizen right so you
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
always want to make sure you're you're
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
plenty staff but finding that happy
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
medium I think is is obviously a
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
critical critical
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
Ro good can I um I just had a question
 
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:21.039 align:start position:0%
the the one is the um just a note about
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
hille 2 requests because I suspect some
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
people are listening um over the last
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
few budgets we've done spending in House
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 which is
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
unusual and um was I think a um a clever
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
way of of trying to set aside money um
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
that might not recur for a one-time
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
spending it's very unlikely in the in
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
the upcoming budget that there will be
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
extra money that can be spent so so I
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
think we're probably likely to go back
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
to the the old reality where Hill 2 does
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
not include dollars in it and that just
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
heads up because you may need to come up
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
um some alternate arrangement for that
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to say about
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
about vacancy rates just because it will
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
come up a lot
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people in the audience are
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
well aware that I hate vacancy rates I
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
think it's like the worst measure on the
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
planet um how many positions you have as
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
a measure for example the state
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
currently has a 16% vac so-called
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate many of which positions are
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
not being recruited and we have more
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
people working for the State of New
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today than it any time since
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
2011 um and it's worth noting that and
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
largely because of some of the
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
initiatives the the outgoing Governor I
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
guess I should say has taken but um I
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
would bring that up
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
um secondly have you done any thought
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
about let's say your target changes have
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
you internally done some thinking about
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
where you would find those
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
dollars we have absolutely Ely so we not
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
asking you to tell me them now we've
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
been through the budget and we have a
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
list of additional things um you
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
know yes I I won't list them all but
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're ready if if additional cuts are
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
done okay great well thank you Mr
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general thank you guys for for
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
coming up we're going to take a a five
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
minute break and then we'll continue on
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
with the Human Rights Commission yes uh
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
I ask everyone if they could take their
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick overview of the commission
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
um we are the state agency that enforces
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
the laws against discrimination in New
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we're comprised of SE seven
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer Commissioners who are
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor an executive
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
Council um and we established in
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
1965 and we eliminate discrimination in
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the areas of employment housing public
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
accommodation and just as of 2019 we now
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
do public education K through
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
12 um we also do education and Outreach
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
and we have a workshare agreement with
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
the EEOC so they provide us 15% of their
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
funding our current organization
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
chart um is on page 17 of our
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
presentation as you can see Governor
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
executive counsil our commissioners the
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
executive director we currently have
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
eight full-time investigators one
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
full-time intake coordinator a part-time
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
intake coordinator a full-time paralal
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
and our secretary position is currently
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
vacant right now um but we did meet so
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
we did meet our Target budget for this
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
pass by NM um on page 18 you will see
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
that work share agreement that I
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
referenced with the
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
EEOC um they pay us on a voucher based
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
annual um process our average yearly
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
contract with EEOC is about
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
195 um so as you can see we are very
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
good at meeting that contract or
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
exceeding that
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
number um getting into the numbers on
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
the past few years over at the
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
commission you'll see we have seen a 60%
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
increase in cases filed um which is a
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
very significant jump over the past 5
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
years um and as such the backlog of
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
cases therefore also grows so that leads
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
us to my prioritized needs where we are
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
requesting a couple different things we
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
are requesting two more
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
investigators we are requesting a
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
mediation specialist and we are
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
requesting a Learning and Development
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
specialist which would be more of an
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
Outreach coordinator which could provide
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
some training and education um to both
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
those State agencies and businesses and
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
state and I think that covers it so I'm
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
have representative wer thank you uh
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
what do you think caus this increase in
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
in these
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
cases part any particular thing yeah
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's actually great question I think
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
part of it our executive director in the
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
past couple years really has done a good
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
job Outreach of
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
getting um I want to say the employee
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
side of Outreach so people know that we
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
exist and I think at the same time we
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
need to counter that with the employer
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
education for prevention of these
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
complaints um so I think we've done a
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
good job of letting folks know what
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
their rights are and where to find us
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
but not so much a good job of letting
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
these so is there any particular
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
Department that seems to have more
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
complaints than
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
another well we do state agencies and
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
private businesses any business that has
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
six or more employees and we also cover
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
um some federal contractors depending um
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
so there are depending it's usually
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
depending on size so the more employees
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
you have the more complaints you might
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
have thank you thank you
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you when when a
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
case is filed on average how long does
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
it take to get that case
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
resolved and um what's sort of
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
the you know if if I were to file a a
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
case on average how long would that
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
really be if you'd be able to resolve
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
that case and I I see you have the uh
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
average cases pending is that total
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding cases from the charges that
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
were filed or cases that were filed in
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
the Char to the left yes so those are
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
what are waiting to be assigned to a an
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
investigator for a while we only had
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
four investigators so as the cases came
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
in you can only assign so many per month
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
as they go out um so right now because
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
we had been able to increase staff it
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
took only less than a year to get the
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
case actually assigned which previously
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
we were looking at two years before a
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
case was even assigned so to get it
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
fully resolved depending which Avenue we
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
offer different avenues for resolution
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
um but if you're talking about just for
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
a full investigation with one finding
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
probably about a year and a half to two
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
you Hi how are you good how are you good
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
um you have cases uh average cases
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
closed cases pending assignment I I
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
suppose there's a third category which
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
is cases closed case pending assignment
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
case currently being worked on right yes
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
I would say yeah that depends on how
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
many investigators we have our
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
investigators carry a case load of an
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
average of 30 at any an average of 30
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
and so you probably have about and you
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
have um how many of your investigators
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
are full right now um I have three
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies right now that I am
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
interviewing for so we should be fully
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
staffed by the end of the year so are
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
you carrying about 150 cases on the book
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
so speak yeah okay no that's good to
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%

funds come from
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
usdol our Bayan budget projection is
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
based on knowledge and expectation of
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
the continuation of our core programs

the department also receives
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding in the form of a
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
funding shortfalls and from which $6
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%

portion of our overall budget Personnel
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
related costs comprise approximately 61%
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
of our budget uh when unemployment
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
claims increase as was experienced
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic New Hampshire
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
employment security receives additional
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds based on workloads and
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
excess of our base budget workload
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
counts a growing economy and low
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate like New Hampshire's
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
currently experienc results and
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
decreased funding for New Hampshire
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
employment security the total number of
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
full-time nhes staff is currently at
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
282 and uh the highest point of Staffing
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
reached during the pandemic was
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
355 equivalent positions in April of
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
2020 uh during the 2020 21 pandemic the
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
department managed to pay over $2
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
billion in federal and state
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits to over7 75,000

granted state workers which was more
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
money more more money and more people
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
paid than during the prior decade
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
combined the department of Information
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
Technology costs comprise approximately
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
12% of our overall budget uh with this
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
budget uh Employment Security supports
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 23.2 full-time equivalent
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
do positions with 16 that are embedded
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
in Employment Security uh Employment
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
Security relies heavily on technology to
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
administer all our programs but more
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
importantly unemployment insurance
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
programs therefore in addition of class
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
27 doit our software equipment and
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
equipment related maintenance budget
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
represents approximately 10% of the
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
overall budget the job training fund
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
receives 6 million annually which
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
represents about 10% of our overall
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
budget this fund provides support to
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
employers and individual job Seekers the
 
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
remaining 7% is comprised of General
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
operating exp expenditure such as
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
telecommunications postage utilities as

necessarily a budget related item for
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
the Department it's important to note
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we continue to partner with charlyy
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
providing the essential services to the
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you uh quick
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
question for you you currently you have
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
as you said 282 people that went up to
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
355 at the height of the pandemic uh to
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the the massive yeah the
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
temporary high unemployment well and the
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic you
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
got to remember that you know on Friday
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
of that week everything was fine on
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
Monday everything collapsed so basically
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
when we're talking
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
355 we had the additional staff that
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
were working we were all working seven
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
days a week at that point just to get us
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
through because there was no time to
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
train staff to bring staff in and train
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
staff in order to assist with the
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
workload so so as of that Monday the
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
Monday the pandemic started we were
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
basically everybody in the department
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
was working uh was working the overtime
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
hours Monday through Saturday uh Sunday
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
through Saturday excuse me and uh to to
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
Encompass that 355 number it was the
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
equivalent of
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
355 with with the state's current low
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate I take it the 282 are
 
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
are sufficient but my my my question is
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
how much would the unemployment rate
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
have to rise or is a matter of how
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
quickly it rises in order for that 282
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
that you would need more employees for
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
that um so great question so one of the
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
lessons we learned during the pandemic
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
is that when you get to those High
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
volumes and claims that there was a lot
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
of uh uh problem points in our system in
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
terms of not only for customers but for
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
staff and being able to work efficiently
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
so we've made a lot of changes to allow
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
for staff to be able to deal with those
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
High volumes without the additional
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing um you know depending on how
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
high the claim volume were to go whether
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
that be um something comparable to the
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh Great Recession that we saw or
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
something comparable to more more mild
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
downturn like we saw in the early 2000s
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh we think we can deal with a lot of
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
that um through the improvements that we
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
have made and we continue to make to the
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
I would just note that you have your
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
predecessor former commissioner Reen
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
watching over you in the back of the
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
room I suspect you came only for
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
this um your grants line in your in your
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
department summary went goes from about
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
two and a half to about 5 and a half are
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
those the work those are the work grants
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much the job training
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
sure so um class 73 I believe is what
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
you're referring to well I'm I'm looking
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
at the department summary page okay and
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh page two grants and grants
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
Administration 2.4 in fiscal
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
24 and it's 5.4 I presume that's money
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
set aside for the job training grants
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay and in 24 we didn't expend
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
as much that's an up and down kind of
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
thing it is an up and down correct okay
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
good and just to add to what Jill had
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned so any money that's not
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
expended in the job training grants that
 
01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
does waterfall back into the trust

the past five years to do the focus on

the major upgrade to our 20-year-old

the Strategic plan as you probably know
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system is
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
not an executive branch agency but is a
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
statutorily created pension trust
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
although its expenses flow through the
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
state those costs are reimbursed from
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
the retirement trust which in turn is
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
funded by contributions from employers
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
and members and investment Returns the
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
budget which is before you today has
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
been fully vetted and adopted by our

Board of Trustees who are responsible
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
for approving a budget which is
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for for the system before I
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
go into deeper detail on the operations
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system I would like to
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
share these key facts about

$23,000 more than 60% of our pension
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%

annual net return of 7% over the last 10
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire economy in the last fiscal
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%

01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%

straight 2-year rate cycle the decrease
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%

amount paid to nhrs by employers is
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
expected to increase
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
slightly the nhrs trustees continue to
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
strengthen the plan by adopting updated

decades with a corresponding increase in

waiting for the fiscal year 2024 funded
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
ratio to be finalized by our actuary but
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
we expect to see a small increase I'd
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
like to take a couple of minutes to
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
review the highlights documents and then
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
Finance director Marie Mullen will
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
present highlights from our budget the

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
this over the these are some highlights
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
from the past year we transitioned to an
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
updated pension Administration system
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
platform which replaced a 20-year-old
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
system as you can see from the chart our
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
pension plan plan funded ratio is going
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
in the right direction we've been seeing
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
steady increases Year bye this past year
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
we realized
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
88.8% on investments and the threeyear
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
5year 10e and 25e returns for the
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
periods Ed June 30 2024 were 3.4 7.7 7%
 
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.790 align:start position:0%
periods Ed June 30 2024 were 3.4 7.7 7%
and

01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
6.3% respectively the retirement system
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return is 6 . 75% all
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
returns are net of fees compared to
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
members of the Kalen public funds
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor large Universe greater than $1
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
billion and HRS performed better than
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
70% of its peiod over the past
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
decade as I mentioned earlier each year
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
every four years we get an experience
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
study prepared by our actuary and this
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
time for the first time in more than 20
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
years the actuary did not recommend
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
reducing the assumed rate of investment
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
return which is currently
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
6.75% and in this past year we also
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
issued the june30 2023 financial
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
statements and the gby 68 and 75 reports
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
opinions and initiatives to improve
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency we revamped the strategic
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
planning process and developed a
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
three-year strategic plan for fiscal
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
years 25 through 27 we have modified the
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
fund's asset allocation reducing the
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
allocation to Global equities from 50%
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
to 40% increasing the allocation to
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
private credit by 5% and allocating 5%
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
to infrastructure a new asset category
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
for nhrs that is expected to reduce
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
volatility and provide steady cash flows
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
the allocations changes are being faced
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
in as appropriate o over a multi-year
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
time frame beginning in July
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have also launched an upgrade of the
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
nhrs member and retire online portal my
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
account and we've maintained and
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
expanded various cyber security
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
enhancements designed to protect the
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
there were eight bills related to our
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
statutes that were enacted by the
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and signed into law and all
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
of these required significant database
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
modifications I will now turn things
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
over to director Finance Marie Mullen uh
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
good morning uh to present our agency
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
budget um just a a reminder that these
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
do not include any funds from the
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
general fund and this was created as
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
part of our three-year strategic plan to
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
address deferred initiatives and areas
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
put on hold over the past five years due
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the focus on the major upgrade to our
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
20-year-old pension
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
system the 2-year 38.7 million budget
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
includes a 41% increase for FY 26 over
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
fy22 and a 1% increase for FY 2027 over
 
01:38:43.639 --> 01:38:44.750 align:start position:0%
fy22 and a 1% increase for FY 2027 over
FY

01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
FY
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
2026 these increases are primarily
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
driven by it upgrades modernization
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
projects and salaries and benefits to
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
support new staff positions aligned with
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
the Strategic plan it's also important
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
to note that our administrative budget
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
is 1% of our overall budget for the
 
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.070 align:start position:0%
is 1% of our overall budget for the
retirement

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
system um many of the costs are related
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
to the investment expenses uh for the
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
system in that uh in that
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
regard So Below in the chart um below uh
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
you can see the salaries and benefits
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
and information technology lines uh for
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
information and Technology um the
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
proposed increase is attributable to a
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
backlog of projects um we're looking to
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Implement uh software upgrades for
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
our financial system we're also looking
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
to provide better customer service by
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
implementing um an app for our my
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
account for members to be able to see
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
their information online as well as um
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
upgrading to the cloud in many of our
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
areas uh that modernization is also um
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
the increase in salary and benefits is
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
PR primarily related to additional
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
positions to support those projects uh
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
these positions um are needed in
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
temporary positions as well as
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
consultants to help Implement these
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
projects and uh these those costs would
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
be utilized during this time frame to to
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
help Implement and supplement uh the the
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
staff shortages that may be needed for
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
specific projects
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
for all the other costs uh the primary
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
increase is related to the addition of
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Consultants again to provide
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
implementation services for the various
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
IT projects as well as um increases
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen due to um the cost of uh
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
living increases related to operations
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
including utilities repairs and
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we open up for any questions you
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
have for our our
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
budget okay thank you representative
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
Wilder thank you I continue to be
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
disappointed at your um Returns on
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
investments and of course that's the key
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh source of the of the benefits that
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're paying out and you show your your
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
three-year return of
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
3.4% uh in some of those years when I
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
went to look up what was the investment
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
that year
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
I couldn't find anything but we assume
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
6.75 you don't you don't uh publish it
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
when it's a low return these are much
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
lower than my own Ira that has
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable returns and I'm assuming you
 
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
have similar Investments or similar
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
Investments are available to you so I'm
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that some of the assumptions that
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
you made to pay off this this deficit
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
were increases in employment by the
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
state which I don't don't think is
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
happening not only because of more
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in in it but also with the
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
problems with hiring we have a 16% rate
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
so I think you should reexamine some of
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
the assumptions made to pay off this
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
debt because if if we're not employed at
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
the rate you presumed or we're not
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
increasing employment at the rate you
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
presumed the the funds won't be coming
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
in so I think you need to look at a lot
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
of your figures especially
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
the investment returns have been
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
disappointing in previous years and you
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
know now even now they're still a little
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
bit below what some of us are making in
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
our own Ira so anyway that I'm hoping
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
you yeah um I was wondering if you could
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
my my question relates on page three of
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
your presentation I just want to make
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
sure I have these numbers correct in
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
2019 your budget was
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
8 um the actual 8.7 million going up to
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
roughly 13.6 million in 2025 and that's
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
roughly a 57% increase on top of that
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
57% increase you have now passed a 41%
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
increase for a total increase from 2019
 
01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:17.629 align:start position:0%
increase for a total increase from 2019
to

01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
20127 of a roughly
 
01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
123% am I reading that correctly
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes you are in in 2019 is when our
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
pension gold implementation began so
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
that's where you're seeing the increases
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
over that fiveyear period we had a uh a
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
significant um our main software system
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
of pension gold was upgraded and began
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
in that year so that's where you're
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the increase there is
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
incrementally each year we we had to um
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
pay those implementation costs for that
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
software okay and when your when your
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
board passed the 41%
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh increase in your budget uh what sort
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
of Outreach was done to uh to your
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
constituents whether it's to the to the
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislature or the unions to the cities
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
and towns that pay in uh how are they
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
notified or involved or what Outreach
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
please um what we did did did was we
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
work work we work closely with our board
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
and staff to develop a strategic plan to
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
come up with initiatives that were had
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
been unaddressed over the five past
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
years the pension the pension
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
gold pension Administration system took
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
basically all of our bandwidth over that
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period and because of that we
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
were not able to do other routine
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and so is we're based so
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing in FY 25 26 rather is
 
01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
basically 5 years of deferred projects
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we were not able to do while we
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
were conducting the upgrade to our
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
software hi
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm reading this right that
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
of the 19 to 24 increase 1.8 million of
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
it was pension gold
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the $5 million increase and that 2.8
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
million in your current budget goes to
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
about four between four and four and a
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
half is that
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
right I'm seeing your software line at
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
4.1 yes Y is there another line that I
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
should look at to get I what's the
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
equivalent PG V3 budget number for let's
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
call it
 
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
26 if you were to do it
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
ballpark uh the
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
the pgb 3 is included in that 26 and 27
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
number so we have ongoing annual
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance now that we have to provide
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
for pgb 3 so that is now included in the
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
it budget instead of being broken out
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
separately and as well as the new
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
projects we have for U ongoing so it's a
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
subset of the 4.1 yes that's correct
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
okay and included in the it budget we do
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
so have some additional enhancements
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
um that need to be done to the system as
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
well cool okay um can you one thing that
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
jumps out in looking at your budget your
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
class 45 line which was 7.2 million in
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
24 dips to 59,000 yeah walk me through
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
that uh that was uh with regards to some
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
hb2 legislation for a one-time um TSA
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
$500 so there was $7.1 Million yeah yeah
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um and that's how it gets
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated uh the general funds get
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated it gets put into our budget
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
so then you don't see that in the future
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
years so I knew there was something
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
wonky um my next question is on the uh
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
paying off the UA um what year did we
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
start paying off the the the ability
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
through like we did a 20-year plan I
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
think it was maybe it was a 30-year plan
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
to pay off the initial unfunded
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
liability which was a big number like
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
billion um yes that began those that
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
plan began in
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
2010 so that part will be paid off in
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
2030 yes and how many no no it's 30
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
years it's 30 years okay 2040 how many
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
billions is that well right now it's
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
approximately $5 billion and then
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's another um 500 million that
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
represents gains and losses that have
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
been accured since 2017 which has a
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
separate 20-year amortization period so
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
we're paying off the five billion over
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
the 30 years from 10 to 40 and we're
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
paying off another half a billion are we
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
getting further it sounds like sounds
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
like every year we're a little bit
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
short no we are getting ahead every year
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have finally turned the corner and
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
each year the amount the total amount of
 
01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability has been
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
decreasing but simply because we're
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
paying it off like we're we're acre
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
more right like in theory if we weren't
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
acre more the you wouldn't have to pay
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
off another 500 million right we do so
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
we get further behind no we do pension
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
plans work
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
in this manner every year you would do
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
AC additional liabilities because we
 
01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.950 align:start position:0%
AC additional liabilities because we
have

01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
408,000 members that are working and the
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
benefit and their salaries relates to
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
additional benefits that get AC Creed
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
each year so that increases the
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
liability so the 500 million that you're
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
paying off over 20 years is just sort of
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing business it's always going to be
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
another 500 million no we we're hoping
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
that that will be fully paid off by the
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
end of that 20
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
years and no more
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
acred there may be depending upon if
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
there's gains or losses but generally
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
barring a
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
recession W yes it's it's all trending
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
down okay good Senator gr um correct me
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but the 500 million that
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about comes from
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that has passed during those
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
calendar years and that affects the rate
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
at which you would charge but since you
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
don't set the rate until a couple of
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
years afterward a lot of times then
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
there is this liability that's
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
outstanding which increases the unfunded
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
liability which is subject to being paid
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
off in that 20-year
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
period um yes thank you um Senator that
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons that the unfunded
 
01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:03.639 align:start position:0%
liability since 2017 increases is
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
benefits see no more questions thank you
 
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
and next we have now we have the Liquor
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
good morning good
 
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
morning pleasure to be here thanks for
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
having us I'm Joe Malik I'm the chairman
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission and with me is
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
our CFO Tina deir
 
01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just run through a few
 
01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
comments before we get into the budget
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
before Tina gets into the
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
budget so just to speak a little bit of
 
01:52:01.719 --> 01:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
budget so just to speak a little bit of
regional

01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
regional
 
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
competition New Hampshire's two
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
bordering states uh Vermont and Maine
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
are both control States they have a
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
little bit different model than we have
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
historically they do not have any
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
state-owned stores they're private
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
retailers that own the stores and they
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
make Revenue off of the markup through
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
through those stores and a percentage
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
that they take Massachusetts Connecticut
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island are open States and they
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a mix of local package stores
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
grocery chain stores and big box
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
stores and in Massachusetts there's a
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
Total Wine in spirits is the largest uh
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
liquor alcohol retailer in the United
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
States with revenues of over six billion
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
dollar uh in 2023 they have 270 stores
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
in 2016 States Total Wine added 18
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
stores new locations in 2023 across the
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
states and they're planning 20 new
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
stores in 2024 and
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
2025 uh they're our largest competition
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
they have a total of eight stores in
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which they have built
 
01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which they have built
since

01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
2015 and they have four stores in
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Connecticut and
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts combined about 30% of our
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.629 align:start position:0%
 
take

01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
so Spirit sales to retailers in the
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
United States are continuing to decline
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
AR expected to decline in
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
2025 as premiumization slows down data
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
from Wine and Spirits wholesalers uh IE
 
01:53:48.510 --> 01:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
wswa which looks at wholesalers uh and
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
retailers sales they've audited and uh
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
more than 450 retailers Nationwide and
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
they they believe that the negative
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
trends for spirits will continue in 24
 
01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.149 align:start position:0%
trends for spirits will continue in 24
and

01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
25 we saw this trend starting uh in
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
2023 according to drink marican analysis
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
these are a few things that we look at
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
Spirits declined by 2% by volume in the
 
01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
United States in
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
2023 and the most interesting note is
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
this was the first dip in the category
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
of alcohol sales in the United States in
 
01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.629 align:start position:0%
of alcohol sales in the United States in
30

01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
years so based on the wswa data source
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
the spirit sector uh seeing a decrease
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
across the states uh at
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
5.65% for 2024 and they're expecting
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
another 5.4% in 2025 they run a June to
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
do so sip Source analysis which is
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
another contributor that we use has
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
attributed the downturn and the
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
regression to the pandemic consumer
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
levels broader economic challenges to
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
Consumers as well as and most
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
importantly cannabis substitutes for
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol across the states and a move
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
general we'll move to the the
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
handout and look at page two just a
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
couple of quick notes that the Liquor
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
Commission is
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
self-funded we're in a separate the
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's a separate fund outside of the
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
general fund and no general fund
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are used to maintain the
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
operations of the Liquor
 
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
Commission uh we are reside and live in
 
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.910 align:start position:0%
Commission uh we are reside and live in
RSA

01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:55:44.589 --> 01:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
1763 which is down the bottom and those
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
are the those are
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
the outlines of the commissions to
 
01:55:52.589 --> 01:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
operate profitably to maintain proper
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
controls effective and uh responsible
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
operation of the commission and provide
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
service to our customers of the
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
commission and at this point CFO Demir
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
will take you through our budget thank
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
much good morning so starting on page
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
three you'll see our Revenue estimates
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
and since we are self-funded our
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
projected revenue is dependent on the
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
budget we are requesting so
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the industry T
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
industry Trends and the um no increase
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the budget for FY 26 and only an
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
increase for steps and benefits in 27
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections are relatively
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
flat and you'll see that on Row
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
one row two and three are the transfers
 
01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
per the two rsas governing Revenue
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
transfers prior to the general fund the
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
rsas are listed at the bottom of the
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
page and have been calculated in our
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
plan numbers the first transfer
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
requirement is under RSA
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
17616 that's the 5% of Prior year gross
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
profit um it was 10.7 million in 24
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
incre and 25 and then increasing to 10.8
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
and 10.9 in 26 and
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
27 line three is the transfer per RSA
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
126 AA colon 3 and is estimated by HHS
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
for the granted advantage in FY 24 it
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
was 7.2 million this year it's increased
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
to 12.2 million and for FY 26 and 27
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's at 12.6 and 13
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
million so for the total transfer of
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
other funds on row four you'll see in 24
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's 17.9 million increasing to 22.9
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
million and 25 and then 26 and 27 is
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
23.4 million and 23.9
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
million line five then is the
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
calculation of the liquor Revenue
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund which is
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
flat with the increase in Revenue um the
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
slight increase in Revenue being
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
transferred to those other funds and
 
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
then on line six is the beer tax revenue
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
which continues to be flat and then line
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
seven gives you the total transfer to
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
the general fund so I'd just like to
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
quickly note that in the National Trends
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
you've seen the percentages what they're
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
expecting people to be down and what
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
they actually are down we aren't
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing that type of of loss here
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
in in the state of New Hampshire but we
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
are experiencing it just being flat so
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
shape on page four is a listing of our
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
major expense categories and they
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
correspond to the table and the line
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've identified on page
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
five uh salaries and benefits are 45% of
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
the total budget and the area with the
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
largest increases 1.7 million or 3.4% in
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
FY 26 and 1.5 million or 2.9% in FY
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
27 the FY 26 increase is offset by
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
decreases in uh technology hardware and
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
software doit debt services and workers
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
comp um that's to come to the budget
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
Target number for 26 that's equal to 25
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
and then the increases in FY 27 are
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the position step
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
increases and benefits and then FY 27 is
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
also offset by some decreases the
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
services so on page six and seven this
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
shows you the annual breakdown by class
 
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
and accounting unit you'll see the
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown is consistent for both years
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the class and by the accounting type
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
or the accounting unit um as mentioned
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
FY 26 is flat and FY 27 operating budget
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh increas is 1.3 million or 1.4%
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
$500,000 transfers to HHS I did forget
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
to mention on um page five you'll see
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
that uh line 12 we've included the
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
transfer to the alcohol fund into
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage as a budget item to
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
tracked so back to page six um by class
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
the largest category is salaries and
 
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
benefits at 45% % and then the transfer
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
to HHS is 20% and then our rents is 10%
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
and the rest are fairly minimal and then
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
by accounting unit uh store operations
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
is 79% of the total
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
budget you'll see that's the same on
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
page seven same similar
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown on page eight is uh our
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
organizational structure the commission
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
is m is currently made up of three
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
divisions that report to the chairman
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
and the Deputy Commissioner this chart
 
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
shows each division with the number of
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
unclassified and classified positions
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
assigned along with the list of areas of
 
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility and one of and one of the
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
things that we'll be asking for in hb2
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
that which has been in our audit
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
findings for the last couple of years
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
which we've waited to put into place
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
till we've launched our new NextGen
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
system we've gone from the old system to
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
the new system this year we're nine
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
months in the old system and three
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
months in the new system but we'll be
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
asking asking for a Director of Finance
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
and audit which would be an additional
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
director to the commission and it's
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
something that the LBA is suggested uh
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we're in agreement with it now that
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
place so back to uh page 9 through 13
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
these are summaries of the divisions as
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
listed in the budget uh request with
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
page references to the book and there's
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
a pie chart that shows the breakdown by
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
class category and explains the changes
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
so on page nine is the office of the
 
02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
commission they're overseeing all
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
operations of the commission with the
 
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
primary goal to increase sales and
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
maximize profits while operating in a
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
cost effective and efficient manner uh
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits in 26 uh decrease
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
is a result of one position moving to
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
the division of
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
administration and the operations has a
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
net increase of 115,000 in FY 26 this is
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
for um reallocation of indirect costs
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
and then decrease in current expense and
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
contracts and then FY 27 is the increase
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
for salaries and
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
benefits on page 10 the division of
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh includes enforcement
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
licensing education and grants the
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
division is responsible for enforcing
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverage laws enforcing youth
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
youth access to tobacco and providing
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
licensing education and support to to
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
over 6,100 lenses the 26 um increase is
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
a result of moving five part-time
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
positions from other divisions for a new
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
outlets on page 11 the division of
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
administration this includes uh Finance
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
HR audit inventory control and legal and
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
then also moving in 13 positions from
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
other divisions for moving in real
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
estate the uh maintenance department
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
along with a newly created uh Systems
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
Support for the new nextg
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
system and you'll notice that those are
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
eight positions those eight positions uh
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
as part of the restructure of the
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
commission uh with the new nextg system
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
these will just be people that will
 
02:03:49.229 --> 02:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
support the next gen system and we are
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
working with doit currently now to look
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
at we're having a final meeting with
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
them this week to look at changing the
 
02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
structure of our
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
doit in order to help with the financing
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
of some of these systems again this is
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
part of the audit mention and uh we have
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
a wonderful team in place it's really
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
been a good system uh the most important
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
thing for us about this system is that
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
when we changed over the the biggest
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
goal was that the the folks that are in
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
the stores didn't notice the change and
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
and the licenses didn't notice the
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
change that was the biggest piece and
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
90% of that has been achieved we had
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
some issues with larger licenses and
 
02:04:33.549 --> 02:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
ordering which has been taken care of
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
but for the most part through the summer
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
no one noticed any difference in the
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
stores the the product went one way and
 
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
the cash came into the registers and
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's what we're here to do so thank
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
you so moving on to page 12 the division
 
02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
of marketing and Merchandising this
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
includes marketing merchandising
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
advertising the retail store outlets and
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
the HQ Warehouse the division oversees
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
the buying marketing selling and
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
distributing of products through all of
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
our channels to promote sales and
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
maximize profits uh the FY 26 decrease
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
is are from the position moves um
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction to debt services and
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
the technology Hardware software and
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
utilities uh FY 25 3.9% or 2.7 million
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
increase mainly for salary oh I'm sorry
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.549 --> 02:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
benefits just quickly like to comment
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
there that we run all of our Outlets all
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
of our 62 Outlets with uh
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
268 Personnel full-time personnel which
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
is quite an achievement in itself and in
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
the in the vicinity of about 700
 
02:05:45.679 --> 02:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
the in the vicinity of about 700
part-time

02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
Personnel so on page 13 workers comp and
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment comp um workers comp is has
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
decreased and the number is based on the
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
um previous Trend and unemployment comp
 
02:06:04.159 --> 02:06:06.229 align:start position:0%
um previous Trend and unemployment comp
is

02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
flat the last slide is um additional
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
changes in a a capital request um that
 
02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to bring attention to uh
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
the additional changes are for those
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
eight positions as we've looked at the
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
restructuring to move them out of the
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
division of administration and move them
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
under marketing and we're looking to put
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
in a new capital request that has
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
recently come to light um to replace the
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
current licensing Enterprise solution
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
Software System known as um mllo my
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
office online it's a platform is
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
reaching its end of life and we recently
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
learned that oplc and D are moving away
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
from the original plan of an Enterprise
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
licensing solution for multiple state
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and the Liquor Commission is no
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
longer included in that licensing
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
software so in order to maintain our
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
Licensing Operations we need a new
 
02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
Licensing Operations we need a new
licensing

02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
platform which is estimated at about $4
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
million currently but we still have to
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
do further
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
research we'd be happy to take any
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you very
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
wer uh thank you thank you commissioner
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
as somewhat unre related area your
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
mention of the facts that some of the
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
surrounding states were losing liquor
 
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
sales to
 
02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis so some of the that that did
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
not come up in our discussions of
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
bringing cannabis to our state and
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
legalizing it I would request that you
 
02:07:43.549 --> 02:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
show me some
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
data from the other states where after
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
they went
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
legalizing uh cannabis it's a effect on
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
their liquor sales so that I can bring
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
that up excuse me when we when we talk
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
about cannabis again that it's not
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
without some effects on some of our
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
other Revenue I think that's an
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
important point that has not been made
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
at this point that if that's going to
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
we'll hear all how we going to make
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
money here but if we're going to lose
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
money there we've got to take that into
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
account as well so I appreciate those
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
those figures you mentioned certainly
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay I just have a a quick question when
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
you were here two years ago one of the
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh largest issues that you were facing
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
is is finding sufficient workers to keep
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
your stores open uh in the hours that
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
you you you wish to has that problem
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
been resolved satisfactorily can you now
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
do you now have a sufficient employment
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
base to keep all your stores open to the
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
hours you deem necessary we have a
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
number of positions that we were given
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the last budget that we have held
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
some we have not been able to fill and
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
we are still quite frankly having a
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time filling positions uh
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the rate of pay at $165
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour is not keeping Pace with
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Private Industry so we're still
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of folks that part- timr
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
specifically uh which obviously we rely
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
heavily on with 700 plus or minus uh we
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
have seen us not be able to hire in the
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
times that we have we have exp expanded
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
the hours in the stores uh with the
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
cutbacks of the stores through covid and
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
through attrition as we open larger
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
stores like the new store in Keen we
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
just opened a couple weeks ago we're
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
finding it a little easier to run the
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
stores because we have the larger
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
footprint and not so many smaller stores
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that's a benefit to us but that
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
Private Industry is still paying $189 19
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
$20 an hour where're at $165 an hour is
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
still a challenge so the answer is yes
 
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
and no we've certain we've certainly
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
been able to hire some additional folks
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that's been great and I think that a
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
lot of folks that are coming out of
 
02:10:09.790 --> 02:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
retirement that previously had enough
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
funds to live but due to the economy now
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't we've hired a lot of people out of
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
us I'm car hi I'm curious how many
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
um how many vacancies you have roughly
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
right now and I know it's a number
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
that's in flux but I wonder if you could
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
divide them among full-timers I know the
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
part-timers are up and down um can you
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
divide them into the the the uh
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
merchandising section and then the other
 
02:10:46.109 --> 02:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
three so the 280 marketing and
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
Merchandising which I think is mostly
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
store operations and then the other 87
 
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
or 90 Whatever It Is So currently we
 
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
have 26 um vacant positions there's um
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
one in finance two in finance and
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
the there's two it looks like in
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then the rest are in
 
02:11:10.679 --> 02:11:12.709 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then the rest are in
store

02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
operations and I'm sorry that's 23 you
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
said 26 currently
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
26 so it's like 22 in in uh although not
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
bad on
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
286 um I noticed in your agency budget
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
your your position count doesn't change
 
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
and so I assume all that I'm guessing
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
that this just means you're yes okay and
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
that's also true with a house bill two
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
item you want that's replacing an
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
existing position because it's not
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
listed here no that would be a new
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
position oh it's not in your agency
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
budget no no it's not I I would I'm
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to say this probably a lot of over
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
the next 3 days um House Bill 2 um over
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years has been used
 
02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
weirdly um in large part because of
 
02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
surplus funds but technically nothing
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
Financial should be in that document
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
anything financial needs to also be in
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
house bill one and and so and maybe not
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
in the agency phase but just make sure
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
that when you do your budget because you
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't have anything in House Bill 2
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's not accounted for in house bill
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
one absolutely cuz I think there's not
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
going to be if I were guessing Surplus
 
02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:21.790 align:start position:0%
going to be if I were guessing Surplus
money

02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
I think the governor guessed that too
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
when he said he said in the opening
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
something about 4% reductions that was
 
02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
what he was guessing
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
break okay we're going to take a a
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
couple of minute break and uh we'll be
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.119 --> 02:13:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
15

02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.040 --> 02:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:50.030 align:start position:0%

02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%

02:18:28.830 --> 02:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we' like to resume the
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and would like to call up now
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
Agriculture morning commissioner
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
morning on my button for the record I am
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
Sean Jas commissioner of the Department
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture markets and food I have
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
with me this morning Michelle tibo our
 
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and Joshua
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
Marshall the assistant
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I will try to give you
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
back some of your time and be as brief
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
as I can uh and this budget has been
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
developed to meet the efficiency
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
expenditure targets provided by the
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office the goal of the
 
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
department is to retain current Staffing
 
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
levels and maintain the Integrity of all
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
programs as a result the following
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
programs have been affected by a reu
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
reduction in general funds cost of care
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
fund the state Agricultural Fair grants
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
the agricultural land
 
02:19:33.309 --> 02:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
preservations uh program and the Farm
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
Ranch stress assistance program all of
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
those have been reduced to roughly
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
20,000 uh on average for each of the two
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
years and I think you have
 
02:19:49.389 --> 02:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
can uh access what what was in the
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
budget they're pretty subst stantial
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
reductions uh based on previous years
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture gives back
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
to the general fund uh about 200,000 a
 
02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
year meaning that we are cash positive
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
to the state uh by about that amount and
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
we expect to continue to remain cash
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
positive um the fund balance for our
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
agricultural products regulatory fund at
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
the end of uh fiscal 27 we expect to be
 
02:20:23.469 --> 02:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
1,684 th000 in graded Pest Management um
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
by the end of the same period about 1.1
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
million that's important because of
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to to mention um as
 
02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
we go through here we are in order to
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
maintain the budget we are relying more
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
on these These funds we are drawing them
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
down to maintain our Personnel level
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is not sustainable forever I've
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
said this in the past but the fund
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
balances are are decreasing over time
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is also where we um
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
are pulling have pulled money from in
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
the past for the animal data records
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
based program when I became commissioner
 
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
in 2017 I said I hoped at the end of my
 
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
tenure we will have brought our um um
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
systems up to the 1990s um I'm PL
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that by the end of this
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we will be in the 21st
 
02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
century and all of our programs will
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
have been uh modernized the uh animal
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
database program is live now and has
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
been for some time in the testing phase
 
02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
it has not been required for everyone to
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
use it but they will be using it um by
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
law by the first uh part of
 
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
January and um the weights and measures
 
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
program which some of you may remember
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
was developed by a sex offender in the
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
state prison in the
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
1980s um that will finally go away by
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
March uh Lorraine Merill name will come
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
off of the certificates issued they
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
won't have to put mine on a sticker
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
anymore uh we did have a uh contract in
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
place when I became commissioner but
 
02:22:05.230 --> 02:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
that was a total failure and we have
 
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
pivoted and we now have the program we
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
need I just think it was important to
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
mention the it part of things we have
 
02:22:12.439 --> 02:22:13.349 align:start position:0%
mention the it part of things we have
two

02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
requests um in the governor's phase and
 
02:22:20.349 --> 02:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
um that's they're both minor they're a
 
02:22:20.359 --> 02:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
um that's they're both minor they're a
uh

02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
moving of money around and I think you
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
will have those I can certainly go over
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
them in detail if you want but those
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
have been emailed in
 
02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:34.590 align:start position:0%
have been emailed in
um

02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
finally uh well as part of what we've
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
done to uh comply with the governor's
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
request we will be purchasing uh no new
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles with general fund money in the
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
next bium uh no Personnel requests are
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
made in the in the B bium either and um
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
we are trying to do something which we
 
02:23:02.110 --> 02:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
hope the governor's office will go along
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
with we trying to be more transparent
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
with some of our
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures um for many years um the
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
what was the product and scale testing
 
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
fund which did undergo uh legislative
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
changes this year um essentially was
 
02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
used as a slush fund for travel there
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
was no real transparency there we
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
attempted to change that in the last
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
biennium we were unable to do that again
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
so travel appears in lines where it
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't before because we want you to
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
know where it's it's coming from and we
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
don't I I have never been somebody who's
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
been in favor of funds that you can just
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
use willy-nilly and I been trying to end
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
that and I hope that the governor will
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
support that um I want to mention a
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal item that we will be requesting
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh really the only one that involves
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures We'll be asking to be
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
submitted as a bill and that relates to
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
the testing of electronic uh vehicle
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
charging stations under existing law we
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
already have the obligation to test
 
02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
these devices but we don't have the
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
budget for the testing equipment or the
 
02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel to carry out this
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility additionally we also
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
believe that the fee schedule that we
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
would need to apply to this does not
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
work as we believe it should the bill we
 
02:24:26.349 --> 02:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate having filed will address all
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
these issues given the budget
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
constraints and the initial startup
 
02:24:32.269 --> 02:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
costs we will be asking that the first
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
Year's costs come from our dedicated
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
funds as we believe that this program is
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
vital to Consumer
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
Protection uh but we have not asked for
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
it to be part of house bill one or
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
two and we'll be glad to answer any
 
02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
two and we'll be glad to answer any
questions

02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
Hi how are you I am I'm well thank you
 
02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner um Josh good to see you I
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
see you everywhere um the um you have
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
two revolving funds that you list on the
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
on the back page of your presentation do
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
you have a handful of other revolving
 
02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
funds the that are little I think we do
 
02:25:12.269 --> 02:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
have like hearing officer fund yes that
 
02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
that is it's not really it is a fund per
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
se but it's capped at 75,000 per year so
 
02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
from fines that money goes into there up
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
to a maximum of 75,000 and over 75 5,000
 
02:25:27.269 --> 02:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
goes back to the general fund and we
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
this year are sending money back to the
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
the general fund okay and it's that that
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
when you say you give back to the
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
general fund over 200 Grand a year
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's more than just your laps that is
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
more than our that is more than our laps
 
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
that is so we are cash positive to the
 
02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
general fund you know and it varies it's
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
been I've seen it as high as 700
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
$800,000 um I think down into the 70s
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
but on average um we are cash positive
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
to the state general fund to the tune of
 
02:25:59.550 --> 02:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
100 200,000 including
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
lapses okay that's good I I was looking
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
at your unrestricted Revenue um because
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
you collect something like 20125 uh fees
 
02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
Etc that show up as unrestricted Revenue
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the other line I think um and you're
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
budgeting it at 3.3 there's something
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
weird in 25 where it's budgeted at 6
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
million is that just a weirdness that
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
you're not really going to raise 6
 
02:26:25.469 --> 02:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
million I'm looking at like the fourth
 
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
or fifth page of your all right I of the
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
agency but page eight of the agency
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
budget document turn to Michelle for for
 
02:26:35.469 --> 02:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
that answer hopefully that's why we have
 
02:26:35.479 --> 02:26:42.349 align:start position:0%
that answer hopefully that's why we have
Michelle

02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
right you see what I mean looks like
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's a huge increase in weight we
 
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
Master repair licenses but like way
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
Master there's 2.2 for this year I
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
presume that just means you're not going
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
to get 2.2 this year and that it's going
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
to look more like 24 like 24 is more
 
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
real and you use that to build
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
26 that is correct okay that'sa so like
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
when we're when we're tracking when
 
02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're building the revenue line for the
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
for the budget let's say we should be
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
using three for things that are current
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably budgeted in 25 at
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
six yes
 
02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.309 --> 02:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
got thank you very much very good we
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
were able to give you a little your time
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
that like to invite banking give their
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%

um i' like to start my hand out with the
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
Department's mission statement because
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
everything in our budget directly
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
relates to the mission statement and
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
directly supports that mission statement
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
the department accomplishes its Mission
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
by conducting examinations of licensed
 
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
chartered financial institutions
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
investigating consumer complaints
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
bringing enforcement actions when
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%

uh to New Hampshire
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
citizens the budget structure of the
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
banking department is set up in two
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
divisions the Banking and Trust Division
 
02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
and the consumer credit division the
 
02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
Banking and Trust division oversees the
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
activity of 17 State chared Banks seven
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
credit unions and 44 non-depository
 
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
trust companies and family trust
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
companies uh within those trust
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
companies are the trust companies manage
 
02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
about $ 1.6 trillion in assets um and
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire banking department is the
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
primary or and or sole um regulatory
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
authority over those institutions and
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
those institutions are predominantly
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
located outside of the State of New
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so travel is required to
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
examine them additionally we have I
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
believe one that's located outside of
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer credit division oversees
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
several thousand Consumer Credit Credit
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
lenses so thank mortgage companies uh
 
02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
payday payday lenders small loan lenders
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
um retail sellers so auto dealers who
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
take Finance applications and finally
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
money transmitters so like PayPal um
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
meta um several large money transmitter
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
organizations the banking Department
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
amongst those two divisions has 53
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
positions assigned to it including two
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
two currently vacant attorney positions
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
which we are actively recruiting for and
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
hope to fill uh
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
shortly um moving on to our funding
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
structure uh the banking department is a
 
02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:32.110 align:start position:0%
structure uh the banking department is a
self-funded

02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
agency um what that means practically
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
speaking is at the start of each fiscal
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
year we get an appropriation over the
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
course of the year we collect fees and
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
fines application fees examination fees
 
02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
Etc which are credited to that
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation at the end of the fiscal
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
year any shortfall between the
 
02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the those fine fine
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
and fee amounts gets um collected
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
through an assessment on our chartered
 
02:30:57.309 --> 02:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
and licensed entities we usually only
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
have to do an assessment on the
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
chartered entities usually there's
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
enough fees and fines generated by the
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
consumer credit entities that we don't
 
02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
them moving on to our budget proposal uh
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
the banking Department um was directed
 
02:31:16.750 --> 02:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
to Flat fund to the adjusted authorized
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
amount for fiscal year
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
25 um we were permitted in the second
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
year of the budget proposal to um fund
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
statutory and Contra contractual
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
increases in salaries and benefits so
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
this was a challenge for us because we
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
are an agency that's nearly 89% salaries
 
02:31:39.070 --> 02:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
benefits Etc we don't have a lot of
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
stuff that we can cut um so how did we
 
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish that directive um in fiscal
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
year 26 we defunded one of our two doit
 
02:31:49.319 --> 02:31:50.830 align:start position:0%
year 26 we defunded one of our two doit
positions

02:31:50.830 --> 02:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um we currently have a project underway
 
02:31:55.269 --> 02:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
to move most of our data that we
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
currently um utilize at the department
 
02:32:00.429 --> 02:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
into like a vendor manage manage system
 
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's paid for by the dues that we pay
 
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
to a
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
um organizational dues that we pay to
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
our the conference of State Bank
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors um and additionally we are
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
trying to move out of access databases
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
for our internal recordkeeping system
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and into a more modern cloud-based
 
02:32:20.349 --> 02:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
system um and because of that project we
 
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
felt comfortable defunding the one
 
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
position and uh feel like we can move
 
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
forward in that position um we also
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
defunded an attorney position that was
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
embedded at the doj that we no longer
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
use we didn't use the services of so we
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
defunded that
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
position for fiscal year 27 we cut
 
02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
funding to our travel and training lines
 
02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
um while we can live with this cut it is
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a fundamental impact on
 
02:32:50.349 --> 02:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
how we accomplish our mission during the
 
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic we disc we learned and
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
confirmed that we can do exams offsite
 
02:32:57.550 --> 02:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
for one or two exam cycles and feel
 
02:32:59.269 --> 02:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the risk associated
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
with that however conducting
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
examinations fully offsite repeatedly
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
does increase the risk to New Hampshire
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
consumers and the reputational risk to
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole um it's very
 
02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
important that we set foot in the
 
02:33:13.269 --> 02:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
entities that are licensed and chartered
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
by us to see what is going on boots on
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
the ground and all
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
that um in fisc in fiscal year 2024 we
 
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
conducted approximately 370
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
examinations um in fiscal year 25 we are
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
on track to conduct over 400
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
examinations due to statutory changes um
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that require us to now examine all the
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
retail sellers in the that are licensed
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
by us in the state of New
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we feel comfortable that we
 
02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
can absorb that increase because we've
 
02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
been able to reallocate examiner
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
positions across divisions um to do that
 
02:33:52.030 --> 02:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
effectively we have to train those
 
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
people to be able to examine a bank one
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
day a money transmitter the next day and
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
so on um so that does mean that we have
 
02:34:02.429 --> 02:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
some increased training needs for those
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
examiners because many our most
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
increasing area at the department is in
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
complex fintech um companies that are
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
ever changing so training is very very
 
02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
important to us so that our examiners
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
can go out and competently examine those
 
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
entities um and I am concerned that cuts
 
02:34:23.309 --> 02:34:23.319 align:start position:0%
to that training line May exacerbate or
 
02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
put us behind the curve slightly on
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
those training needs but I do think we
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
could live with it uh so that's kind of
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
it for my substantive presentation about
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
the budget um I would draw your
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
attention to the end of the handout um
 
02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:38.950 align:start position:0%
attention to the end of the handout um
in

02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
2023 um we did um achieve uh facilitate
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
over $1 million in restitution for over
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
2,000 New Hampshire consumers um
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
additionally we facilitated resolution
 
02:34:50.190 --> 02:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
over over
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
100 consumer complaints in calendar year
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
2024 to date um I also include a link to
 
02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
our strategic plan if you want to see
 
02:34:58.830 --> 02:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
any further details about what we do at
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
the banking Department what our plans
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
are going forward um I am proud of the
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
work that the department does and I'm
 
02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh the examinations you do uh
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
are they more uh obviously they're I say
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
traditional scheduled examinations but
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
to what extent are they situationally
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
based and and why I ask that is when
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
when interest rates uh shot up over the
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
last few years uh especially over the
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
last year uh a number of banks we we saw
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
the well publicized case out in
 
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
California had significant liquidity
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
crisis does that increase the amount of
 
02:35:41.389 --> 02:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
examinations you're doing here locally
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
or is it just something or or okay
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying yes so you could just go
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
into that in a little more detail sure
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
so um are we do have regularly
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
scheduled examination set by a statute
 
02:35:54.670 --> 02:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
um some entities get examined every 12
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
months 18 months 24 months some are
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
three years some are five years it
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
depends on the entity type so those are
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
routinely done outside of that we have
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to go in if we get a lot of
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints about an institution
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
so when I started at the banking
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
Department it was the height of the
 
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage crisis and I was an enforcement
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
attorney so we went in and did a lot of
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know unannounced sort of
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
visitations or investigations where we
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
went on site um and those were
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
particularly locally for the most part
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
at the time um so it is really e
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
economically driven um with the
 
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
liquidity issues going on we are keeping
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
a close eye on that and we do have um
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
for our banks we have co-regulator we
 
02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
co-regulate banks with the federal
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
government FDIC or the um fed um so we
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
do increase our visitations on site but
 
02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of that work can if it depending
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
on the nature of it really depends on
 
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
do you do you uh in your in your Dunning
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
of in your not done assessment okay your
 
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
assessment of people do you assess the
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
Banking and Trust divisions and Consumer
 
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
Credit divisions separately and as a
 
02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
entity so they have a different set of
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
people you build and you only build for
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
those costs correct so we act that's why
 
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have it in two two buckets for the
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
purposes of the budget people are
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
assigned to either bucket do you do you
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
do an internal cost app for admin yes we
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
do like for you yep yep all of us uh at
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
this table for example are split I am
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
paid out at the banking division he's
 
02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
paid out of the CCD division but CCD for
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
her too um so we do track we try to keep
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
it an even split um based on you know
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
how many entities etc etc so instead of
 
02:37:43.389 --> 02:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
instead of an allocation you do a you do
 
02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
a just like you're here I'm here yeah
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
cuz like we try to keep it even it gets
 
02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
complicated if we have to split a
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
position in half so we tend to do whole
 
02:37:56.429 --> 02:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
positions you say you tend to do you
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
have any I don't think we did at one
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
point in the past but we don't currently
 
02:38:02.269 --> 02:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay I would prefer not to because I
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
think that is complicated I like to keep
 
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
things very very simple Yes simple and
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I I just I asked we actually
 
02:38:11.269 --> 02:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
internally in a couple of places went
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction because it but it
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
was over like 40 places and it was it
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
became inaccurate in your con Consumer
 
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
Credit you have a you have a giant
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
increase in your class
 
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
49 can you explain that remind me which
 
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.429 align:start position:0%
49 can you explain that remind me which
one's

02:38:30.429 --> 02:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
49 like it goes from our grand to 142
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:41.550 --> 02:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
grand I'm looking at page 23 of the
 
02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:44.190 align:start position:0%
grand I'm looking at page 23 of the
agency

02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
budget yeah so that's the
 
02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
EAP division and you're going to stop
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
doing EAP nope nope it did change can I
 
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that yeah no that's
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
fine I just yeah it sort of jumps yeah I
 
02:39:02.309 --> 02:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
think it's tied to EAP so I'm not sure
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's just the cost we get from DHHS
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm guessing it's more than a grand
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
next year though if it was 142 this year
 
02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:11.870 align:start position:0%
next year though if it was 142 this year
well

02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
so because your employee count probably
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
didn't go down that much no it did go up
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
though sorry it did go up our employee
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
count increased to 53 whereas I think
 
02:39:27.790 --> 02:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
before we were 49 or 50 50 mhm right so
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
I would guess then that you would go
 
02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
from like 142 to 150 not 142 to one I
 
02:39:34.110 --> 02:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
think we we also had money in there for
 
02:39:35.950 --> 02:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
two part-time positions that we never
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
used so we eliminated that out of the
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
budget too and I think that might all be
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
in because that's I think 49 is payments
 
02:39:46.110 --> 02:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
oh and that's also the payment to other
 
02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
agency it's the doj position that I
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned so that's where we paid that
 
02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
I apologize let my brain that actually
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably makes more sense yes that does
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
make way more sense I apologize that's
 
02:39:56.590 --> 02:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
okay no big deal I'm not as good with
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
the class numbers is no nobody nobody he
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
us except Michelle okay thank you thank
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.269 --> 02:40:14.279 align:start position:0%

that um I'm Kim McKay I'm the Comon of
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire veterans home and with
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
me today I have our CFO Jennifer dog we
 
02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
do have a a lengthy power presentation
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
but I promise you I'll I'll pul through
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
it pretty quick
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh just for those who don't know about
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
us uh in 1989 or excuse me 1889 uh to
 
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the federal assistance
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
the governor at the time made up the
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
board of managers and started the
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
veterans home so in December December
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
3rd we will actually be having uh our
 
02:41:12.269 --> 02:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
anniversary of 134 years and in 134
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
years there's been 11 commants which is
 
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
pretty impressive there's only been 11
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
leaders there we are made up of a board
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
of managers that oversees our some of
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
our operations so we have a unique
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
position with the board of man managers
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
and they are made up of 12 members who
 
02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
are appointed by the governor and
 
02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the executive Council
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
commanders from the American Legion the
 
02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
veteran of Foreign Affairs and the
 
02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
disabled American veterans and nine
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
citizens make up our Board of managers
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
two of those 12 members are are um
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
members in our res our residents in our
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
facility one one male one female and the
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
board has oversight of the veterans
 
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
benefit fund operations as well as who
 
02:41:58.830 --> 02:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
the commant is um so that's a unique
 
02:42:01.230 --> 02:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
situation in itself that they oversee
 
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
how we spend that uh donated money that
 
02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
comes from our community to support all
 
02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
of our veterans organization or um
 
02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:09.870 align:start position:0%
of our veterans organization or um
recreational

02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
activities today we are a long-term
 
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care Facility and we offer
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
a broad range of residential medical and
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
nursing care for veterans only this is
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
unique because most states have um
 
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
bigger or many more veterans homes so
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
they can offer a placement for spouses
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
or Golds our parents as well but we
 
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have only one veterans
 
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
home and uh we focus on the veterans
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
we're licensed for 250 residents we have
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
been budgeted historically for
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
225 residents and we have 384 staff as I
 
02:42:50.190 --> 02:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
spoke last time and I will probably keep
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to you our greatest challenge
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
has been recruiting and retaining staff
 
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
um with the clinical side and the uh
 
02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:57.950 align:start position:0%
um with the clinical side and the uh
Support

02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
Support
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
Services again uniquely we have um we
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
are uh licensed by the VA and we are um
 
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
enabled to uh act get pum payments
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
through the C 38 CFR
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
5141 and residents um the veterans
 
02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
either have partial pay or full pay for
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
their stay with us us our mission
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
statement of the New Hampshire Veterans
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
Home is to provide the best quality of
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
life for New Hampshire veterans with
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
dignity honor and respect and our staff
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
um are very honored to serve those who
 
02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:33.710 align:start position:0%
um are very honored to serve those who
have

02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
served I talk about achievements because
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
it's really important to show where
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're going and where we've been uh we
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
had created a LNA training licensed
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant training program
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
because we have the biggest need in the
 
02:43:51.309 --> 02:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh nursing field and so in April 22 we
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
started that course and we've had seven
 
02:43:56.590 --> 02:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
courses and have rendered 30 new
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
lnas um and now they are working with us
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
we have also created a licensed
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
medication nursing assistant program
 
02:44:07.309 --> 02:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
which allows lnas who have at least a
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
minimum of a Year's experience to be
 
02:44:13.469 --> 02:44:13.479 align:start position:0%
able to take a course to become um have
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to pass medications under
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
the supervision of a nurse and so we
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
started that program February 2024 and
 
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
we now have 10 new elemes in our um in
 
02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:25.150 align:start position:0%
we now have 10 new elemes in our um in
our

02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce in 2024 we were awarded the
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
outstanding energy efficience project um
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
with a sponsorship provided by
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
eversource and Das um we had a light uh
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
facility wide lighting Improvement
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
project and our hope is that it's going
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
to save us about 50% on our utility
 
02:44:46.349 --> 02:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
bills for lights uh they replaced every
 
02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
single light in our
 
02:44:49.950 --> 02:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
facility we've also improved our
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
security by adding additional security
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
cameras we were uh awarded some enhanced
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
monies um through the sweep and um we've
 
02:45:02.910 --> 02:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
been able to in Phase One improve our um
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
technology structure through our
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
facility we use Med carts that use um
 
02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi and so it was spotty in some areas
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
and now we are able to offer the Wi-Fi
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout the facility as well
 
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
to our residents and phase two will be
 
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
to to have that all upgraded and take
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
place with the new equipment updates for
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
conference rooms to allow to have uh
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
care plan meetings with families and
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
calls with families who are not able to
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
come to the
 
02:45:33.870 --> 02:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
facility one of the proudest things I'm
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to speak about is the
 
02:45:38.670 --> 02:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
admissions process historically uh it
 
02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
has taken about a year to be uh from
 
02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
step one of admitting uh doing your
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
application to the admission and we've
 
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
been able to cut that down to 3 to six
 
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
months months now uh sometimes so fast
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
that families are shocked because it's
 
02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
so quick uh they they were uh planning
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
it to have like a lot more time to uh
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
make that final decision but we are now
 
02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
moving really quickly and we're up to uh
 
02:46:05.950 --> 02:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
3 to six months before they um are
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
offered a bed and we have looked at our
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
contracts that we had and we're
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
minimizing occupational and physical
 
02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
therapy contracts that we had by going
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
to a previous model where we had a
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
full-time physical therapist so we
 
02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
reclassed a position position and we've
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
hired a physical therapist who will
 
02:46:24.670 --> 02:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
oversee our therapy department um and
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
cut some of that contract money down as
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
well as have a benefit to our veterans
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
where they aren't going to have to pay a
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
co-pay uh they right now sometimes
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
refuse therapy because they don't want
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
to pay a co-pay that they were being
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
contractors our staffing as it relates
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
we um and I didn't know that Charlie
 
02:46:48.510 --> 02:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
didn't like um vacancy rates and those
 
02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
kind of things so we'll just slide right
 
02:46:53.309 --> 02:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
through that Charlie um I particularly
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
like the way you did your slide okay all
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you um so with our
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
current vacancy rate of 45 for L uh
 
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
about 46% for lnas and 39% for nurses
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
we've currently capped our consensus at
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
140 uh to meet the needs um with that
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
said we plan to go to the
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
225 and I think that we're on the right
 
02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
path we've had some nursing management
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
changes so we're looking at how we can
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
more effectively use our staff so with
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
the current numbers right now we're uh
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
toying with the idea of going up to 150
 
02:47:31.309 --> 02:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
and uh as we are able to recruit we plan
 
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
to increase that for recruiting uh
 
02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
efforts we've enhanced our efforts by
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
attending job fairs posting on College
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
platforms like handshake uh local
 
02:47:44.830 --> 02:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
newspapers interestingly that still
 
02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
brings people in from our local area uh
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
and adding the ability to obtain uh cus
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
continuing education units that sounds
 
02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
like a small thing but for a nurse or an
 
02:47:59.630 --> 02:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
LNA who needs to maintain their license
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh for us to have a very small cost with
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
a uh educational program called
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare academies we're going to be
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
able to provide cus for those people
 
02:48:10.750 --> 02:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
with licensures um which will then
 
02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
attract more people that can do it on
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
work time we've also Consolidated
 
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
partial units to maximize staff on full
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
units uh We've expanded light duty to uh
 
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
work programs so that when people are in
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
light duty they can come back and do
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
something maybe that wasn't a nursing
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
but something else that's still going to
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
help us where we have vacancies uh We've
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
increased the number of volunteer
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities when the facility and
 
02:48:36.990 --> 02:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
without our volunteers we would be lost
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
they do so much for us and our veterans
 
02:48:42.030 --> 02:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
and we continue to a mandate of 4 hours
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
per pay period for nursing um to meet
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the minimum
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
requirements our strategic key uh
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
priorities this year or the next two
 
02:48:53.950 --> 02:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
years grow the veterans the veteran
 
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
resident census that is one of our key
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
we want to meet all the need anybody who
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
needs a place with us we want to be able
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
to offer that and uh open the door we
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
want to reduce the number of vacant
 
02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
staff positions we must always meet the
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
VA survey requirements that's how we are
 
02:49:12.429 --> 02:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
paid and that's how we are licensed um
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
Health Life Safety initiatives like the
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
camera system so we can see if someone
 
02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
had a fall did they hit their head what
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
were the circumstances how do we fix
 
02:49:24.429 --> 02:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
that uh vehicle and Equipment upgrades
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
um one of our um veterans had told one
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
um politicians that was walking through
 
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
that he is embarrassed to get in our
 
02:49:36.990 --> 02:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
rust bucket of a bus and so we do have
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh some vehicle upgrades that we're
 
02:49:40.990 --> 02:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
working on uh one of them uh we did get
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
a new bus but our other bus is quite
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
Rusty so we're working on getting those
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
done it infrastructure upgrades like I
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
spoke about uh updating our conference
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
room so families can communicate with
 
02:49:53.309 --> 02:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
their loved ones more easily than trying
 
02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do it on a FaceTime iPad the ongoing
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
Building Maintenance we have some
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
capital budget projects that speak to
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
that our building is aging as most state
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
buildings are and then the Veterans Home
 
02:50:08.229 --> 02:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
Building addition uh we had money set
 
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
aside in 2016 that had been waiting from
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
the state side we committed to a project
 
02:50:16.269 --> 02:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
and the VA has um now come through with
 
02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
those funds so we are 100% designed is
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
completed for a 20 bed private bathroom
 
02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
unit um so that that neighborhood can
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
offer a higher dignity it also will have
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
more bariatric beds on those units so
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
that we can meet the needs as we
 
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
see the executive summary we did
 
02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
discover um with some uh help from our
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
friends at Das that we had not been play
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
paying something called class 42
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
additional French benefits
 
02:50:48.990 --> 02:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
postretirement and so we need to add
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
that to our budget which has uh
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
increased our budget and um pay our fair
 
02:50:57.630 --> 02:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
share so um we did add that into our
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
budget um and these other uh additional
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
fundings uh you will see are based on a
 
02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:05.150 align:start position:0%
fundings uh you will see are based on a
225

02:51:05.150 --> 02:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
225
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
census if we don't hit that number then
 
02:51:10.750 --> 02:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we would lapse that money back
 
02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
um but they're around salary benefits
 
02:51:16.229 --> 02:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
due to step increases food costs um do
 
02:51:19.150 --> 02:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
you do you want me stop oh okay I
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
um techn technical technology upgrades
 
02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
um part-time positions and prescription
 
02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
drugs um to accommodate the increase in
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
the veterans
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
census again I have already said we are
 
02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
250 beds we have 225 for Budget uh we'd
 
02:51:40.110 --> 02:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
like to try to keep that budget um and
 
02:51:43.469 --> 02:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
increase our staff and uh increase our
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
um veteran count I do say here that we
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
have uh 21 applications in process and
 
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
we have 12 um already approved so with
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
134 of veterans today we have 33 waiting
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so we know that we can move up
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly if we had enough staff to
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
do that um and we believe that the
 
02:52:08.190 --> 02:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
Staffing is getting better um because of
 
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
the raises we are seeing more nursing
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
applications which is great um so we had
 
02:52:16.349 --> 02:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
a census goal over the last two years
 
02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
we've increased about 16% to of our
 
02:52:22.229 --> 02:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
census and we want to keep going so that
 
02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
nobody is looking for a bed we lose a
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of veterans um who go to other
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
nursing home settings because the
 
02:52:31.070 --> 02:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
families have a crisis and they need a
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
bed right away and we haven't had that
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
ability to offer that but we're moving
 
02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
in that direction with a three minimum
 
02:52:40.110 --> 02:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
um weight period most families are uh
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
going through the process so we can
 
02:52:42.990 --> 02:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
offer those beds
 
02:52:46.670 --> 02:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
quickly our current census is 134 we
 
02:52:48.830 --> 02:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
have some pending admissions right now
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
to go up to 140 um we have 122 men and
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
12 women and our average AG is about 83
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
years um we have over 30 people right
 
02:53:02.229 --> 02:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
now in our resident uh in our residency
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
with uh overage 90 and we actually have
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
one veteran who will be turning a 100 in
 
02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
January so it's it's been great um this
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
is our median yearly census you can see
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
that it kind of dropped down and we know
 
02:53:17.229 --> 02:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
what caused that in in
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
2021 um and you can see where it's
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
starting to move up and we're hoping to
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
keep going up over the next few
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
years this is our resident uh discharge
 
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
and admissions um so our discharges were
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
um quite they dipped down during covid
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and they're still a little high um
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
but that is to be expected when you have
 
02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
an age an average age of 83 years
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
old uh branch of military I always add
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
this to anything I do because it's
 
02:53:51.070 --> 02:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
always competitive um the Army still is
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
the most representative with 56
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
residents Marines are 10 Navy 38 Air
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
Force 25 National Guard uh two and coast
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
guards three so um army still wins we'll
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
see what happens at the football game um
 
02:54:12.229 --> 02:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
conflict era served we have four w war
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
two veterans and if anybody had a chance
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
to see the union leader on Sunday they
 
02:54:19.870 --> 02:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
did a big u p uh big news about us and
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
our four veterans they highlighted them
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh career conflict we have had we have
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
31 Vietnam is our largest 77 and we
 
02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate that to be growing we do have
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
one Gulf War resident and we have 21
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
that either served during war uh peace
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
time or have not identified uh a time
 
02:54:41.550 --> 02:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
frame when they
 
02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
served is this your snapshot you like
 
02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
Charlie the vacancy
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
snapshot um so this will tell our
 
02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies in our field um and again we
 
02:54:55.630 --> 02:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
still um we still have a need we have 82
 
02:54:57.710 --> 02:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I really focus on LNA and nurses
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
because that those positions can dictate
 
02:55:04.349 --> 02:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
whether our census is higher or lower um
 
02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
food service has a little bit of effect
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
there but you know maintenance is
 
02:55:10.110 --> 02:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance our building is our building
 
02:55:13.710 --> 02:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh so the LNA vacancies are still um I
 
02:55:15.429 --> 02:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to interrupt but I can you
 
02:55:16.670 --> 02:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
can you talk to that because it's
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
something that people people wonder
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
about all the time as we go through like
 
02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
what are your like your census today is
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
capped because of the Staffing yes and
 
02:55:28.349 --> 02:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
how much additional Staffing would get
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
you to a I assume it's steps not yes yes
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
so I think um so we have when we look at
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
units like a small unit that I have is a
 
02:55:41.229 --> 02:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
14 bed unit and to open that unit I need
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
at least three nurses with relief Factor
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I need four and a half nurses and
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
then I need um nine lnas with a relief
 
02:55:52.349 --> 02:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
Factor so when we hit those we can open
 
02:55:54.670 --> 02:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
another unit right now how we're doing
 
02:55:56.710 --> 02:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
our growth is that we have some units
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
that have double beds and we have been
 
02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
keeping them as singles but they have
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
the capability of going above and doing
 
02:56:06.349 --> 02:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
the double rooms and some people benefit
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
from having a roommate you know we have
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
to know our residents and know what
 
02:56:13.870 --> 02:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
their social um ability is and so right
 
02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
now that's why I'm saying we're capping
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
at 140 but we're looking at doing an
 
02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
additional 10 because we can look at
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
those double rooms and that won't impact
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
the staff count so we're trying to be
 
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
really creative with a current staff we
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
have getting that census up because the
 
02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
more the census up the more federal
 
02:56:33.630 --> 02:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
funds we have um so it's this Catch 22
 
02:56:35.830 --> 02:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
where we have to have the censes to have
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
the finances um so each time we can go
 
02:56:41.710 --> 02:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
another step we can have more residents
 
02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:44.510 align:start position:0%
another step we can have more residents
come

02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
in vacancy rate combined our overall um
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
is 36.7 overall some of those are
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
purposefully um I have as an example I
 
02:56:58.950 --> 02:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
have um a nurse practitioner that I have
 
02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
been holding back because at 2:25 we
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
would need two nurse practitioners but
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
at 140 we don't need two we only need
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
one and a half so I've had a half a
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
part-time position added to our 50 align
 
02:57:16.429 --> 02:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
50 money and holding on that full-time
 
02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
which we're saving benefits the same
 
02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
with Recreation you know we have a
 
02:57:23.309 --> 02:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
pretty robust recreational staff but if
 
02:57:26.229 --> 02:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have 225 residents then we can
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
hold back to those recreational
 
02:57:32.110 --> 02:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
positions um until we get to that 225 so
 
02:57:34.030 --> 02:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
the rate is um
 
02:57:36.670 --> 02:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat not clear because some of these
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
are purposeful they're not all um me you
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
know we're not all recruiting however
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
nursing in uh laas we recruit for all
 
02:57:48.229 --> 02:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
the time and I will say two years ago um
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
we had a 49% vacancy rate for nurses and
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
today it's
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
39.7 and we're seeing applications for
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
nurses I'm not sure where they're coming
 
02:57:59.229 --> 02:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
from but we love it and we don't want to
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
stop it so uh we hope they
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
continue we have three sources of
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
revenue that are solely dependent on
 
02:58:09.630 --> 02:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
Resident census the federal revenue is
 
02:58:11.950 --> 02:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
the VA per DM that's given to the home
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis for the number of
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
residents residing at the home the
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
current prdm rate that is called a basic
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
$144 and the higher pum rate which we is
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
called a prevailing rate um is uh
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
$587 prevailing rate uh residents are
 
02:58:35.070 --> 02:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
those who have a 70% or more uh
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
disability rating and because of the
 
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
pact act we're seeing a lot more
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
residents who are qualifying for that
 
02:58:44.750 --> 02:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
prevailing rate right now we had this
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
past month 16 residents that qualified
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
for that higher rate um which helps our
 
02:58:54.830 --> 02:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue the agency Revenue uh is the
 
02:58:57.150 --> 02:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
income coming from room in board some of
 
02:59:00.070 --> 02:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
our residents pay full room and board if
 
02:59:02.429 --> 02:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
they have assets over three 30 uh
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
$330,000 until that asset drops they
 
02:59:07.950 --> 02:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
will pay the full rate which is
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
$349 per day um or
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
$1,444 per month once they get under
 
02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:15.229 align:start position:0%
$1,444 per month once they get under
that

02:59:15.229 --> 02:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:17.429 --> 02:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
$30,000 then they would go down to a
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
partial pay and that is decided with a
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
um long process with the VA of how much
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
they pay so it goes by income the lower
 
02:59:27.750 --> 02:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
their income the less they pay
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
us the general fund dollars are matched
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
with the federal revenue and agency
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
income and as you can see to the side
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
here currently 30% of our uh funds are
 
02:59:40.229 --> 02:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
paid for are we are paid for by uh
 
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds 24% by residents and 46%
 
02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
by General funds that changes as we have
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
more more of a
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
mix this is just a historical of where
 
02:59:57.070 --> 02:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
we spent from fy2 to 24 of actual cost
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
and so we broke this down for from the
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
federal side of what we um accur accured
 
03:00:07.469 --> 03:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
from them and then the resident
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
side again historical where we had
 
03:00:12.190 --> 03:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
expenditures so you can see where we've
 
03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:13.190 align:start position:0%
expenditures so you can see where we've
come

03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
from and I know this isn't the place
 
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
because this is operational budget but
 
03:00:18.790 --> 03:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
we did mention our capital budget
 
03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
requests we have four of them um one is
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
to replace rooftop air handlers um the
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
current ones are over 30 years old we
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
got the the analogy the my operations
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
officer tells me is we got the motor in
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
the transmission changed out this year
 
03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
emergently but the body is rusting all
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
around it which is going to affect the
 
03:00:41.309 --> 03:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
motor in the transmission again so we're
 
03:00:44.229 --> 03:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
trying to replace that motor part uh
 
03:00:47.950 --> 03:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me the vehicle part uh we have a
 
03:00:50.229 --> 03:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
request to replace seven resident tubs
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
in a bariatric shower uh the tubs we are
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
now they're so they're aged so much were
 
03:00:58.670 --> 03:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
taking pieces from the closed units to
 
03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
fix the old tub so it's a crisis at this
 
03:01:05.110 --> 03:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
point um and we replace one elevator and
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
update two as well as bring one of our
 
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
our two units that are the oldest to Ada
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
compliancy some of the rooms we can't
 
03:01:15.389 --> 03:01:15.399 align:start position:0%
have residents go into with certain
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs because they're not wide
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
enough and so we we'd like to work on
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
that um so we've have a high a high TR
 
03:01:26.710 --> 03:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
um trans excuse me tradition of
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
providing high quality care and to be
 
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
coste effective when we can um and so
 
03:01:34.030 --> 03:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
we're hoping with the support of the
 
03:01:36.710 --> 03:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
governor the new governor and this
 
03:01:39.389 --> 03:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
committee that we will continue that
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
tradition I'm open to any
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh just to to
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
summarize your your your current
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
um census is 134 the budget you've
 
03:01:54.429 --> 03:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
submitted would allow you to go up to
 
03:01:58.110 --> 03:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
225 assuming you can find yes sir the
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the nursing staff and other uh
 
03:02:02.830 --> 03:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
employees to fill those
 
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
positions uh if hypothetical question
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
but if if a if a Plane full of nurses
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
and custodial staff and uh Food Service
 
03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
handlers showed up and you were fully
 
03:02:16.269 --> 03:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
staffed is the demand there right now
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
for 225 if we look at our numbers right
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
now today if I could take everybody it
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be 167 and that's without
 
03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
advertising to our veteran service
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
organization partners that we have a
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
short or no weight I do believe that we
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
could easily fill our facility with no
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
short or a small weight be right now
 
03:02:37.750 --> 03:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally most people say if you
 
03:02:39.150 --> 03:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
want to go to the New Hampshire Veterans
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
Home Plan a year uh the process is going
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
to take that long and again as I said
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
most most people need a quicker fix than
 
03:02:49.710 --> 03:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
that we still do do transfers from other
 
03:02:51.469 --> 03:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
nursing homes they've gone to a nursing
 
03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
home and they still want to come to the
 
03:02:56.429 --> 03:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
veterans home um so I think we could we
 
03:02:58.710 --> 03:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
could go up if a plane of nurses come
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
and they want to work for us I think we
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.030 --> 03:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
need thank you very much thank you sir
 
03:03:10.990 --> 03:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the hearing is now in
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
recess and we'll uh regroup again at
 
03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.750 align:start position:0%
recess and we'll uh regroup again at
1:15

03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
p.m.

for fiscal years 2026 and
 
04:18:27.309 --> 04:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
2027 the mission of the Department of
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
Safety is to consistently enhance safety
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
security and the quality of life in New

division each with its own Public Safety
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
mandate and are uniquely
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
funded demand for Public Safety Services
 
04:18:51.389 --> 04:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
continues to grow across all areas as to
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
the demands on our
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce in developing this budget we
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
followed our strategic plans ensuring
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
that our primary goals remain Central
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
While acknowledging the challenges and
 
04:19:05.550 --> 04:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
constraints that lie ahead we set
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
expectations at every level mindful that
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
each division has specific evolving

indicators this message outlines the
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
challenges faced by the department due
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
to high vacancy rates budget constraints
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the need for
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
modernization despite these challenges
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
the team has successfully maintained
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
Services however as operational costs
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
have risen driven by increasing salaries
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
equipment replacement expenses and a
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
greater dependence on it infrastructure
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
some critical positions remain unfunded
 
04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
this is affecting Staffing levels and
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
delaying technology upgrades while
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
online services and system Replacements
 
04:19:53.550 --> 04:19:53.560 align:start position:0%

Safety Services and meet growing demands
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
the department has identified a funding
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirement of 2.1 million for both
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
2027 throughout today's presentation
 
04:20:09.109 --> 04:20:09.119 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss the impact of these
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
priority needs on Public Safety across
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire securing FS for all vacant
 
04:20:15.870 --> 04:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
positions remains a top priority and we
 
04:20:17.870 --> 04:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that resources be
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
allocated accordingly if available
 
04:20:22.830 --> 04:20:22.840 align:start position:0%

04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
the essential Public Safety mission of
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
each of our seven divisions and provide
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
a summary of changes priority needs and
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
impacts on the delivery of services
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions you
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
may have during or at the conclusion of
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
our presentation thank you thank you

commissioner and good afternoon everyone
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
let's dive into the Pres presentation
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
beginning on page two which offers an
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
overview of the Department's
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
organizational structure as the
 
04:20:51.309 --> 04:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner highlighted the department
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
of safety is composed of seven divisions
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
each with distinct functions funding
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
sources this structure makes it logical
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
to present our budget request on a
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
division by division basis which is our
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
approach today before we delve into each
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%

totals the department is largely driven
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
by personnel with 60% of its budget
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated to salaries and benefits while

04:37:55.470 --> 04:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
highlighting areas where additional
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
support is necessary to fulfill
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements this budget
 
04:38:02.189 --> 04:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
sustains essential Public Safety
 
04:38:04.109 --> 04:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
Services for New Hampshire through
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2026 in
 
04:38:09.990 --> 04:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
2027 however several critical positions
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
remain unfunded due to budget
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
limitations Rising salary and benefits
 
04:38:16.349 --> 04:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
increased equipment replacement cost and
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
a growing dependency on it operational
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
costs have also risen due to
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and system requirements
 
04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs funding of 4.2 million
 
04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
is crucial to support Public Safety as
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
our department works to meet the
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
expanding demand for services at all
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
levels any future budget cuts will
 
04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
impact Service delivery and this
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
concludes our budget summary for fiscal
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
year 26 and 27 and we're open to
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
questioning thank
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
you um I have a a question over the last
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
this this really focuses on specifically
 
04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
for for DMV but but I guess it's a it's
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
a broader
 
04:39:00.510 --> 04:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
question uh overall uh in the last year
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
I know I've I've renewed my driver's
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
license my car registration through my
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
town I requested and I requested a title
 
04:39:10.990 --> 04:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
for my car and I believe I did it all on
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
my phone
 
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
have the and it all worked great have
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
these technological changes that have
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
allowed for
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
Simplicity allowed you to reduce costs
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
in other areas whether it be uh through
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs or other areas how has
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
that techn technological changes to make
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
life simpler from the consumer side
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
helped you in in reducing budgets in
 
04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
other areas to make up for the increase
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
so I think the the the simple answer to
 
04:39:47.708 --> 04:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
that is these improvements going online
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
wherever we can have been going on for a
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
couple of years now so what we do is we
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor uh the answer to
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
that is we monitor customer service in
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
every every branch of the DMV whether
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's wait times on calls how long it
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
takes to issue a title there are still
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
things and transactions that have to be
 
04:40:09.628 --> 04:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
done uh by a person so we continue to
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
monitor that but the bu budget that we
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
present today takes into account the
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
services that have been uh put online
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
prior to this and we continue to do this
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
um as we look forward to our uh etitle
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
Ean program so we'll continue to look at
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
whatever efficiencies that we gain on
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
costs hi um
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
um couple things oh I was told to not
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
keep this so close to me I'm too loud
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so is there anything I'm going to ask
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
a two-part question right so so the the
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
budget has some significant increases
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
and and I think your presentation does a
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
really good job of outlining the the
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
impact of all the things you had to cut
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
and would like back so to speak
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything let's say you
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
were let's say the the next Governor
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
looked at the agency draft and went yeah
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay and just kind of went forward with
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
it um um can you think a little bit
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
about if there are anomalies in that
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
that you've noticed since the time of
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
the agency draft where yeah okay
 
04:41:24.190 --> 04:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work and there's something you
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
might want to look at and then the
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
second part of that is have you have you
 
04:41:33.390 --> 04:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
started thinking at all about um uh so
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're cut I'm going to guess it was a
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
4% general fund cut what if in the what
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
if in the governor's phase of the budget
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
um the direction is make
 
04:41:48.910 --> 04:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
four8 and have you have you had internal
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
discussions I'm not asking for you to
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
point out things today but have you had
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
internal discussions about what eight
 
04:41:56.110 --> 04:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
instead of four might look
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
like well not specifically to that
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
number but I mean we are we have worked
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
very closely with the you know the
 
04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
division directors on this and as you
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
know Amy I think stated perfectly this
 
04:42:12.550 --> 04:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
allows us to maintain more Cuts would
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
impact you know customer service and and
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
safety and we would have to have those
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
conversations and look at not be deliv
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
it or I mean when you look at customer
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
service it's it's weight times um so
 
04:42:26.110 --> 04:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
there's customer service on how long it
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
takes to get a registration issued or a
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
title um but uh to get the telephone
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
answered but then on the public safety
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
side having adequate resources out there
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
to meet the demands um for investigating
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
crimes and we would have to um go back
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
and and we would have those
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
conversations and relook at it but we
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
have not specifically looked at what an
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
additional 4% would do okay I just was
 
04:42:54.270 --> 04:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
to I just um second question is about
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
State Police what are your current uh
 
04:43:01.230 --> 04:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
Trooper vacancies because they're pretty
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
high aren't they sure yes yes sir so as
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
of this I think we put 66 in here
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's actually 67 but what I will tell
 
04:43:12.430 --> 04:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
you is um as we prepared this budget we
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
worked on structuring this and being I
 
04:43:18.270 --> 04:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
would say fiscally responsible and
 
04:43:20.030 --> 04:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
understanding what we believe we can
 
04:43:22.590 --> 04:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
hire you know knowing and I believe we
 
04:43:25.628 --> 04:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
plan on potentially 12 per class and you
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
can only absorb so many into the
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
division at one point but what we're
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
looking at we've got 60 67 vacancies
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
today we have 10 that are in the
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
pipeline to be hired we just had a class
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
on November uh a test November 9th and I
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe we have eight
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
that are in the background process now
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
so they are working um as diligently as
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
possible without lowering their
 
04:43:49.628 --> 04:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
standards so you think we might have
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
seen the peak
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
of you know we rely on a lot on Troopers
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
for so many things um do you think we
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
might have seen the peak of the the or
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
the valley I guess of the sure well
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
hiring issues sure it's
 
04:44:05.670 --> 04:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's not my opinion but in speaking to
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
the state police they're seeing more
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
interest in the testing um the quality
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
of candidate
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh is improving and um so we're um
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
optimistic we're optimistic and and if
 
04:44:20.830 --> 04:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
they do the best they can um they
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
generally will look at the numbers are
 
04:44:26.190 --> 04:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent if you know 88 sign up
 
04:44:28.230 --> 04:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
to take a test they know how many may
 
04:44:29.788 --> 04:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
actually show up and out of those how
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
many go to background we'll make it
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
through um so they're pretty consistent
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
when we developed this and we looked at
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
that number 12 we felt consistent that
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
we were going to be and that was the
 
04:44:41.470 --> 04:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
state police worked very hard in that
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
looking at the data and working with uh
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
director Newbery do you do you think
 
04:44:50.110 --> 04:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
there's potential for if we
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
um you know this isn't something we do
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
in every area right but but let's say we
 
04:44:55.750 --> 04:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
ended up UNF funding some number of
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
positions just pick a number um and yet
 
04:45:01.230 --> 04:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
hiring was going
 
04:45:01.240 --> 04:45:02.750 align:start position:0%
hiring was going
well

04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe something we could look at
 
04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
something like putting language in the
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
budget that would allow despite those
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
being unfunded if the recruitment
 
04:45:14.390 --> 04:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
succeeded to a greater extent than we
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
thought possible some sort of mechanism
 
04:45:18.590 --> 04:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
to I don't even know what go to fiscal
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
or something to fill positions right is
 
04:45:22.948 --> 04:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
that something you've experienced in the
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
past no but I think I think filling
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
these positions is is Paramount to
 
04:45:29.190 --> 04:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
Public Safety in New Hampshire so
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
whether you had to delay it as long as
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
there was a solution if we had a good
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
candidate and we had um we had a spot at
 
04:45:38.110 --> 04:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
the police academy and we could get them
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
in there like I said we've done that now
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
in this budget so we've unfunded a
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain number of position we have 66
 
04:45:49.868 --> 04:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
vacancies we unfunded 36 and 26 and 16
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
and 27 that leaves us 30 to higher we
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
also know that we um we lose
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
1.5 per month so over the course of the
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
year we can plan on attrition of have
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
being down 18 due to retirements whatnot
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at the numbers and uh
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
um we can tell you what we anticipate
 
04:46:10.390 --> 04:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
hiring and what we've seen and what we
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
will see so we would we would obviously
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
work with with you and
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and your attrition numbers are fairly
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
consistent they I'll let Amy speak to
 
04:46:23.948 --> 04:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
that because she did she's done a lot of
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
work in
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
this we we have um we're continuing to
 
04:46:31.628 --> 04:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
look at them but we we took like a we
 
04:46:34.510 --> 04:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the last couple of years um
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
particularly um through through kind of
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
the lens of when we were um reviewing
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
the incentives with arpa and
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
um and through recruitment efforts so I
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
anticipate well I'm hopeful that as we
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
as we see as we've seen like this um
 
04:46:56.350 --> 04:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
kind of wave of new folks coming in that
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have that will go down but
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
that is what we've been seeing so we
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
made some assumptions that that will
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
continue but
 
04:47:08.830 --> 04:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
um but of course hopefully that would
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
change but we just went with the what we
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
have been seeing just that yeah just
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
understand if 70 come to take the test
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
so 70 come to take the written and the
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
physical out of those 70 give or take
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
one or two we've got
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
18 that have gone to the next level
 
04:47:31.230 --> 04:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
so oh is that a fairly typical it is it
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
is yeah but we are getting more
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
applicants and like I said that you know
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
speaking to the the colonel and the
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
executive major they're they're
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
optimistic that it's start starting to
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
turn our way and whatever we can do to
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
continue to attract people to come here
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a lot of candidates
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
come from out of state too so um and
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
we're getting yeah that's good because
 
04:47:57.548 --> 04:47:57.558 align:start position:0%
it's such a great place to
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
live I hope that I hope that helped okay
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
yeah just one follow-up question on that
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago when we were talking about
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
it and talking about the unfunded
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
positions uh I I think we realize that
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
the unfunded position especially at the
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
state police and police in general were
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
a national problem that certainly
 
04:48:16.230 --> 04:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
impacted New Hampshire to a significant
 
04:48:18.390 --> 04:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
degree now that we've seen sort of the
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
reverse and we seem people start
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
starting to apply more have you noticed
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
this or have you heard about this also
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
in other states or is this just unique
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire or the Northeast I mean
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
are other states uh similarly seeing an
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
uptick and applications to the police
 
04:48:36.670 --> 04:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
force yeah and I I want to be clear I
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to make it see we're seeing
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
some improvement a slight Improvement
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm not see any overwhelming um
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
influx and I know the you know director
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the police academy is here so he can
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
speak you know to to the entire state
 
04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
but I think there are still significant
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issues in the
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Community uh
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
nationally thank you any other questions
 
04:49:03.390 --> 04:49:03.400 align:start position:0%

have Senator gray uh you listed several
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
changes in legislation have you
 
04:58:32.430 --> 04:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
contacted any legislator to get that
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
done or do you expect those to be in
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh the uh those
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
I can tell you my preference is that
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
that someone you know near and dear to
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
to uh the representative's heart here
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
next to me would be the one that you
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
would contact uh so that it can be
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
considered when they consider House Bill
 
04:58:55.548 --> 04:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
one and
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
two uh thank you Senator gray for that
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
question uh those new programs uh as
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
they came to us uh came to us with some
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh type of support in the way of
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
personnel Andor funding
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the challenges came to us we're still
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of flying the airplane and building
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
it at the same time and at this point we
 
04:59:20.910 --> 04:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate that we would need any
 
04:59:23.310 --> 04:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding other than the
 
04:59:27.510 --> 04:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
request for the um uh the prioritized
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
specialist and if an RSA needs to be
 
04:59:37.470 --> 04:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
changed I would rather not do that in
 
04:59:40.590 --> 04:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 especially if it doesn't
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
directly affect the funding and that is
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
why I would send you to a certain
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
individual or a person of his choosing
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh to assist you in getting that
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
legislation drafted because the time
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
period for drafting legislation
 
04:59:59.708 --> 04:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
especially in the house is very
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
understood my question is in the
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
presentation before US Department of
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
Safety would would would like to hire 60
 
05:00:14.830 --> 05:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
some odd state troopers I'm I'm sure
 
05:00:16.350 --> 05:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from the
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
presentation that follows you that there
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%

are going to want to be hired as well uh
 
05:00:25.708 --> 05:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
so my my question is if Department of
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
Safety Department of Corrections can
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%

sufficient enough to be able to train
 
05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
I I believe that we could do it
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
sir given the numbers that we just
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
presented it'll be tough but but we'll
 
05:00:51.600 --> 05:00:54.628 align:start position:0%
presented it'll be tough but but we'll
do

05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
it I asked this before of somebody have
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
you thought about if the two things it
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
it does sound to me like if the if the
 
05:01:06.190 --> 05:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
incoming Governor says yeah this is good
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
we'll go with
 
05:01:10.548 --> 05:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
it you're not there's nothing weird
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and the second piece is leaving aside
 
05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
whether we should give you
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
$37 for
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
dyt um it just seems like a lot um the
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh if the if things work out the way
 
05:01:29.868 --> 05:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
they look like they might work out and
 
05:01:32.030 --> 05:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
you had to make additional reductions
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
below what you've made have you started
 
05:01:36.990 --> 05:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about that started is all I'm
 
05:01:39.390 --> 05:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
asking yeah I started about uh 10
 
05:01:41.470 --> 05:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
minutes ago when you asked the uh
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner safety no we we actually um
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have discussed that uh and and
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
candidly uh we would have to
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
reexamine uh some of uh the deliverables
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we presently deliver uh and that
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
will impact uh negatively uh training of
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Personnel for the State
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire what's your rough
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
throughput on on training in a in a
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
given year like how many people you I
 
05:02:12.750 --> 05:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't know graduate I think is the right
 
05:02:14.750 --> 05:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
word uh thank you for that question
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner we um we on average will
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
graduate uh about 200 full-time law
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers uh those people are
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
completing a 16-week uh basic uh Academy
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
for full-time
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
certification uh on top of that and and
 
05:02:37.110 --> 05:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
I think these numbers are a little
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that they're accurate
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
historic Ally uh We've we've seen uh
 
05:02:43.470 --> 05:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
some pretty small classes with the
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections although the
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
the sitting class that's getting ready
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
to graduate in a couple of weeks uh we
 
05:02:53.070 --> 05:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
do have uh a pretty good siiz Academy
 
05:02:57.310 --> 05:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
for that Corrections Academy uh we
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
historically would have pretty large
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
part-time acmy as well uh and we are not
 
05:03:08.548 --> 05:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
seeing the numbers at all for um
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
part-time applicants quite
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
frankly um you know I think it's why
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
well I mean guessing I don't yeah no
 
05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great question and I think
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize uh kind of
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
the dynamic that happened about two and
 
05:03:25.948 --> 05:03:25.958 align:start position:0%
a half years ago when police reform hit
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
we uh we we were met with two problems
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh the first problem was the the
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
retention problem there was a lot of
 
05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
people in our business that decided to
 
05:03:36.520 --> 05:03:38.030 align:start position:0%
people in our business that decided to
leave

05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
early uh on top of that we had a
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment problem because people who
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
maybe thought about law enforcement as a
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
career uh decided against it and and
 
05:03:51.548 --> 05:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
because those two things happened at the
 
05:03:55.548 --> 05:03:55.558 align:start position:0%
same time it created a pretty
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
significant uh problem where we had to
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
fill the ranks of people who just
 
05:04:07.470 --> 05:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
left plus the selection pool uh became
 
05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
very shallow and over the the course of
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
the last two two and a half years in an
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure that anybody who we
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
could hire to get them back uh to their
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
their home
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
agency uh through permission of the
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
council we were running overlapping
 
05:04:27.470 --> 05:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
policey much like they do in the
 
05:04:29.548 --> 05:04:29.558 align:start position:0%
military where they'll start a class and
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
then within you know halfway through
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
that session we'll start another class
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
and that was just to try to stay on Pace
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
to get those recruit officers back to
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
their home agency
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
um to uh commissioner Quinn's
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
point I don't know that we're seeing uh
 
05:04:53.470 --> 05:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
a a real steady hard rise in interest in
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement we are seeing a bit
 
05:04:59.070 --> 05:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
of an uptick we've also kind of put out
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
the fire to fill not all but some of
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
those uh people who left early we were
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
able to fill those spots so things are
 
05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
starting to maybe be less urgent when we
 
05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
talk to local and state law enforcement
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
agencies where uh the the the real
 
05:05:24.510 --> 05:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
widespread hemorrhaging has has stopped
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh but we we are still slowly building
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
those ranks while maintaining uh the
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
standards that New Hampshire law
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement holds themselves to right
 
05:05:34.000 --> 05:05:37.708 align:start position:0%
enforcement holds themselves to right
thank

05:05:37.708 --> 05:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.190 --> 05:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
you and I'd like to invite up the
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.310 --> 05:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections good afternoon commissioner
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
everyone my what if asked me that
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
question piles especially commissioner
 
05:06:12.360 --> 05:06:13.350 align:start position:0%
question piles especially commissioner
Arling

05:06:13.350 --> 05:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
Arling
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
house for the record my name is Helen
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
Hanks I'm the commissioner of the
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections it is with
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
great pleasure that I present a budget
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
before this uh hisem uh committee uh
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
that meets the targets as presented I
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
think it is creative uh to meet those
 
05:06:33.548 --> 05:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
targets while also ensuring we continue
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
to make progress in our uh ctional law
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement ranks uh to my right is
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
director of administration for our
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
department Lisa Stone I'm going to start
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
on page one the mission of the
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is to reduce
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
recidivism by providing safe secure and
 
05:06:54.190 --> 05:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
Humane uh supervision and evidence-based
 
05:06:56.190 --> 05:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation to enhance Public Safety
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire you're
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
going to find at the end of this packet
 
05:07:01.868 --> 05:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
we've added additional resources that
 
05:07:03.788 --> 05:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
mission statement is profound in that
 
05:07:06.430 --> 05:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
our goal to reduce recidivism is being
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
achieved starting in 2020 we started Ed
 
05:07:12.430 --> 05:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
to see a marked decrease in the returns
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
to incarceration in 2018 our return rate
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
was as high as 48% in 2020 we've reduced
 
05:07:23.230 --> 05:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
that to 40% and as we continue to look
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
at those released in the first 12 months
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
post relase which is that critical point
 
05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
where we see people return to
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
incarceration in 2020 we saw 291 people
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
return to our care and custody either
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
through parole violations primarily or
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
uh other forms of return um then in 2021
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
we saw
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
256 and then in 2022 we saw 251 those
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
are good Progressive numbers you're also
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to see a road map with regard to
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
the things that we've engaged in on
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Rehabilitation to help
 
05:07:58.030 --> 05:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
build stronger people we are very firm
 
05:08:00.150 --> 05:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
in our charge to be part of the restored
 
05:08:03.548 --> 05:08:03.558 align:start position:0%
justice system we can arrest we can have
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
our Judiciary sentence but if our
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
Correctional Department cannot provide
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
that confinement and rehabilit
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
then our justice system in New Hampshire
 
05:08:12.990 --> 05:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
will not
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
succeed the Department of Corrections
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
was created in July of
 
05:08:19.708 --> 05:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
1983 I've uh listed our statutory
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
charges I will let you read those on
 
05:08:23.788 --> 05:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
your own accord but today we have
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
1,989 individuals incarcerated in our
 
05:08:26.400 --> 05:08:27.470 align:start position:0%
1,989 individuals incarcerated in our
Correctional

05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
Correctional
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
Facilities those on probation and parole
 
05:08:32.110 --> 05:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
468 with regards to supporting victims
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
of felony level crime we support
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
6,300 individuals in impacted by crime
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire felony level
 
05:08:46.390 --> 05:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
crime turning to page two I found it
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
very important to talk about both our
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
challenges and our accomplishments it is
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
important to understand this department
 
05:08:56.670 --> 05:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
as I've testified to before had a very
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
um significant loss of Staff post the
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic and as I've testified and
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to those staff who deserved to
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
retire after a pandemic and the
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments in which we had to operate
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh deserve that retirement so we have
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
spent the last several years making up
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
the difference uh with regard to
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention and bringing
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
on new members to support that Gap and
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement primarily but it
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
affected the other ranks of our agency
 
05:09:24.270 --> 05:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
with that stated prior to the pandemic
 
05:09:25.830 --> 05:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Labor had already
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
forecasted a marked decrease of 7% in
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
the corrections profession across the
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
country and so I as part of the
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
correctional leaders Association have
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
worked with my uh colleagues across the
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
country to both tell people what
 
05:09:40.990 --> 05:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections is and is not and I'll get
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
into some of those strategies a little
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
later in the
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
presentation we have appreciated the
 
05:09:50.590 --> 05:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
support of arpa dollars to incentivize
 
05:09:52.030 --> 05:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
coming on and becoming a correctional
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh member of the State
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire with our $10,000
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
recruitment incentive that has been a
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
motivator for people to choose
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
Correctional law enforcement over other
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
ranks of law enforcement in the state
 
05:10:07.868 --> 05:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
we've um we've really seen a marked gain
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll see some numbers again in the
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
back of the packet associated with that
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh we continue to be challenged with the
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
Aged infrastructure at the Hampshire
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
state prison for men the infrastructure
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a recruitment and retention challenge
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh individuals certainly uh appreciate
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure at the New Hampshire
 
05:10:25.548 --> 05:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
correctional facility for women and even
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
our new Northern New Hampshire
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility is designed and
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
better equipped to support staff as well
 
05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
as those incarcerated
 
05:10:35.470 --> 05:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
there uh We've continued to implement
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
because we're cognizant that working
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh can be a challenge it can
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
result in uh post-traumatic stress
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
disorder and other issues with regard to
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
what you encounter the 24-hour stress
 
05:10:48.030 --> 05:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
and pressure of not knowing what's going
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
to happen when you look into a cell or
 
05:10:52.030 --> 05:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
search cell or things of that matter our
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the South Massachusetts had
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
a recent significant assault on an
 
05:10:58.510 --> 05:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
officer who was stabbed repeatedly um
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
those things happen uh they happen
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
across the country in our neighboring
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
states and and we work every day to
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening in our
 
05:11:07.270 --> 05:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
Correctional environment when we're not
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
naive that it could so so we want to
 
05:11:11.788 --> 05:11:11.798 align:start position:0%
build employee Wellness programs to help
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
continue to develop the resiliency and
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
strength of our
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
staff we've increased the amount of a
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment and I
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
know this is a budget meeting but all of
 
05:11:24.030 --> 05:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
the things that fund these activities
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
are critical in our mission forward uh
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
including for people who return on a
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
parole violation they're directly linked
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
to substance use disorder and return to
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
criminogenic behavior so we have to have
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
multiple paths for people once they're
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
assessed for treatment during our
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
incarceration and right now we had one
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
primary path which was a modified
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
Therapeutic Community but we've created
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
a targeted parole violation program if
 
05:11:48.910 --> 05:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
they assess to that level to participate
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
that and to revive those skills they had
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
previously generally learned through
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
their treatment
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
Service uh critical to keep our
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers in the facilities
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
both for safety reasons but to use their
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
skill set and primary posts our medical
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
forensics team have even implemented
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
colag guard if you're a person of that
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
age I want you to know there's an option
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
to have that experience at home instead
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
of going and having colonoscopy and we
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
in Corrections have finally gotten there
 
05:12:15.150 --> 05:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
into some modern medicine and it is
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
important because it reduces the use of
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
corrections officer and transportation
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
and we can fill those unfilled posts
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
better at the correctional
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
facilities we continue to align our
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
nhdoc formulary to the Medicaid
 
05:12:29.390 --> 05:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
formulary that's both important for
 
05:12:31.230 --> 05:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
affordability and continuity care but
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
also to try to reduce the cost of
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals uh that are charged
 
05:12:37.030 --> 05:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
against the general fund we have been
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
privileged to be granted a waiver from
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
the centers for medicated Medicare
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
Services referred to as an 1115 a waiver
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
that becomes really important because as
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
I uh lean into the budget as we move
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
forward the CMS will fund and pay for a
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
30-day supply of medications at this
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
time the department the general fund
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
pays to for at least 14 days suppli of
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
those medications so we'll be able to
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
defer those costs but as well as
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
increase the continuity of care upon
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
release we've updated our uh Dental
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
operatory Suites I want to thank nht for
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that because they donated to us four
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
Dental operative operative chairs that
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
did not have to come from the general
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
fund and we've been able to install
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
those uh We've collaborated with
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
Partners like White Mountains Community
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
College to really Implement uh the
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
second chance pel Grant and help people
 
05:13:27.830 --> 05:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
again with evidencebased Rehabilitation
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
and education become stronger citizens
 
05:13:31.830 --> 05:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
and more employable and we're also
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
working with nhti to move forward we
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
have uh actively right now 23 students
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
in that program and uh White Mountains
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
is offering a business associates degree
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
and a Lial arts
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
degree we've expanded a choose love
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning program the
 
05:13:49.548 --> 05:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
founder Scarlet Lewis lost her son in
 
05:13:51.948 --> 05:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
the Sandy Hook massacre and said
 
05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
enough's enough we're going to do
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
something about changing the way which
 
05:13:57.708 --> 05:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
people resort to violence and this
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
program helps teach people fundamentals
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
around gratitude and courage and heroic
 
05:14:05.070 --> 05:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
action and compassion fundamental
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
elements that some of us did not have
 
05:14:09.628 --> 05:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
the privilege to understand in our youth
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we need to continue to move people
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
forward to make nonviolent decisions and
 
05:14:15.150 --> 05:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
their actions this has been well
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
received has demonstrated a decrease in
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
violence for those that have
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
participated in our Correctional
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
environments and we've deployed it
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
across the three primary Correctional
 
05:14:26.230 --> 05:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
Facilities we participated in the New
 
05:14:27.868 --> 05:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
England Commission on the future of
 
05:14:29.708 --> 05:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
higher education in prisons and that
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
report has been published and we
 
05:14:33.230 --> 05:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
continue to strive because providing
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
education and Vocational opportunities
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
statistically demonstrated one of the
 
05:14:39.150 --> 05:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
strongest impacts in reducing people's
 
05:14:40.030 --> 05:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
return to
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
incarceration um so we really you're
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to see us finding multiple lines
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
of effort that we want to reduce returns
 
05:14:47.788 --> 05:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
to incarceration because it costs the
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it costs our
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
communities those adverse outcomes of
 
05:14:55.390 --> 05:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
Crime After the passage of Senate Bill
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
376 and I want to thank all the Senate
 
05:14:59.708 --> 05:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
sponsors for that action the corrections
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
education and Vocational Planning Group
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
um was formed and we're starting down
 
05:15:04.830 --> 05:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
that road to continue to advance those
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities around education and
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
post-secondary uh efforts within our
 
05:15:09.868 --> 05:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
Correctional envirment
 
05:15:12.110 --> 05:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
we've implemented several initiatives
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough at our trans
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
transitional housing units including a
 
05:15:18.830 --> 05:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
cell phone program uh sounds uh strange
 
05:15:21.030 --> 05:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
but it's really not it both affords us
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
GPS uh tracking tools for individuals
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
but also acclimates people back to
 
05:15:26.910 --> 05:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
technology it helps to create a
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
connectedness to their provider and
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
tella health and other T resources can
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
happen on that uh telephonic device um
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
and I spoke about the 1115 a waiver that
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
waiver is also going to provide two
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
provider contacts prior to release as
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
well as two peer-to-peer contacts uh
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
nationally the research has demonstrated
 
05:15:48.510 --> 05:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
reinforcing connectivity to health care
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
and your treatment provider and
 
05:15:51.788 --> 05:15:51.798 align:start position:0%
experiencing that provider before you
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
release shows that you're more likely to
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
continue to go to get those Services we
 
05:15:58.350 --> 05:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
know in looking at parole violations in
 
05:15:59.708 --> 05:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire one of the
 
05:16:01.470 --> 05:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
most connected things we can do is to
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
continue the work that is expended
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
through the general fund on helping
 
05:16:06.548 --> 05:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
people engage in treatment continue
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
post- relase and so with that we're also
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
implementing tella Health booths so that
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
Community provider doesn't have to drive
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
to a correctional facility but we can
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
normalize that interaction through tella
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
Health on page four yes finally those
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
numbers are coming surfacing and
 
05:16:23.948 --> 05:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
explains all those challenges and
 
05:16:26.110 --> 05:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
strengths the department has been moving
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
forward uh you'll see that we are
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
primarily a Personnel driven
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
organization and that is the driving
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
cost our prescri prescription drug cost
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
has also been a driver as well as our
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
Medical payments to
 
05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
Providers understanding that we have
 
05:16:44.350 --> 05:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
major initiatives moving forward the
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
1115a waiver will start January 1st of
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
2025 and so with that we're taking a
 
05:16:53.190 --> 05:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
cautionary approach and reducing that
 
05:16:56.110 --> 05:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
line to meet the governor's Target um as
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
well as our prescription drug
 
05:17:01.628 --> 05:17:01.638 align:start position:0%
line uh in addition to uh those are the
 
05:17:02.990 --> 05:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
two primary
 
05:17:06.030 --> 05:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
reductions is uh moving forward and a
 
05:17:07.990 --> 05:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
you can see all these very large numbers
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
05:17:11.948 --> 05:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh moving to page five I really dive
 
05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
into those Personnel lines I want you to
 
05:17:16.030 --> 05:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
know that our current fill rate for all
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
positions is approximately
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
77% we've had a marked decrease
 
05:17:23.470 --> 05:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
specifically uh identifying Corrections
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
Officers in that rank because that is
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
the primary rank of uh that we use
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
across multiple locations it was as high
 
05:17:33.310 --> 05:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
as 50% in January of 2024 it is now
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
dropped to 44% that's an excellent
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
decrease we on the other hand have
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
approximately over 170 corrections
 
05:17:41.868 --> 05:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
officer positions in which we are
 
05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
recruiting and filling and trying to
 
05:17:45.868 --> 05:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
accomplish that uh every day and like to
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
see that continue to go down so with
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
that stated our strategy um with regard
 
05:17:52.110 --> 05:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
to the budget because I don't want to
 
05:17:55.230 --> 05:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
overlook uh the previous page was to
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
change in the way in which we manage U
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
requests for overtime expenditures uh no
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
I do not think we'll only need
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
$2,100 or $2,100 in 2026 and 2027 but to
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
ensure the morale of our staff we really
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
do not want to unfund uh vacant
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
positions we want to continue to recruit
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
it has been an effective strategy and in
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
the absence of filling those positions
 
05:18:21.070 --> 05:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
continue to ask for the footnote to
 
05:18:22.750 --> 05:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
transfer those funds to the overtime
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
line You'll see another ask different
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
this year this banian budget that if
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
that uh initiative is not successful in
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
covering those costs then we would
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
shepher a request to the fiscal
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee for an additional
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation followed by a request and
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
approval through governor and executive
 
05:18:38.400 --> 05:18:42.670 align:start position:0%
approval through governor and executive
councel

05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
on page six is a demonstration of the
 
05:18:48.548 --> 05:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
historical overtime costs and you'll see
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh different in this slide we've
 
05:18:51.788 --> 05:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
actually put the number of hours
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
associated with that overtime cost
 
05:18:57.830 --> 05:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in 2023 versus 2024 the cost
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
of overtime costs more it simply does
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
our agency had been um had a
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
significantly lower starting wage as
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
starting Correctional law enforement
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
ment than any other branch of law
 
05:19:11.708 --> 05:19:11.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement and with the support of the
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislature after the reallocation we're
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
in a much more um Equitable competitive
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
Place uh but in addition to the uh
 
05:19:21.548 --> 05:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
bargaining outcomes of double overtime
 
05:19:24.548 --> 05:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
and the 10% and the 12% overtime costs
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
more uh base wages cost more for all
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
state employees but the primary driver
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
um is lifting that wage and continue to
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
try to fill those vacant
 
05:19:37.708 --> 05:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
positions we've had a lot of uh Staffing
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
strategies all our Corrections Officers
 
05:19:41.548 --> 05:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
when they leave in good standing we ask
 
05:19:43.310 --> 05:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
them to come back and continue to work
 
05:19:45.390 --> 05:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
part-time but knew over the last couple
 
05:19:47.948 --> 05:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
of years for individuals who either
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
physically can't continue to meet the
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement standard in New
 
05:19:53.070 --> 05:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've created a correctional
 
05:19:56.190 --> 05:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
line support position um that we refer
 
05:19:58.548 --> 05:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
to as our pum relief pool and so those
 
05:20:00.548 --> 05:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
individuals can come back and fill
 
05:20:04.150 --> 05:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
non-armed security posts and help ensure
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
that someone doesn't have to get forced
 
05:20:08.230 --> 05:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
that day and this prum relief pool comes
 
05:20:10.628 --> 05:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
out of our part-time uh class line
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
rather than our regular uh Personnel
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
lines of overtime and has been a really
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh wonderful truly relief pool for our
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and getting uh
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives moving forward while
 
05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
continuing to
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
recruit we've also um taken our group
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
two Correctional line personnel and if
 
05:20:29.788 --> 05:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
they want to they can go through the
 
05:20:31.470 --> 05:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections Academy and be dually
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
certified and after their regular
 
05:20:35.670 --> 05:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
full-time Duty post they can choose to
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
pick up overtime posts and some do
 
05:20:40.110 --> 05:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's on a voluntary basis and it works
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
in Reverse as well our certified
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers if they change into
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
a group two Correctional line Personnel
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
position they can maintain their
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
certification under police standards and
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
training councel standards and also work
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
all forms of certified corrections
 
05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
officer posts within our department so
 
05:20:57.628 --> 05:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good supportive
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
interactivity with with the Department
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
of corrections employees and it has been
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
a success for us in addition to all
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
general department of corrections
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
employees once they go through a certain
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
set of training and skill acquisition
 
05:21:11.788 --> 05:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
demonstration they can also work
 
05:21:13.708 --> 05:21:13.718 align:start position:0%
non-armed control room posts and some
 
05:21:15.070 --> 05:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
limited support posts that are
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
transitional housing units as well as
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
when we have somebody in crisis and
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
they're in observation room they can sit
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
on that onetoone post so we've tried to
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
maximize a lot of the skill sets we have
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
in corrections as we teach our staff to
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
participate and be a member of our
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
department um that we're one team and
 
05:21:32.670 --> 05:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to get
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
through this together and we're going to
 
05:21:35.150 --> 05:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
continue to move
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
forward on page seven it's important to
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
show you what we've been doing and
 
05:21:42.270 --> 05:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
trending you'll see the spike in 2022
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
post the pandemic you'll see us starting
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
to make strides in 2023 and continue to
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
do so in 2024 I love it when the dark
 
05:21:53.070 --> 05:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
blue bar is higher than the other two um
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we have right now as of today 27
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
correction officer trainees uh in the
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections Academy and we have between
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
24 and 30 prepared to go to another
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
corrections officer Academy so we're
 
05:22:07.150 --> 05:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
headed in a much uh better Direction
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
than we've ever seen as a department
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
we've uh never had a solid consistent
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
effort on Recruitment and Retention
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
which has been interesting to me in my
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
career and started to Pilot some
 
05:22:19.150 --> 05:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives that I have found to be
 
05:22:21.470 --> 05:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
successful so we now have three
 
05:22:23.150 --> 05:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated Recruitment and Retention
 
05:22:25.470 --> 05:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
sergeants as well as two Recruitment and
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
Retention committees driven by our staff
 
05:22:30.190 --> 05:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
one southern team and one Northern team
 
05:22:33.150 --> 05:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
um it really is important as a as an
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
organization that everyone is involved
 
05:22:38.670 --> 05:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
in the retention of uh each other I like
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
to affirm for my staff I don't work side
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
by side every day with all of you we
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
work side by side with each other and
 
05:22:46.110 --> 05:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
how we interact with one another and how
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
we engag how we think about where we
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
work becomes critically important to
 
05:22:53.548 --> 05:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
retaining staff um so on this page we
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
describe in detail initiatives that
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
we've engaged in including employee
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
development our department has not had a
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
strong employee development meaning
 
05:23:03.310 --> 05:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
leadership program so we've partnered
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
both with uh entities within the State
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
Granite State Police career counseling
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
as well as we've really tapped into
 
05:23:11.548 --> 05:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as our Northeast
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
Correctional leaders Association as
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
Correctional leaders in the Northeast we
 
05:23:17.948 --> 05:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh came together and said why are we
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish all this by
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
ourselves so we've started to
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
regionalize some leadership training
 
05:23:24.788 --> 05:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
specific and Corrections and other forms
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
of training and really trying to
 
05:23:29.070 --> 05:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
maximize the use of all of our um
 
05:23:30.910 --> 05:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
leaders and training and employee
 
05:23:32.548 --> 05:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
development to bring together the
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh Correctional professionals
 
05:23:36.750 --> 05:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
to help the employee development path
 
05:23:39.070 --> 05:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
across the region in in addition to I
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the post- traumatic
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
stress disorder and other things that
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
have been founded in research about
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
those that work in Corrections and I
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
want to thank the governor's Commission
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
on Alcohol and Other Drugs for affording
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
us around $86,000 to contract uh with
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
nami New Hampshire to do work around
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
Crisis Intervention training that has
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
been tailored to the correctional
 
05:23:58.990 --> 05:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
environment talking about trauma and
 
05:24:00.910 --> 05:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
resiliency as well as other mental
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
health topics that are both important to
 
05:24:04.350 --> 05:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
our staff but also to those that we
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
serve and we are trying to um engage in
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
change so that we restore them to
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities most of those
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
1,989 people incarcerated today 90% of
 
05:24:16.868 --> 05:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
them will hit a minimum parole date and
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
will parole to our community we want
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
them to parole successfully and be
 
05:24:22.990 --> 05:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
successful members of our
 
05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
society on page eight I continue to
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the work we're doing around
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
recruiting St strategies we've been to
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
90 Career Fairs 32 classroom talks 33
 
05:24:36.270 --> 05:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
community events and 47 colleges and
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
High School tours we continue to off
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
offer a program at Groveton high school
 
05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
and Berlin High School teaching young
 
05:24:44.830 --> 05:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
people about what being a Corrections
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
professional is for all layers of the
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
organization and these efforts are
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
because we acknowledge that our overtime
 
05:24:53.070 --> 05:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure is a major hit on the
 
05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
general fund budget and we want to
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
resolve that um and continue to make
 
05:24:58.830 --> 05:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
strides to reduce that impact on the
 
05:25:01.150 --> 05:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
state budget we really have a strong
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
social media presence we want to give
 
05:25:04.708 --> 05:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
accolades to the things that we do on
 
05:25:06.510 --> 05:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and we really want to put
 
05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
out the good work that our staff are
 
05:25:08.080 --> 05:25:08.910 align:start position:0%
out the good work that our staff are
doing

05:25:08.910 --> 05:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:25:10.470 --> 05:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
um as individuals in a Corrections
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
Department we went as far as renting a
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
billboard on i93 I did not see any of
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
you apply so I did not continue to renew
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
that billboard um but we still
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
tried um we really have been involved
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
with our communities that our facilities
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
reside in uh working with Berlin PD and
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
having a National Night Out in Berlin um
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
and really want to show that we're
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
community members with that stated the
 
05:25:35.190 --> 05:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
city of conquered has a wonderful
 
05:25:36.910 --> 05:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
holiday parade in the department for the
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
third year uh in a row because last
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
year's was canceled we'll be in that
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
parade I hope to see you there to throw
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
you some
 
05:25:45.868 --> 05:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
candy on page nine the other Major
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
Impact uh our our budget has to the
 
05:25:51.070 --> 05:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
state is our medical service and so here
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see the percentage in the amount
 
05:25:54.990 --> 05:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
that we've allocated for those and as I
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
stated to you uh why we reduce them uh
 
05:26:00.548 --> 05:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly a science but it's an
 
05:26:01.708 --> 05:26:01.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that we're going to see a
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
reduction through the work on the 1115 a
 
05:26:06.310 --> 05:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
waiver we would continue to ask for the
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
footnote we've had in the past which is
 
05:26:10.830 --> 05:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
for uh reasons within the delivery of
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Care both pharmaceutical and
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
medical care that if we did not have
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
enough monies that we would go before
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
State fiscal and then governor and
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
executive Council to continue to provide
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
the constitutionally appropriate care
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
we're required to to
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
deliver what is of an important note and
 
05:26:28.230 --> 05:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
different we did make a purposeful
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
marked decrease of $1.39 million out of
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
our medical budget uh in FY 26 and
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
1.46 in FY 27 that represents contracted
 
05:26:42.548 --> 05:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
money that we uh contract for for the
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
office is referred to as the office of
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
forensic examiners we reduced it not
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
because we don't think the state needs
 
05:26:50.990 --> 05:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
the service but we the Department of
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
Corrections are not charged under the
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
statute which references compeny to
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
deliver that service that has sat with
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
the department since the 1980s when the
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit was transferred
 
05:27:03.070 --> 05:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
under the Department's responsibility
 
05:27:05.310 --> 05:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
and with it came criminal competency
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
evaluations criminal competency
 
05:27:09.230 --> 05:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
evaluations is a pre-sentencing
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication service provided to the
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it is a service that used to
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
be 300 competency evaluations a year
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
that has gone up to almost 890
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
competency evaluations a year and that's
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
not a count of the number of refer
 
05:27:24.910 --> 05:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
referrals but the number of evaluations
 
05:27:27.628 --> 05:27:27.638 align:start position:0%
completed um I would advise that this
 
05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
area of service be considered to be
 
05:27:32.190 --> 05:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
funded either through the Judiciary or
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital that section New
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 135 is entitled New
 
05:27:38.910 --> 05:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and quote insane
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
persons it is not entitled the state
 
05:27:44.350 --> 05:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
prison um so I want to I want to point
 
05:27:45.390 --> 05:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
that out
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
specifically as we continue on on page
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
10 these are the other operational costs
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh each represent U you know more than a
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
million uh in our critical areas of
 
05:27:58.110 --> 05:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
service obviously food and current
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
expense uh we over uh 5,700 meals are
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
serve daily meeting religious and
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
dietary needs I'm not sure how they do
 
05:28:07.708 --> 05:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
it but I do see it and took a picture of
 
05:28:09.390 --> 05:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
it just yesterday morning when I was
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
walking the institutions to ask exactly
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
what we had served that day uh but we do
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
have a full-time dietitian who looks at
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
the meals makes sure they meet dietary
 
05:28:22.350 --> 05:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
Services um and that the quality of the
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
food is such that individuals find it
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
palatable and digestible as we move
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
forward on page 11 uh the utilities um
 
05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
given the history of the department um
 
05:28:35.230 --> 05:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
and also learning the opportunities
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
available we would ask for a continued
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
footnote that if these costs that are
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
not controlled by the department did not
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
meet these targets we could come back
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
and ask for additional Appropriations
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
the N Hampshire state prison for men is
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
far from an economical uh resource when
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
it comes to utilities electricity and
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
water uh so we we just don't want any
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
surprises to the state our office of
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
Information Technology expenses uh these
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
represent the shared costs and work
 
05:29:03.070 --> 05:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
we've been doing uh both to create
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
technological efficiency with a a
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
decreased uh Workforce so things such as
 
05:29:10.590 --> 05:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
as um improving our Fender management
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
system increasing the use of
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
Technologies to do rounds uh We've uh
 
05:29:16.510 --> 05:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
contracted with a partner called
 
05:29:20.830 --> 05:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
Guardian RFID um it it literally is um
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
interesting technology in which we don't
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to do paper rounds to count the
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
individuals it's important to know you
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
have everybody who's supposed to be in
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
your care and custody multiple times
 
05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
today that's uh to assure we don't have
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
any escapes uh but we don't need to
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
continue to do that on paper so we're
 
05:29:37.628 --> 05:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
moving forward with technology as a tool
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
and those are some samples of the
 
05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
resources as well as fusus technology uh
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
which is surveillance technology so we
 
05:29:46.750 --> 05:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
can really see from multiple different
 
05:29:48.070 --> 05:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
areas what is going on in our
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
institution and provide the appropriate
 
05:29:51.548 --> 05:29:51.558 align:start position:0%
visual protections to our staff and
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
those in our care and
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
custody on page 10 uh excuse me 12 these
 
05:29:59.948 --> 05:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
are our additional prioritized needs um
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
I have to pay commissioner Arling housee
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
additional monies for rent so I want to
 
05:30:05.470 --> 05:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that's in the budget but not
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
significantly a lot uh that's literally
 
05:30:11.230 --> 05:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
um and and then office of Information
 
05:30:13.948 --> 05:30:13.958 align:start position:0%
Technology uh are our additional
 
05:30:16.628 --> 05:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs on page 13 is a more
 
05:30:18.670 --> 05:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
detailed demonstration of a high level
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
overview of our budget in FY 26 we
 
05:30:24.750 --> 05:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
reduced it by approximately 4% and then
 
05:30:28.470 --> 05:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
in FY 27 approximately 1.5% with the
 
05:30:30.910 --> 05:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
permission granted that the Personnel uh
 
05:30:34.628 --> 05:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
costs uh that were bargained um equated
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh to a reasonable place for the
 
05:30:38.110 --> 05:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
Department to continue so you'll see
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
some increases both in our class 27 and
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
those are to take over the technology
 
05:30:45.150 --> 05:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
contracts it's about just under half a
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars to create efficiencies
 
05:30:49.670 --> 05:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
for our staff uh in addition to the
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
reductions in both our medical uh and
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical lines as the primary
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
areas in which we've uh reduced so at
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
this time the following Pages again are
 
05:31:02.830 --> 05:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
areas of information uh that you I think
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
are important to talk about the
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
department and I'll let you look at
 
05:31:07.990 --> 05:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
those at your leisure with that happy to
 
05:31:09.868 --> 05:31:09.878 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
questions except for commissioner Arling
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.788 --> 05:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
8% uh commissioner
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
the um the large project we've been
 
05:31:23.948 --> 05:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
talking about for the last few years is
 
05:31:25.750 --> 05:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
is the The Men's prison as you as you
 
05:31:27.670 --> 05:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the current Men's prison
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
is is aging and needs to be replaced uh
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature I believe has a
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate approximately $50 million
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
$10 million through the last budget and
 
05:31:39.788 --> 05:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
then $40 million through the
 
05:31:39.798 --> 05:31:41.470 align:start position:0%
then $40 million through the
session

05:31:41.470 --> 05:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
realistically uh assuming the remaining
 
05:31:45.280 --> 05:31:46.670 align:start position:0%
realistically uh assuming the remaining
funding

05:31:46.670 --> 05:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
comes uh on a on
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
a a scheduled basis or a schedule that
 
05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
that uh you would agree
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
with what are we looking at as far as
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
time and when that prison can come
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
online what's the earliest I mean are we
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
looking at five years 10 years where
 
05:32:05.230 --> 05:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
does it sort of fit thank you for that
 
05:32:06.910 --> 05:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
question that is the question that was
 
05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
asked during the testimony I'd like to
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank Senator gray and other co-sponsors
 
05:32:13.350 --> 05:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
for that $40 million uh to add to the 10
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated before that's a
 
05:32:17.708 --> 05:32:17.718 align:start position:0%
critical foundational uh amount of money
 
05:32:19.548 --> 05:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
so that we can get to bids speec
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
documents to put those out so that the
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire understands
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's $550 million or some other
 
05:32:27.548 --> 05:32:27.558 align:start position:0%
maybe the economy changes and that
 
05:32:29.910 --> 05:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
number goes down um your question about
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
how long will it take is it to move into
 
05:32:34.750 --> 05:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
a fully uh constructed building it is
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 5 and 10 years as I've
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
testified to before
 
05:32:39.910 --> 05:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh we've moved forward on that 10
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
million appropriation we're working on a
 
05:32:45.150 --> 05:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
request for proposal for the $40 million
 
05:32:47.190 --> 05:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
plus we're also working to get that uh
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
bonded and into our budget post the um
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
end of the last uh legislative session
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
so with that stated if we continue a
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
good track and inertia on the getting
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
the information working with those
 
05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
vendors by the time we're building the
 
05:33:04.110 --> 05:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
next budget we should be able to have a
 
05:33:07.150 --> 05:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
number to place there and then move
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
forward with construction and that
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
construction will take anywhere between
 
05:33:13.868 --> 05:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
that moment 5 to 10 years depending on
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
um who we get for construction
 
05:33:18.990 --> 05:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
partner thank
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
you I bet you nickel is closer to
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
10 um I'm being optimistic and cautious
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
at the same time just saying last thing
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
I need is people going why are you so
 
05:33:30.240 --> 05:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
I need is people going why are you so
late

05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
late
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions uh one
 
05:33:37.070 --> 05:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
is just a couple of observations I I
 
05:33:37.080 --> 05:33:38.590 align:start position:0%
is just a couple of observations I I
will

05:33:38.590 --> 05:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
resist asking you if you've already
 
05:33:44.030 --> 05:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
begun discussions at home about reducing
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
this to more like eight than four um or
 
05:33:49.948 --> 05:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
10 um because you've sort of answered
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
that already we we would Mission failure
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
um yes I do understand that uh one of
 
05:33:58.830 --> 05:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
the things I think is going to be
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
helpful for the next Governor's budget
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
team is to know what in the agency
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
budget is problematic in the sense that
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
it was part of an exercise to reach the
 
05:34:14.708 --> 05:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
target M but in looking at it you think
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
ooh that was an issue that might become
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
a problem so you might start thinking
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
about that there only two other things I
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
I want to mention and some some of this
 
05:34:25.310 --> 05:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
goes for almost anybody listening but
 
05:34:27.150 --> 05:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
the one is uh in the past one of the
 
05:34:28.590 --> 05:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
things that we've occasionally done is
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
allowed agencies to go to fiscal if if
 
05:34:33.310 --> 05:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
this or that fall short and they can go
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
to fiscal and ask them for money like
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal is a giant piggy bank and it's
 
05:34:39.670 --> 05:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
worked because for the last eight or 10
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
years fiscal has been a giant piggy bank
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
um with lots of pennies inside their
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
little pig um so to speak um and we're
 
05:34:51.070 --> 05:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
about to enter a time when there are no
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
money there's no money in the pig and uh
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
I I want to say that to agencies with
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
caution because just can because you can
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal doesn't mean they can give
 
05:35:03.708 --> 05:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
you money if they don't have any and I
 
05:35:07.788 --> 05:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
so in the back of our minds um we think
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
about this all the time with like
 
05:35:10.830 --> 05:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
utilities like we don't want to under
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
budget utilities because um um we can't
 
05:35:15.430 --> 05:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
just go get more money if there isn't
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
any so that's one thing out there the
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
second thing is I I think you're very
 
05:35:23.230 --> 05:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
well aware of some of the Oddities the
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
state budget does with how we pay for
 
05:35:28.510 --> 05:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits at Corrections and
 
05:35:30.750 --> 05:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
in past years we have artificially
 
05:35:33.868 --> 05:35:33.878 align:start position:0%
impoverished class 10 MH to allow a
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
multi-million doll hit on the salary and
 
05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
benefit adjustment fund
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
um by transferring the money out to
 
05:35:43.708 --> 05:35:43.718 align:start position:0%
overtime and then paying for that and
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
that ends up accidentally giving you a
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
few million dollars more money um that
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
wasn't budgeted in in that respect and
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's the wrong choice
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
because people had to get paid
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
but we're also entering a time period
 
05:36:00.628 --> 05:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
where if there's not money in the salary
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment fund you can't have it and I
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I I want to I want to hit you with
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
that now because if everyone gets rid of
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
all their
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
vacancies as is likely to happen in the
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
current budget the salary and benefit
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
adjust the salary adjustment fund will
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
have like $8 in it which would be enough
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for the prioritized need for
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
police standards but not much else so
 
05:36:25.590 --> 05:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
those are two cautions just out there
 
05:36:26.910 --> 05:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
well commissioner Hing house I
 
05:36:28.590 --> 05:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that especially the last
 
05:36:30.990 --> 05:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
sentiment as I don't sit on employee
 
05:36:33.390 --> 05:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining and uh through the process
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
the bargained uh raises associated with
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
overtime were and shift iial my agency
 
05:36:40.270 --> 05:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
were not in included in any additional
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation we were not able to absorb
 
05:36:44.788 --> 05:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
those and at one point somebody said to
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
me then just don't provide them so I
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the option of not providing
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
them sure um so I appreciated your
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
support and ensuring that those uh
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
bargained outcomes uh happened within
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
our department no it's good I just I
 
05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
want everyone listening to know that um
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
the runway is narrower than it used to
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
be and uh not everybody always gets that
 
05:37:09.070 --> 05:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
I have have two more legitimate
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
questions for you okay
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
um one is collections yes I um I I I'm
 
05:37:20.190 --> 05:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
looking across agencies to see if there
 
05:37:22.750 --> 05:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
are functions that multiple agencies
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
have that we can find efficiencies for
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
to save multiple people money and I
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
think there are four or five different
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
agencies that have a collections Bureau
 
05:37:33.628 --> 05:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
of some kind within them can you talk to
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
me a little bit about and maybe you
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
don't know this off the top of your head
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't expect you to but collections
 
05:37:41.628 --> 05:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
certainly uh we have a statutory charge
 
05:37:44.990 --> 05:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
to collect uh the court fines
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
restitutions and in addition to if
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
individuals in our care and custody
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
destroy state property and incur
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
Financial Obligations we have a
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
statutory responsibility to collect that
 
05:37:57.270 --> 05:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity uh we collect
 
05:38:00.190 --> 05:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
approximately $2 million through uh
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
roughly five full-time employees who are
 
05:38:04.750 --> 05:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
also funded through their collection
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
efforts uh with that stated there's a
 
05:38:10.430 --> 05:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
approximately over $10 million in fines
 
05:38:12.590 --> 05:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
fees that are left uncollected but this
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
group does the best that they can in
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeking those collection funds by law
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
some of the uncollected is is not
 
05:38:21.310 --> 05:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
because of staffing issues but um
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
ability to pay so the like somebody can
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
pay like 20 bucks a month for like 18
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
years they can exactly so anything like
 
05:38:32.190 --> 05:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
that to individuals who uh walk out and
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
write a check for $118,000 and uh clear
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
their uh just I'll call it justice
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
obligation off the Record would you be
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
interested in exploring maybe through
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
the doj collections Bureau some sort of
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
efficiencies with other agencies I'm
 
05:38:50.468 --> 05:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
always excited about efficiency sir I
 
05:38:51.990 --> 05:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
knew I knew you were I thought that was
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
an easy thing um the other thing is I
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
read your your uh very colorful charts
 
05:38:59.070 --> 05:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
and graphs which I found very
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you um recidivism yes
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't know which page this is it
 
05:39:06.030 --> 05:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
says page two at the bottom but it's
 
05:39:08.110 --> 05:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
about 25 pages in
 
05:39:09.708 --> 05:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
um under Focus
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
unit that particular program well so I'm
 
05:39:16.990 --> 05:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this and res recidivism rates
 
05:39:18.510 --> 05:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
total released
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
1015 and about 380 of them came back
 
05:39:24.270 --> 05:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
which suggests a general recidivism rate
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
of about
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
38% but then the
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
program it's
 
05:39:32.590 --> 05:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
40% so feels like the program isn't
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically successful or are you
 
05:39:37.628 --> 05:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
targeting uh I'm very interested
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
recidivism broadly certainly so in
 
05:39:41.948 --> 05:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
comparing I don't know if you're looking
 
05:39:46.270 --> 05:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
at this slide I'm looking at hang on Yep
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
this slide so that is a very specific
 
05:39:51.150 --> 05:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
targeted review of individuals who are
 
05:39:54.030 --> 05:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
at high risk to return to incarceration
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
who absen this program were coming back
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
at a rate of
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
48% and so through this program we've
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
seen a reduction uh in around their
 
05:40:06.030 --> 05:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder of 40% so if they
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
take the program they're more likely to
 
05:40:10.350 --> 05:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
stay in the community if they do not
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
take the program they're more likely to
 
05:40:14.830 --> 05:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
return and your broad recidivism though
 
05:40:17.830 --> 05:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
is is closer to like 35 38% in that
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
range no I don't know where that number
 
05:40:21.628 --> 05:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
came from but if you look at the road to
 
05:40:23.788 --> 05:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
reducing recidivism you'll actually see
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
it broken down by biological gender um
 
05:40:28.110 --> 05:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be a surprise that
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
females recidivism rate in 2020 went
 
05:40:33.788 --> 05:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
down to 30% when you average the two
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's an overall of 41 and it's even down
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
lower uh now but that number um in
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
comparison to 2018 when the women moved
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire correctional
 
05:40:45.628 --> 05:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
facility for women the infrastructure
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
had a difference in addition to the
 
05:40:47.400 --> 05:40:48.948 align:start position:0%
had a difference in addition to the
rehabilitate

05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
programming oh it went down dramatically
 
05:40:54.590 --> 05:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
dramatically in addition to we uh
 
05:40:56.830 --> 05:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
through the use of State opioid response
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars implemented re-enter care
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
coordinators as I started my testimony
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
and talked about the criticality of the
 
05:41:05.430 --> 05:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
first 12 months during that 12 months
 
05:41:07.310 --> 05:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
that re-entry care coordinator
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily worked with individuals with
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder and Other Drug uh
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
use disorders to help in a barrier
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
removal navigation system and it showed
 
05:41:19.510 --> 05:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh a decline in their return to
 
05:41:21.628 --> 05:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
incarceration so the governor in his
 
05:41:23.590 --> 05:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
last uh budget and the legislature
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
supported transitioning those from Grant
 
05:41:28.350 --> 05:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to State uh employees and it
 
05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
continues to have strong affectedness
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
with those with substance use disorder
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
and it it looks like um total population
 
05:41:38.350 --> 05:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
of the I'm going to focus on on men cuz
 
05:41:40.830 --> 05:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
um it looks like mostly men get locked
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
up um I don't know what that says about
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
us um the um dramatic reductions uh 26%
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the last seven or eight years and and
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
like 100 before that and I imagine that
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
goes back to I don't know when we peaked
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
and started coming down but we've been
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
coming down a lot why yeah we peaked in
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
2010 and 2011 somewhere around 2,700
 
05:42:06.670 --> 05:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
individuals were incarcerated The Marked
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
decline in incarceration is State
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
judiciary's implementation of specialty
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
courts and I'm really glad you brought
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
that question up so as those came online
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we increased the use of drug courts
 
05:42:19.830 --> 05:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
across the state and now we're seeing a
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
marked increase in mental health courts
 
05:42:24.110 --> 05:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
we started to see more diversion to the
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
use of probation rather than
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
incarceration and we started to see more
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
successes even for those on parole who
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
are in drug court um the legislature
 
05:42:34.708 --> 05:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
passed a veterans court bill but was
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
passed without additional probation of
 
05:42:38.670 --> 05:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
pro law for to participate in that piece
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
of legislation and the Judiciary is
 
05:42:42.510 --> 05:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
working through a mental health court
 
05:42:44.590 --> 05:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
Grant expansion and we don't have
 
05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
additional provation parole officers to
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
provide that resource so what this shows
 
05:42:52.590 --> 05:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
is diversional courts make a difference
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh and also in addition to this layering
 
05:42:57.430 --> 05:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the doorway and
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
other uh no no uh other is um excuse me
 
05:43:03.310 --> 05:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
treatment expansion in our New Hampshire
 
05:43:06.030 --> 05:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
communities uh as if there's no bad door
 
05:43:07.468 --> 05:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
to walk through for treatment in our
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
state that all has made a marked uh
 
05:43:11.468 --> 05:43:11.478 align:start position:0%
difference for people's sustainability
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire communities do do you
 
05:43:16.468 --> 05:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
think you'll see that continue if the
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the doorways and and
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
the Hub and spoke model continue and the
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
diversion courts continue I would expect
 
05:43:26.310 --> 05:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
this to either stabilize at the number
 
05:43:28.590 --> 05:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
it is now but I say that cautiously
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
because any change in sentencing law
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
that would increase uh terms of
 
05:43:34.948 --> 05:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
incarceration will uh get us closer to
 
05:43:38.350 --> 05:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
what we were experiencing 2010
 
05:43:40.350 --> 05:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're aware of models
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
across the country I imagine you talk to
 
05:43:46.350 --> 05:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
people in other states um that ought to
 
05:43:49.628 --> 05:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
be brought to the in the attention of um
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
budget writers it would be good to know
 
05:43:54.548 --> 05:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
I I just say that because
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
um prison reform is probably the biggest
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
budget thing that you could do rather
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
than finding pennies here and there it's
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
true and again with the legislature's
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
support of things like earn time credit
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
during incarceration and learning from
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
those opportunities we could look at
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
similar actions uh for people on
 
05:44:15.628 --> 05:44:15.638 align:start position:0%
probation to reduce uh terms of
 
05:44:18.150 --> 05:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
probation when people are complying um
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
and again last uh last session or the
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
session before the legislature supported
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh an adjustment and a reduction of
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
Maximum uh law which affords a more
 
05:44:30.350 --> 05:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
framed opportunity for probation parle
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
officers to understand the
 
05:44:35.830 --> 05:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislator's path for considering before
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
the Adult Parole Board of who the right
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
person is to consider uh taking off that
 
05:44:42.150 --> 05:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
case load so as we look at trying not to
 
05:44:43.628 --> 05:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
incarcerate people we also need to take
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
a measured look at how long should
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
somebody be on Supervision in the
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
community and really use those resources
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
to maximize high-risk
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
individuals okay thanks I'll shut up
 
05:44:55.548 --> 05:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much for your
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you everyone have a
 
05:44:57.280 --> 05:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you everyone have a
wonderful

05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.070 --> 05:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
day like to call up the Adell parole
 
05:45:36.670 --> 05:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.680 --> 05:45:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
got

05:45:38.110 --> 05:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
got
 
05:45:40.110 --> 05:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is uh Roger
 
05:45:41.788 --> 05:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
Phillips and I'm chairperson of the
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
adult Pro board um and with me today is
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
Jay Mackey who's a director of
 
05:45:52.990 --> 05:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
programming um we
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm getting a a little bit horse and
 
05:45:58.030 --> 05:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit laryngitis I presided at
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
meetings all all morning long including
 
05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
two uh contested hearings so we're going
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
to U Jay and I prepared our that page
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
and a half narrative together uh and he
 
05:46:15.788 --> 05:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
um outline U what the pro because we
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
have a a rather small budget as compared
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
to the Department of of corrections but
 
05:46:29.948 --> 05:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
a very substantial function in paring
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
people who does deserve parole and for
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
those who violate the law for the terms
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
of parole uh who are brought back u u in
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
for some period of time so I'll turn it
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
over to J Macky and we'll begin our
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
presentation good
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon the Hampshire Adel parole
 
05:46:54.670 --> 05:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
board is comprised of five board members
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
being the chairperson vice chairperson
 
05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
and three board members currently there
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
are six office staff that provide
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
support for the pro board with me
 
05:47:04.430 --> 05:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
included we are a small agency that is
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the New
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections for
 
05:47:10.030 --> 05:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
budgeting and clerical support uh by
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
Statute in order to meet the target
 
05:47:13.830 --> 05:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
number for this budget we had to cut a
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
full-time support uh office staff
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
position um we are planning to request
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
for this position to be reinstated and
 
05:47:21.628 --> 05:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
funded in house bill
 
05:47:25.150 --> 05:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
to uh in pages one and two of the
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
handout we do have copies of our
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
organizational chart the current one
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
right here uh is page one and the

was audited in
 
05:47:41.708 --> 05:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
2019 there were many areas that needed
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
Improvement the audit described the
 
05:47:45.468 --> 05:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
parole board office as being staff by
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%

to effectively manage their rapidly

increasing workload due to the audit
 
05:47:54.350 --> 05:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations a new position in 2020
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
was approved to be added to the proboard

audit
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations another area in need of
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
improvement was the amount of
 
05:48:08.670 --> 05:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
information provided to the parole board
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
hearing panel the audit found that many
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
of these parole packets submitted to the
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%

the Department of Corrections to provide
 
05:48:20.430 --> 05:48:20.440 align:start position:0%

05:48:25.390 --> 05:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
the size of a parole packet would range

from 30 to 50 pages the most recent
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%

to continue to provide the hearing panel

full-time offic position we have also
 
05:49:03.030 --> 05:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
decreased our request in the areas of

05:49:09.628 --> 05:49:09.638 align:start position:0%

interpreter Services out of state travel
 
05:49:11.878 --> 05:49:12.788 align:start position:0%

Telecommunications the increase in
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
interpretor Services is due to us
 
05:49:17.548 --> 05:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
already exceeding the budget the
 
05:49:19.030 --> 05:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount in the current fiscal
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
year um we're probably going to at least
 
05:49:25.310 --> 05:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
double it um for for this year's this
 
05:49:25.320 --> 05:49:26.468 align:start position:0%
double it um for for this year's this
fiscal

05:49:26.468 --> 05:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
year the slight increase in
 
05:49:30.190 --> 05:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
telecommunications is to meet the
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
expected cost of replacing or expanding
 
05:49:34.030 --> 05:49:34.040 align:start position:0%

currently
 
05:49:37.868 --> 05:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
has we are requested an increase in the

OU of State travel budget from $4,000 to
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
$10,000 another recommendation from the
 
05:49:45.150 --> 05:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
2019 audit was for the P Board to
 
05:49:47.070 --> 05:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
implement a weighted decision-making
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
process for PE
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
hearings board is currently in the
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
process of of adopting the structured
 
05:49:55.868 --> 05:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
decision-making framework model sdmf is
 
05:49:57.948 --> 05:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
called this model was originally adopted
 
05:49:59.628 --> 05:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
by the pro Board of Canada and has since
 
05:50:01.548 --> 05:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
been implemented in approximately 14
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
States an article describing this model
 
05:50:05.310 --> 05:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
is in the handh out provided beginning
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
05:50:10.110 --> 05:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
which is the one from parole board
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
Canada two of our board members and the
 
05:50:13.868 --> 05:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
chairperson have received initial
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
training in this model in order to fully
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
implement it we need to have the ability
 
05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
to receive the training from the
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Corrections and we
 
05:50:23.830 --> 05:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate required traveling out of
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
state the New Hampshire Del parole board
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%

provided by APA the information received
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
in these conferences is
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
invaluable we are very small agency and
 
05:50:43.868 --> 05:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
have the ability to interact with
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
agencies both inside and outside the
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
United States to learn the
 
05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approaches and best
 
05:50:51.310 --> 05:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
practices they utilize is extremely
 
05:50:53.430 --> 05:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
helpful agendas from the last three
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
annual conferences are provided in the
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
handout and it just goes to show that
 
05:51:00.190 --> 05:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
the different topics that are
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussed uh amongst uh all the three
 
05:51:05.190 --> 05:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
days three and a half days that we're
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
there we have executive meetings with
 
05:51:09.948 --> 05:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
just chairpersons and directors um also
 
05:51:11.948 --> 05:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
creating a network of communication
 
05:51:14.270 --> 05:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
amongst the states that we can reach out
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
to people whenever we have an issue that
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't uh encountered yet to to see
 
05:51:21.390 --> 05:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
about what what type of you know
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
decision making that they they've been
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.990 --> 05:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
situations the increase in the request
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%

model as well as attend the ual training
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
conferences provided by apai this will
 
05:51:41.110 --> 05:51:41.120 align:start position:0%

handouts beginning in page 22 we have uh
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
put together some of our own statistics
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we

hearings we are conducting our own
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
recidivism study um being I I did come
 
05:52:25.548 --> 05:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Corrections and I
 
05:52:26.910 --> 05:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
am very

um well learned in their offender
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
management system and I know a lot of
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
the um drawbacks of it which there's a
 
05:52:37.830 --> 05:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
new system version coming out
 
05:52:40.350 --> 05:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
in in the spring which should actually
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
alleviate alleviate most of these issues
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we do have um but with this
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
we've we are tracking the people that
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
have all the people that have been

the year 2022 the calendar year and with
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
this we've come to the conclusion as of
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
right now as of September 9th 2024 is
 
05:53:02.788 --> 05:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
about a 39% recidivism
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
rate which was about 34% in the first 12
 
05:53:06.000 --> 05:53:07.750 align:start position:0%
rate which was about 34% in the first 12

currently over the past eight or nine
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
months we're at about a 75% rate um I
 
05:53:29.310 --> 05:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
see fiscal year 2024 we're at

72%
 
05:53:35.910 --> 05:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
um early on you will see 75 to 77% and
 
05:53:38.190 --> 05:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
that was before before the audit once
 
05:53:39.468 --> 05:53:39.478 align:start position:0%
the audit happened you're looking at
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
2019 2020
 
05:53:46.468 --> 05:53:46.478 align:start position:0%
2021 the approval rate dipped due to all
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
the changes being
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
made uh the pro board had to make in
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
their decision-making processes so a lot
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
less people were being approved now that
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
these changes have been
 
05:54:00.310 --> 05:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
in uh have been made and are in
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
process the PE the approval rate is
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
climbing back up as these people are
 
05:54:05.868 --> 05:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
preparing to go in front of their parole
 
05:54:07.948 --> 05:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
hearings as the doc staff are preparing
 
05:54:09.628 --> 05:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
them and making sure they're doing
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
everything that they know the parole
 
05:54:14.910 --> 05:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
board requires of them to be
 
05:54:20.230 --> 05:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions uh the the only thing I would
 
05:54:24.990 --> 05:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
I I I appreciate you and and thank you
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
for bringing us uh for the reinstatement
 
05:54:29.750 --> 05:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that funded position through hb2 how
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
how this will most likely work is that
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh it now that it's been brought to our
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
attention the incoming governor will
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
decide to include it in her budget or
 
05:54:40.350 --> 05:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
not if if she does it'll be in the
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
operating budget in her operating budget
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh it would not be an hb2 item but it
 
05:54:45.868 --> 05:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
would just be placed directly into the
 
05:54:48.150 --> 05:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
operating budget so so that's how it
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
would work uh I don't have any other
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
questions on that can I ask about
 
05:54:54.310 --> 05:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
recidivism again or are people sick of
 
05:54:54.320 --> 05:54:56.948 align:start position:0%
recidivism again or are people sick of
it

05:54:56.948 --> 05:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
um uh your stud's is interesting you
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
have 402 people released to parole I
 
05:55:03.750 --> 05:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
presume that
 
05:55:06.150 --> 05:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
um not knowing as much about corrections
 
05:55:07.948 --> 05:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
as as I should cuz I refused every
 
05:55:11.190 --> 05:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
invitation from Helen to velcro me to
 
05:55:15.310 --> 05:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
somebody um which just seemed abusive um
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
the 400 are released to parole there's a
 
05:55:21.110 --> 05:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
subset that are released not to parole
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
so this this group of people were being
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
released to parole for the first time
 
05:55:26.708 --> 05:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
from their sentence this does not
 
05:55:28.708 --> 05:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
include people that were brought back on
 
05:55:30.468 --> 05:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
a parole revocation and then released
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
back onto parole oh and there are also
 
05:55:34.590 --> 05:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
other people that are released that
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
complete their sentence Max their
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
sentence out do you think the the
 
05:55:40.110 --> 05:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
recidivism numbers for those three
 
05:55:42.390 --> 05:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
subgroups are different I imagine they
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
would be yes and I know the the docc has
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
done recidivism studies over the years
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
that include all all those different
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
subsets um unfortunately being the small
 
05:55:54.750 --> 05:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
agency we are we it's just trying to
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
track our our trying to see if our
 
05:55:59.310 --> 05:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
numbers do actually match with the doc's
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
and just for our own as we're looking
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
for evidence-based practices you know
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
and and all that that we have you know
 
05:56:10.190 --> 05:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers and what we're looking to
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
achieve do you look at the numbers and
 
05:56:14.110 --> 05:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
think I'm releasing too many people or
 
05:56:17.788 --> 05:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
too few people or we really no we really
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
take each case on a case-by Case
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
basis I guess that makes sense right
 
05:56:26.230 --> 05:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I've looked I've looked at the
 
05:56:27.628 --> 05:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
the numbers and the trends over the last
 
05:56:28.910 --> 05:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
few years I've been in this position for
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
about three and a half years now I was
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
formerly the administrator of
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
classifications for the doc um so I I I
 
05:56:36.910 --> 05:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the number numbers Co
 
05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
obviously had a huge hit to the amount
 
05:56:40.910 --> 05:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
of inmates we had which the commissioner
 
05:56:43.230 --> 05:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
was speaking about all the diversionary
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
courts and how those were used a lot
 
05:56:50.468 --> 05:56:50.478 align:start position:0%
more during covid um a lot of sentences
 
05:56:52.030 --> 05:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
were being suspended as because they
 
05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
weren't bringing inmates into the prison
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
they lost about 500 5 to 600 inmates
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
between 2019 and 2020 um those numbers
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
have not climbed back up there was a
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of an increase yearly by
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
about 50 or 20 intake wise um but they
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers have not come back up and
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't foresee them going back to the
 
05:57:16.270 --> 05:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
way they were just based off of as she
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
talked about the actual success that
 
05:57:19.948 --> 05:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
they're having with these diversionary
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
programs do you think that we I don't
 
05:57:25.390 --> 05:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
know what the right verb is rid um more
 
05:57:27.548 --> 05:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
than average uh compared to other states
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
or are we sort of in the range I believe
 
05:57:31.788 --> 05:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
we're right right around the middle
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
there there are some states lower some
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
states significantly higher I I want to
 
05:57:38.830 --> 05:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
say between and 50 is uh we were in the
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
50% range a few years back and it's it's
 
05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
dipped down and I know I I I met with
 
05:57:45.548 --> 05:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
the public information officer we talked
 
05:57:47.110 --> 05:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
about numbers during one of our other
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and it they were they were
 
05:57:50.430 --> 05:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
their numbers were pretty similar to
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
mine as well so right around the 40%
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
Mark or a little less and it's important
 
05:57:56.350 --> 05:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
to understand that states differ a great
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
deal in their sentencing structure I
 
05:58:01.548 --> 05:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
mean we have indeterminate sentences
 
05:58:05.830 --> 05:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
some just have a a single sentence that
 
05:58:05.840 --> 05:58:06.990 align:start position:0%
some just have a a single sentence that
they're

05:58:06.990 --> 05:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:58:11.910 --> 05:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
they they're they have to go away for 10
 
05:58:14.230 --> 05:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
years oh like if I get convicted of X I
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
do three years right okay and and but
 
05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
before that time they could become
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for Perl there are some states
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
that have no programming Behind the
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
Walls um I I think seems like that's a
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
mistake New Hampshire is really when I
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
speak the other other parole chairs from
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
other states um um um Plus presently uh
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
surprised at at how well we do with
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are offered so that people
 
05:58:46.830 --> 05:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
can be rehabilitated and and safely put
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
back into the
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
community cool okay thank
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%

average um because I figure you're all
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
bored by now um I'm going to talk to you
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what the Department
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services is broadly
 
06:01:11.150 --> 06:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
speaking um and then we can ask
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions about anything else I'm going
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
to start with the second slide because
 
06:01:16.990 --> 06:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
the first slide is a title page and it
 
06:01:19.390 --> 06:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
is boring um so the second slide let me
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
stick with that how do we spend I I want
 
06:01:24.190 --> 06:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
you I want to explain to you that our
 
06:01:26.990 --> 06:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
department is both it's a department and
 
06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's retire health so think of it as two
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
budgets retiree health is a benefit
 
06:01:34.430 --> 06:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
program is is part of the state benefits
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
that certain retirees have Healthcare
 
06:01:38.990 --> 06:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
provided for them it is a separate thing
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's not part of an operational piece of
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
a program if you want me to find
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that's a separate separate
 
06:01:48.190 --> 06:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
thing entirely almost like a separate
 
06:01:49.948 --> 06:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
Department um although obviously it
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
isn't because we administer it um and as
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
you can see from our from our budget 71
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
million of our budget in fiscal 25 going
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
down to 66 is retire Health everything
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
else that we
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
do um actually goes from 90 down to 78
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
um to give you a sense why did reti
 
06:02:10.430 --> 06:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
Health decline I will tell you this that
 
06:02:12.430 --> 06:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
we recently went to a Medicare Advantage
 
06:02:15.868 --> 06:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
program for both the prescription side
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
and the medical side and there are
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings associated with
 
06:02:24.030 --> 06:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
that and um our staff in that Arena led
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
by Joyce Pitman the director of risk and
 
06:02:27.910 --> 06:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
benefits and her predecessor who's now
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner but we won't say her
 
06:02:31.788 --> 06:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
name um have done a real good job over
 
06:02:33.788 --> 06:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
the years of managing that program and
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
doing a good thing but everything else
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
you can see where everything else is and
 
06:02:39.628 --> 06:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
did we hit our Target indeed we did um
 
06:02:40.990 --> 06:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
because it'd be kind of weird if we
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
didn't um secondly I'm going to talk to
 
06:02:47.030 --> 06:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
you about where we spend and hierarchy
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
is the wrong word for expenses but this
 
06:02:51.070 --> 06:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
is by rank order of the large
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
things one of the reasons our budget was
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
big in fiscal 24 is we bought a building
 
06:02:58.270 --> 06:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
for $21 million we're not going to do
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
that again this year we bought enough
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
buildings so um that goes from 21
 
06:03:05.110 --> 06:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
million to zero so savings right there
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
but you can see salaries went up and and
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's largely a function of the of the
 
06:03:11.708 --> 06:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
10% and all of that benefits are going
 
06:03:13.868 --> 06:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
up cuz raise your hand if you think
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
healthcare is getting cheaper um
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
thankful to see no hands um utilities
 
06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
are a significant expense with the
 
06:03:22.110 --> 06:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
number of buildings that we maintain and
 
06:03:23.708 --> 06:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you how many that is in just a
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
short while we do a lot of Maintenance
 
06:03:28.390 --> 06:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
as you can see a huge portion of our
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget if reti health is half our budget
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
half of everything else is plant and
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
property that is taking care of building
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
Etc which is a fairly expensive
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposition um dyt transfers is there
 
06:03:43.390 --> 06:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
proper and Casualty Insurance is
 
06:03:44.670 --> 06:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
something that something that we do
 
06:03:47.788 --> 06:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
directly and other operating expenses
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to move you ahead quickly
 
06:03:51.750 --> 06:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
to page four where we talk about where
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
the general funds are by
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
division and we have we have eight major
 
06:03:57.788 --> 06:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
divisions if you count the
 
06:04:01.030 --> 06:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office as one and I do um
 
06:04:02.190 --> 06:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
because it includes the state budget
 
06:04:04.510 --> 06:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
office for example but you can see where
 
06:04:06.910 --> 06:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
the where the general fund portion is in
 
06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of these areas uh the plant and
 
06:04:11.190 --> 06:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
property general fund expense was 26
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
million going down to six not cuz Karen
 
06:04:16.230 --> 06:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
is particularly efficient at saving
 
06:04:17.468 --> 06:04:17.478 align:start position:0%
money because we're not buying a
 
06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
building again so although to be fair
 
06:04:21.270 --> 06:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's her decision not to buy a building
 
06:04:23.230 --> 06:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should give her credit for
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
that um but you can see where the you
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
can see where the rest of our expenses
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
are and risk and benefits is listed here
 
06:04:33.788 --> 06:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
absent retiree Health cuz the the it's a
 
06:04:35.468 --> 06:04:35.478 align:start position:0%
it's a small program and and a lot of
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
the is the property side of the equation
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
um so you can see where we are and how
 
06:04:44.350 --> 06:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
we're down down 4% 4.02 and then up a
 
06:04:45.708 --> 06:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
bit in the second year like everybody
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
else with um that's because of uh
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits and the seconde
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
cost of those which the governor
 
06:04:54.708 --> 06:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
graciously let us figure into the
 
06:04:54.718 --> 06:04:56.708 align:start position:0%
graciously let us figure into the
budget

06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:05:00.190 --> 06:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
um chart five is nine boxes to remind
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
you mostly of U The Brady Bunch or
 
06:05:04.830 --> 06:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hollywood Squares before we talk about
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
which in each one of those boxes and
 
06:05:10.350 --> 06:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
I'll warn you when I get the poll in
 
06:05:12.190 --> 06:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to start with the
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office what do we do in
 
06:05:15.468 --> 06:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office well as many
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
of you know the origins of the agency
 
06:05:19.830 --> 06:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
were in establishing the office of the
 
06:05:21.310 --> 06:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
com controller in
 
06:05:23.910 --> 06:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
1931 um and and at one point we had a
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
division called the division of budget
 
06:05:27.310 --> 06:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
and control and that's to make sure the
 
06:05:29.110 --> 06:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
budget is controlled that there are
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
controls on the budget that we track the
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget that we that we make sure
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
something's going on at the budget that
 
06:05:36.468 --> 06:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
we have a budget
 
06:05:38.190 --> 06:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
oddly before that we didn't necessarily
 
06:05:39.708 --> 06:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
have a budget people would kind of spend
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
whatever they wanted and like nine
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
months in call you guys up and say on
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative side and say hey we ran
 
06:05:48.270 --> 06:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
out can we have some more people thought
 
06:05:50.070 --> 06:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we should have a Control Function
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
so the Control Function helps ensure
 
06:05:54.510 --> 06:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
that what we spend matches what you
 
06:05:56.430 --> 06:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
approve and that if you don't approve it
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to spend it um in
 
06:05:58.920 --> 06:05:59.910 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to spend it um in
fact

06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:06:02.110 --> 06:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
technically if you spend more money than
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
you've been approved to spend it is the
 
06:06:06.670 --> 06:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
personal Li ability of the commissioner
 
06:06:09.230 --> 06:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
of that agency to make restitution to
 
06:06:10.990 --> 06:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
the state for the amount that was
 
06:06:13.468 --> 06:06:13.478 align:start position:0%
overspent um given the size of my
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
personal bank account we try to make
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
happen um we have a business office
 
06:06:20.310 --> 06:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
think of it as a Central Finance office
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
to manage the various things we do um
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
the office of Cost Containment which
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
people don't think about too much but is
 
06:06:28.750 --> 06:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
where we collect for Indigent Indigent
 
06:06:30.910 --> 06:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
defense hence my question to
 
06:06:33.070 --> 06:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks about collections we
 
06:06:34.628 --> 06:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
have a legal office we have a couple of
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
people inside
 
06:06:38.030 --> 06:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
um technically within the commissioner's
 
06:06:39.430 --> 06:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
office we pay for the Deferred
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
Compensation commission's administrator
 
06:06:44.270 --> 06:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
or executive director although they are
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
independent of the agency um and there's
 
06:06:48.628 --> 06:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
discussion with the governor right now
 
06:06:50.708 --> 06:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
about exactly how they are to be
 
06:06:52.750 --> 06:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
independent of the agency then a couple
 
06:06:54.548 --> 06:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
of assorted special dispersements
 
06:06:56.750 --> 06:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
including the governor's transition fund
 
06:06:58.230 --> 06:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
which I wish I could have been able to
 
06:07:01.868 --> 06:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
say when governor elect aot were here um
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
but there are other things we do a we do
 
06:07:07.350 --> 06:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
a uh a property tax like payment to
 
06:07:10.990 --> 06:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
conquered fire um although it's a
 
06:07:12.670 --> 06:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
relatively pathetic amount so it's not
 
06:07:14.670 --> 06:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
really like property taxes but it's a
 
06:07:17.310 --> 06:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
small amount of money um and we pay for
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
parking cards for downtown employees who
 
06:07:21.868 --> 06:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
don't have parking because that way as
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is if you take a job with me it's
 
06:07:26.110 --> 06:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
like taking a pay cut because suddenly
 
06:07:28.628 --> 06:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
you have to pay thousands of dollars a
 
06:07:30.788 --> 06:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
year for parking and we don't like that
 
06:07:32.110 --> 06:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
so what do we do what are the major
 
06:07:34.110 --> 06:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
areas at the state that that we run as
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
an agency we we run
 
06:07:40.110 --> 06:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
um there I always say in interviews um
 
06:07:42.070 --> 06:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are eight major divisions in the
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
in administrative services that run an
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
enormous spectrum of things one of them
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
I count as the state budget office which
 
06:07:52.230 --> 06:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
is Michelle um and her team some of some
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
of whom you see floating about here and
 
06:07:56.830 --> 06:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
there um one of them is the division of
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
accounting services the state com
 
06:08:00.430 --> 06:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
controller and some states as an elected
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
official here here it's a it's a
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
division head in our agency anybody
 
06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
who's on fiscal has seen Dana call
 
06:08:09.110 --> 06:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
periodically regularly uh we produce the
 
06:08:11.868 --> 06:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
Aur we pre-audit we um we pre-audit
 
06:08:14.190 --> 06:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
things we do a single uh single federal
 
06:08:16.110 --> 06:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
audit on all the financial documents of
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
the state we do lots and lots of things
 
06:08:21.070 --> 06:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
that people minimize as oh that's the
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
accounting stuff that you do without the
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
accounting stuff that you do people go
 
06:08:26.910 --> 06:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
to jail and the state can't open for
 
06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
business one of the other functions at
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
sort of another end of the spectrum is
 
06:08:32.750 --> 06:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
Public Works we build stuff we don't
 
06:08:35.590 --> 06:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
build roads and bridges that's do but we
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
build everything else we take care of
 
06:08:38.110 --> 06:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
the Deferred maintenance needs of the
 
06:08:40.110 --> 06:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
state we happen to be building a parking
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
garage on a site very nearby that looks
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
like a big puddle um we're building a
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
new YDC over in Hamstead for example
 
06:08:49.628 --> 06:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
we're doing lots and lots of we fix
 
06:08:51.628 --> 06:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
roofs and we do all sorts of things like
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
that um and that's to ensure a
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
consistent standard across state
 
06:08:58.548 --> 06:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
agencies engineers and architects who
 
06:09:00.270 --> 06:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
all do a very good job and are all very
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
smart people um as as is everyone um of
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise application management which
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
used to be called fdm we manage New
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first doit does most of the
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
computer operations of the state we
 
06:09:14.590 --> 06:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
manage the state's enterprise system the
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
piece of software that governs Personnel
 
06:09:17.280 --> 06:09:18.868 align:start position:0%
piece of software that governs Personnel
payroll

06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
accounting all sorts of functions
 
06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing all sorts of the functions of
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
state government it is the thing that
 
06:09:26.910 --> 06:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
sits on everyone's desk or it's like the
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
thing behind the thing that sits on
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
everyone's desk is a enormously
 
06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
complicated process and it is currently
 
06:09:35.788 --> 06:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
being upgraded dramatically um in in
 
06:09:37.390 --> 06:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
quote unquote going to the
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
cloud um and it's the it's the machine
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
or the software program through which on
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
some basic level we pay 13,000 people
 
06:09:48.788 --> 06:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
every two weeks I would argue to you
 
06:09:50.270 --> 06:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no more more important
 
06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
thing that Cassie and I do then pay
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
13,000 people every two weeks do you
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes that way we live yes
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
there we go that way we live that's a
 
06:10:02.030 --> 06:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
good point uh Personnel the state is the
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
state is 10 or 11,000 employees and it
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
and and or 13,000 if you include
 
06:10:09.628 --> 06:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
part-time and um we manage the state's
 
06:10:12.868 --> 06:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel function including the very um
 
06:10:14.910 --> 06:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
complicated task of negotiating
 
06:10:16.910 --> 06:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
contracts with 14 different employee un
 
06:10:18.910 --> 06:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
unions and we do some Education and
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
Training significant amount plant and
 
06:10:24.708 --> 06:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
property and Karen's behind me here um
 
06:10:26.468 --> 06:10:26.478 align:start position:0%
we manage more than 4 million square
 
06:10:29.310 --> 06:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
feet of office space which is a lot um
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
we manage more than 90 buildings in the
 
06:10:32.750 --> 06:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
state Enterprise we occasionally buy
 
06:10:35.788 --> 06:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
some and sell some uh we bought Grant a
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
place in Hall Street we hope to sell
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
some in lonia which are shall we say
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
less functional than some of the other
 
06:10:43.150 --> 06:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
buildings of the state this is a
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
significant task and it is it is an area
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
where where much money um shows up in
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
the budget as a transfer and is quote
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
unquote double counted because it shows
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
in an agency's uh in an agency's budget
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
as transferring to us and it shows up in
 
06:10:59.708 --> 06:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
our budget as the spend um which is a
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
which is a common accounting way of
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
paying for things like that um we also
 
06:11:05.070 --> 06:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
do Statewide Energy Management which is
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
a significant function that
 
06:11:10.030 --> 06:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
started I don't know when representative
 
06:11:11.750 --> 06:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
wer might be able to correct me if I say
 
06:11:16.948 --> 06:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.750 --> 06:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
enough the Statewide Energy Management
 
06:11:21.070 --> 06:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
when we started that office let's say
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
2008 and pretend I'm right it's just
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
easier that way uh procurement and
 
06:11:28.430 --> 06:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
Support Services a catchall division and
 
06:11:30.350 --> 06:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
a catchall agency we do Statewide
 
06:11:32.110 --> 06:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing it's actually one of the
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
oldest areas of the department where the
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
state created a purchasing AG agent in
 
06:11:37.468 --> 06:11:37.478 align:start position:0%
something like
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
1915 um to um to do purchasing for two
 
06:11:42.910 --> 06:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
reasons right one is one is for
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
competitive purchase and two is to
 
06:11:46.390 --> 06:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
assure that all the citizens of New
 
06:11:48.510 --> 06:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had a shot at the state's
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
business which is equally important that
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh we don't get we don't get suck on a
 
06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
guy we like and goes oh everybody likes
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
Fred everybody likes Tina let's just
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
keep using them nope we bid things and
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
we do a lot about 850 contracts more
 
06:12:05.910 --> 06:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
than 500 million in annual spend
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
but in addition in that particular
 
06:12:09.868 --> 06:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
division of the state we managed the
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
procurement card program which is a
 
06:12:13.230 --> 06:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
credit card we use to buy things we
 
06:12:14.708 --> 06:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
manage the merchant card program which
 
06:12:16.468 --> 06:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
is a when we take a credit card mostly
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
at liquor but in a lot of places um we
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
manage a surplus property if people have
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
been to White farm and bought an old
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
desk that was um uh in need of rehab
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's us unlike the federal government
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
who just dumps their um Surplus property
 
06:12:32.430 --> 06:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
we actually sell ours to make at least a
 
06:12:34.350 --> 06:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of money we run a federal
 
06:12:37.948 --> 06:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
food Sur plus distribution program out
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a warehouse on store Street which
 
06:12:41.830 --> 06:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
people don't always know about the
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
current governor actually said to me
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
once when I was talking about this he
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
goes what I never heard of that and and
 
06:12:50.110 --> 06:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
he was on the council for six years um
 
06:12:51.750 --> 06:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
and that's one of one of those things
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
Fleet Management we track uh track cars
 
06:12:55.628 --> 06:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
which has been a particular interest of
 
06:12:57.670 --> 06:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
people in the state since about 2010 We
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
Run The Statewide mail operation out of
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
the basement of the state house um we
 
06:13:05.788 --> 06:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
manage lots and lots of things there uh
 
06:13:07.628 --> 06:13:07.638 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to talk about risk and
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
benefits we risk and benefits began uh
 
06:13:13.150 --> 06:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
buying insurance and paying for workers
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
comp and involved into a
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
self-administered state-run healthc care
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
plan which is a big thing $500 million
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
per banum 37,000 retire retirees workers
 
06:13:26.190 --> 06:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
and family members we pay for health
 
06:13:28.190 --> 06:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
care for an awful lot of people it's
 
06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
actually a very good program and it's
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
probably the one of the best parts of
 
06:13:34.350 --> 06:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
our state benefit package our salaries
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
tend to be a little less than um they
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
might be in the private sector and their
 
06:13:40.510 --> 06:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
health benefits tend to be a little bit
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
more and for those of us who are aging
 
06:13:45.430 --> 06:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and consuming more healthc care
 
06:13:48.150 --> 06:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that would be me um It's a
 
06:13:50.548 --> 06:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
grand and glorious thing um but it's a
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
lot of work in a lot of people um and
 
06:13:55.468 --> 06:13:55.478 align:start position:0%
and they do a very good job and so the
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
retiring Health portion is more than
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
12,000 State retired state workers and
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
spouses um I shouldn't tell you this but
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
it was in the news recently as you might
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
remember some couple of issues here and
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
there with Anthem and the way we were
 
06:14:12.590 --> 06:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
able to get through that was not because
 
06:14:15.468 --> 06:14:15.478 align:start position:0%
of uh an outside company but because of
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
a very dedicated benefits team um who
 
06:14:20.670 --> 06:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
currently sit in a building on Pillsbury
 
06:14:23.788 --> 06:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
Street doing a very good job so we do a
 
06:14:26.350 --> 06:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
lot of everything and I I like I like to
 
06:14:28.948 --> 06:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
say in job interviews it's almost like
 
06:14:30.548 --> 06:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature stuck everything they
 
06:14:32.670 --> 06:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
didn't know what else to do with in one
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
place and it might seem that way but
 
06:14:36.150 --> 06:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's not we're actually a central
 
06:14:36.160 --> 06:14:37.270 align:start position:0%
it's not we're actually a central
Service

06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
Service
 
06:14:39.750 --> 06:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
Agency um we don't run the state's
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program we don't regulate Banks
 
06:14:43.350 --> 06:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate Insurance uh we don't
 
06:14:44.708 --> 06:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
sell lottery tickets we don't sell
 
06:14:47.548 --> 06:14:47.558 align:start position:0%
liquor at least not legally um but none
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
of those people can do their job if we
 
06:14:51.510 --> 06:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't do our job we're like the pit crew
 
06:14:53.788 --> 06:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
Richard Petty wins the race raise your
 
06:14:55.030 --> 06:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
hand if you've never heard of Richard
 
06:14:57.628 --> 06:14:57.638 align:start position:0%
Petty thank you um Richard Petty wins
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
the race but we're like the crew and you
 
06:15:01.390 --> 06:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
can't win a race unless you got a good
 
06:15:04.430 --> 06:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
crew um and so uh so that's who we are
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
and that's what we do because of that in
 
06:15:08.708 --> 06:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
addition the legislature when it creates
 
06:15:13.270 --> 06:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
very small agencies with 1 2 3 4 7 8
 
06:15:15.670 --> 06:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
people in them will routinely append
 
06:15:18.110 --> 06:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
them to the Department of administrative
 
06:15:19.310 --> 06:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
Services as quote unquote
 
06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
administratively attached you'll be
 
06:15:23.110 --> 06:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
hearing from a whole bunch of them when
 
06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
I finally stop talking um and um they're
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
mostly array behind me um and what that
 
06:15:32.670 --> 06:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
does what that means is they're
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
completely independent but we have we
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
help them with HR we helped them with uh
 
06:15:38.990 --> 06:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
with financial operations because um
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
you're unlikely to have a CFO if there's
 
06:15:42.910 --> 06:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
only two of you and you're unlikely to
 
06:15:44.510 --> 06:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
have an HR Director if there's only
 
06:15:47.070 --> 06:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
three of you and so we do that and it's
 
06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that we do why again
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
because we're a central Service Agency
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a function that we provide why
 
06:15:54.788 --> 06:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
should you care about us and not just
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
cut us as annoying
 
06:15:59.430 --> 06:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
overhead um which is a comment people
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
occasionally have and it's because um
 
06:16:04.548 --> 06:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
nobody really can do their job if we
 
06:16:07.150 --> 06:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
don't we touch every agency every day in
 
06:16:09.350 --> 06:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
every way and the processes and
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
procedures that affect the way state
 
06:16:13.868 --> 06:16:13.878 align:start position:0%
government works um are things that we
 
06:16:15.150 --> 06:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
administer whether it's the governor and
 
06:16:16.590 --> 06:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
counsel process whether it's going to
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal every fiscal item every GNC item
 
06:16:21.868 --> 06:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
passes across Michelle's desk for
 
06:16:23.830 --> 06:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
example um before it gets to the
 
06:16:25.708 --> 06:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
legislature or the governor depending on
 
06:16:29.070 --> 06:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
the on the body um the way we buy things
 
06:16:31.468 --> 06:16:31.478 align:start position:0%
the way we pay people the way we account
 
06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
for things the way we budget for things
 
06:16:36.830 --> 06:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
um every in every way we solve problems
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
in every way over over the course of
 
06:16:42.468 --> 06:16:42.478 align:start position:0%
time we have I have a little I have a
 
06:16:45.150 --> 06:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
little icon here with the little with
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
little dinguses that summarize this for
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
you but one of them has three people on
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
it and and an arrow and we do this and
 
06:16:55.310 --> 06:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
all this and more despite losing
 
06:16:57.310 --> 06:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
something like 41 full-time staff
 
06:16:57.320 --> 06:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
something like 41 full-time staff
between

06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:17:02.070 --> 06:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
2010 in 2017 out of a total of about 300
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
staff we are a very efficient
 
06:17:04.000 --> 06:17:05.670 align:start position:0%
staff we are a very efficient
organization

06:17:05.670 --> 06:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:17:08.910 --> 06:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
um we are sadly occasionally overworked
 
06:17:11.468 --> 06:17:11.478 align:start position:0%
um but we're happy to do it and I have
 
06:17:14.628 --> 06:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
said in budget hearings in the past um I
 
06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
have all the smartest people in state
 
06:17:18.510 --> 06:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
government who work for me um and some
 
06:17:20.430 --> 06:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
agency got annoyed with me and wanted to
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
play triv Pursuit to test that but um we
 
06:17:25.070 --> 06:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do that but I do I have very very
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
very good staff um and that's why you
 
06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
can rely on the work that we do with
 
06:17:33.190 --> 06:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
that I'll stop talking and let you ask
 
06:17:35.708 --> 06:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
any and all questions
 
06:17:39.468 --> 06:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.030 --> 06:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
answer thank you thank you commissioner
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
I always enjoy your presentations and
 
06:17:47.830 --> 06:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
your sense of humor but I frequently see
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
a friend who is a retiree who always
 
06:17:52.910 --> 06:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
complains about this money you saved on
 
06:17:55.948 --> 06:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
the retire health insurance and Caroline
 
06:17:58.350 --> 06:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
the subcontractor that does a lousy job
 
06:18:00.310 --> 06:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
every time I talk to him so is there
 
06:18:03.190 --> 06:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to be any change that I can relate
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
to him yeah do you want to
 
06:18:08.910 --> 06:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
um I our retirees have already
 
06:18:10.670 --> 06:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
experienced change we've been working
 
06:18:13.110 --> 06:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
with Caroline since January what
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
happened was we went out to bid and um
 
06:18:18.788 --> 06:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
we bid our retire Health uh coverage in
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
the alternative and we got prices on
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
doing just the medical which we had been
 
06:18:25.628 --> 06:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
doing for years and this time we also
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
priced out the um the pharmacy benefit
 
06:18:33.310 --> 06:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
so um that that um contract was very
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
advantageous to us I think we saved five
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
million-ish dollars like and um we were
 
06:18:41.990 --> 06:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
um stunned quite frankly because as you
 
06:18:44.110 --> 06:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
know representative Anthem has been a
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
partner to the state of New Hampshire
 
06:18:49.708 --> 06:18:49.718 align:start position:0%
for 20 plus years right and um so we
 
06:18:53.708 --> 06:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
were stunned when when um the operations
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
of their home delivery service was um
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
quite frankly a mess all right and what
 
06:19:01.990 --> 06:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
had happened was that they had
 
06:19:04.430 --> 06:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
transitioned to a platform that they did
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
not tell us they were transitioning to
 
06:19:08.788 --> 06:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't really working the way it
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
was intended to work so today it is
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
largely working the way it is intended
 
06:19:15.868 --> 06:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
to work because we we worked very very
 
06:19:17.548 --> 06:19:17.558 align:start position:0%
hard with Anthem I think that's one
 
06:19:19.030 --> 06:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
thing Charlie might have told you about
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
our division of risk and benefits is
 
06:19:24.190 --> 06:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
that we work very very um diligently
 
06:19:26.310 --> 06:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
over the years year in and year out to
 
06:19:28.910 --> 06:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
deliver good service to our members and
 
06:19:31.708 --> 06:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
so we have um recently um we're working
 
06:19:33.750 --> 06:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
on an audit of Caroline to make sure
 
06:19:36.750 --> 06:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
that all the oper issues have in fact
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
been fixed across the board systemically
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
so that our members are guaranteed good
 
06:19:46.510 --> 06:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
forward commissioner this may be a Karen
 
06:19:50.590 --> 06:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
question because it's about deferred
 
06:19:53.788 --> 06:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance and I I've heard you mention
 
06:19:55.270 --> 06:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
on a couple of different occasions that
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
that your estimate for what the the
 
06:19:59.070 --> 06:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
state has in far as deferred maintenance
 
06:20:02.708 --> 06:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
is roughly a billion dollars so my my
 
06:20:05.270 --> 06:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
question is how are we how do we
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize that is it just you know
 
06:20:09.948 --> 06:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
who's what roof is leaking the most or
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
or what's your order of prioritization
 
06:20:14.708 --> 06:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
and number two how are we doing over
 
06:20:16.750 --> 06:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
time we it's a billion now but are we
 
06:20:18.910 --> 06:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
gaining on it or are we falling behind
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
for example if I were to ask that
 
06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
question two years ago was it 1.2
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
million two 1.2 billion and now we've
 
06:20:27.468 --> 06:20:27.478 align:start position:0%
we've gained or going the other way I
 
06:20:28.830 --> 06:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let Karen talk in detail
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
about sort of how we how we prioritize
 
06:20:33.670 --> 06:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
and what we prioritize I I want to
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
caution like I a billion is a big round
 
06:20:38.910 --> 06:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
number which is why I picked it
 
06:20:42.670 --> 06:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
um we don't have the level of precision
 
06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
to tell you it's a billion precisely
 
06:20:47.548 --> 06:20:47.558 align:start position:0%
because there's no point in doing that
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
level of analysis if you gave me a
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
billion dollars I could fix stuff and
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
you would you would notice um but you
 
06:20:55.868 --> 06:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think I did anything that was
 
06:20:59.150 --> 06:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
silly um and uh it's sort of a big
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
ballpark number and and I remember six
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
or seven years ago when I started um at
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
a meeting with with Karen and and Steve
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
Lorenson and we talked about this and he
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
said I don't I don't have a good number
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
I have to know what the priorities are
 
06:21:13.110 --> 06:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
because I know we're going to we're
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to do about a million of it this
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
year and and I have to prioritize for
 
06:21:18.590 --> 06:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
the capital budget but I don't I don't
 
06:21:21.070 --> 06:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
need a precise number and and we are
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
making some strides toward toward being
 
06:21:26.468 --> 06:21:26.478 align:start position:0%
precise and I think it's getting better
 
06:21:28.750 --> 06:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious to see if Karen who's
 
06:21:30.310 --> 06:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
smarter than I am will think it's
 
06:21:30.320 --> 06:21:31.110 align:start position:0%
smarter than I am will think it's
getting

06:21:31.110 --> 06:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
getting
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
better thank you um I think one of the
 
06:21:35.468 --> 06:21:35.478 align:start position:0%
things that we have that's working
 
06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
against us is everything started costing
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
more recently and so what we thought was
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
maybe 500 million um a few years ago and
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
then we were infused with a lot of arpa
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
funds and were able to do a lot of work
 
06:21:49.628 --> 06:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
that money didn't go as far as we would
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
would have expected it to a few years
 
06:21:55.150 --> 06:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
ago so um one of the things that we well
 
06:21:56.468 --> 06:21:56.478 align:start position:0%
I want to touch on a couple things we
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
asked for about $150 million in the
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
capital budget this year those were the
 
06:22:01.788 --> 06:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
things that we thought needed to be done
 
06:22:04.708 --> 06:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
in the next two two years um we know
 
06:22:07.628 --> 06:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get 150 million um we
 
06:22:09.750 --> 06:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
also put some things aside that we said
 
06:22:11.830 --> 06:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
these can wait because as Charlie
 
06:22:13.310 --> 06:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned what's the point of asking for
 
06:22:14.910 --> 06:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
more than 150 million when you know
 
06:22:17.070 --> 06:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get it um the other
 
06:22:18.510 --> 06:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we're in the middle of doing
 
06:22:20.670 --> 06:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
currently is we're conducting a facility
 
06:22:22.750 --> 06:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
condition assessment on uh the majority
 
06:22:26.110 --> 06:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
of our facilities which will detail all
 
06:22:28.510 --> 06:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
of our infrastructure the age of that
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the condition of that
 
06:22:31.868 --> 06:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that will be a really
 
06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
useful tool going forward and saying
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
these our immediate needs so you know
 
06:22:38.030 --> 06:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the100 Million worth of
 
06:22:40.990 --> 06:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that we should be doing this year
 
06:22:42.510 --> 06:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
here's what five years looks like here's
 
06:22:44.190 --> 06:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
what 10 years looks like so we are
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
getting a better handle on um not only
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
the overall cost but kind of scheduling
 
06:22:51.628 --> 06:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
that stuff out and prioritizing it in
 
06:22:51.638 --> 06:22:55.948 align:start position:0%
that stuff out and prioritizing it in
that

06:22:55.948 --> 06:22:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
way thank you very much for your
 
06:22:57.840 --> 06:23:05.110 align:start position:0%
way thank you very much for your
presentation

06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:29.150 --> 06:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
next um right up there he is doing that
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
we only have copies for you what we have
 
06:23:35.798 --> 06:23:40.628 align:start position:0%
we only have copies for you what we have
thank

06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.270 --> 06:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon Kristen monani here for the
 
06:23:52.430 --> 06:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
office of the advocate for special
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
education uh we are a new agency as of a
 
06:24:01.310 --> 06:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
year ago and um I believe we had about
 
06:24:03.910 --> 06:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
five minutes budgeted here so we it is a
 
06:24:05.948 --> 06:24:05.958 align:start position:0%
short Pres presentation to try to comply
 
06:24:08.830 --> 06:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
with that um just to highlight a couple
 
06:24:11.670 --> 06:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
of things you know I think I I'm going
 
06:24:14.670 --> 06:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
to stay focused predominantly on budget
 
06:24:19.948 --> 06:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
um we when I took the office uh in July
 
06:24:19.958 --> 06:24:20.910 align:start position:0%
um we when I took the office uh in July
of

06:24:20.910 --> 06:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:24:24.150 --> 06:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
20123 it was with a very expansive State
 
06:24:27.030 --> 06:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
Legislative mandate that really covered
 
06:24:29.390 --> 06:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that I Services were
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
provided as federally and state mandated
 
06:24:34.510 --> 06:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
for 30,000 students with IEPs in the
 
06:24:36.548 --> 06:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we spend about
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
$900 million on special
 
06:24:43.230 --> 06:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
education um for some districts it's 25%
 
06:24:48.150 --> 06:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
or more of their education budget um if
 
06:24:49.868 --> 06:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
that wasn't enough the statute went on
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
to say we also were tracking metrics of
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
all sorts of disabilities um Staffing
 
06:24:59.628 --> 06:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
and Personnel to provide for those um we
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
were working on
 
06:25:04.990 --> 06:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislative um initiatives that we found
 
06:25:07.270 --> 06:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
based on our work needed to be
 
06:25:09.868 --> 06:25:09.878 align:start position:0%
implemented and a whole host of other
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
things that gets us involved across um
 
06:25:15.510 --> 06:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies that really touch
 
06:25:18.270 --> 06:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
special education so vocational rehab
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
under doe the area agencies that work
 
06:25:24.510 --> 06:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
with um a lot of the families that have
 
06:25:27.150 --> 06:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh students with special needs and we're
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
finding more and more that there is a
 
06:25:32.948 --> 06:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
crosscurrent between doe and DHHS in
 
06:25:35.070 --> 06:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
terms of how we're placing students and
 
06:25:37.110 --> 06:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
where responsibilities are lying it's
 
06:25:39.110 --> 06:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
very unclear in a lot of situations and
 
06:25:43.350 --> 06:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
so we are triaging multiple cases where
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
um because of that lack of clarity
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of finger pointing and we
 
06:25:48.708 --> 06:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
have students and families in and out of
 
06:25:48.718 --> 06:25:49.948 align:start position:0%
have students and families in and out of
hospitals

06:25:49.948 --> 06:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:25:52.270 --> 06:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
constantly drugged to be honest when
 
06:25:54.548 --> 06:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be Etc so there are a
 
06:25:57.628 --> 06:25:57.638 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of different priorities um
 
06:26:00.110 --> 06:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of systemic work for the agency
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
that I detailed in just a few pretty
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
broad priorities in here in addition to
 
06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
dealing with all of the cases um just to
 
06:26:10.430 --> 06:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
give you a sense uh my colleague Tim
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
Lenahan joined me um really in late
 
06:26:16.670 --> 06:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
spring you know may into June of
 
06:26:21.990 --> 06:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
2024 um and between the two of us we've
 
06:26:25.590 --> 06:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
probably handled about 40 cases um
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
within a year we do not want to be an
 
06:26:31.390 --> 06:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
agency that just provides information to
 
06:26:32.590 --> 06:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
parents so that's one of the things
 
06:26:34.390 --> 06:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's really been debated there are
 
06:26:36.390 --> 06:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
lots of groups within the
 
06:26:38.750 --> 06:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
state that have funds to provide
 
06:26:40.910 --> 06:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
information to parents of students with
 
06:26:43.788 --> 06:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
disabilities um all of the families that
 
06:26:45.830 --> 06:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
come to us have more than exhausted all
 
06:26:48.708 --> 06:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
of those informational based resources
 
06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and are still in situations we've
 
06:26:53.430 --> 06:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
we've triaged predominantly cases where
 
06:26:56.548 --> 06:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
students are out of school sometimes out
 
06:27:00.030 --> 06:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
of state in treatment facilities um many
 
06:27:01.830 --> 06:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
of them have been out of school for
 
06:27:04.350 --> 06:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
multiple years because they can't agree
 
06:27:05.708 --> 06:27:05.718 align:start position:0%
with their school districts on something
 
06:27:08.868 --> 06:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
that keeps the child safe and educated
 
06:27:11.788 --> 06:27:11.798 align:start position:0%
within the schools so um it it triage is
 
06:27:13.708 --> 06:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
a very accurate word many of those
 
06:27:17.310 --> 06:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
families caregivers have gone through
 
06:27:20.910 --> 06:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
um really terrible circumstances um as I
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
said in and out of hospitals
 
06:27:27.230 --> 06:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
Etc we don't want to be just triaging um
 
06:27:30.750 --> 06:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
there are 30,000 students with IEPs um
 
06:27:33.350 --> 06:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
we have worked the state systems are
 
06:27:36.750 --> 06:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
really antiquate so tracking even
 
06:27:39.270 --> 06:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
complaints even
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
um indications that parents are
 
06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
rejecting their IEPs which doesn't mean
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
they don't want services for their
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
children it means they think the
 
06:27:51.070 --> 06:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
services being offered don't provide any
 
06:27:52.868 --> 06:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
benefit or don't provide enough benefit
 
06:27:54.670 --> 06:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
or the children are in the wrong place
 
06:27:56.750 --> 06:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
and that's creating constant issues and
 
06:27:58.830 --> 06:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
and as we said you know often ends up
 
06:28:02.070 --> 06:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
with a child out of school um suspended
 
06:28:05.548 --> 06:28:05.558 align:start position:0%
constantly Etc so uh we were not even as
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
a state really looking at how many
 
06:28:09.830 --> 06:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
rejected IEPs there were it turns out we
 
06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
think um based on work we've done to get
 
06:28:16.750 --> 06:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
um amended s SP 340 in place it's
 
06:28:18.910 --> 06:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
probably at least a th000 a year which
 
06:28:20.150 --> 06:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
is a number that I thought was pretty
 
06:28:22.910 --> 06:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
low um we rely on doe to track that for
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
us but that you know we did push
 
06:28:27.310 --> 06:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
legislation over the year to start to
 
06:28:28.190 --> 06:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
get that
 
06:28:31.430 --> 06:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
tracking um you know we're saying of
 
06:28:34.270 --> 06:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
those we'd like our office to be able to
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
address about 200 a year and again that
 
06:28:39.350 --> 06:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
is a tiny fraction 200 cases a
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
year providing much more than
 
06:28:43.948 --> 06:28:43.958 align:start position:0%
information really trying to resolve
 
06:28:46.190 --> 06:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
those cases so that we don't end up with
 
06:28:49.150 --> 06:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
these crisis situations um you know
 
06:28:52.590 --> 06:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
that's a tiny fraction of a total um but
 
06:28:56.788 --> 06:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
in looking at what it's taken to to do
 
06:29:01.230 --> 06:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
40 uh we have a proposed org chart you
 
06:29:04.830 --> 06:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
know in here on the second page um
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
and those positions we you know some of
 
06:29:09.230 --> 06:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
them are actually approved but unfunded
 
06:29:10.708 --> 06:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
at the moment so that is the big
 
06:29:14.708 --> 06:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
difference between um our prioritized
 
06:29:16.628 --> 06:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
needs and our efficiency budget again
 
06:29:18.350 --> 06:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget was created before
 
06:29:20.990 --> 06:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
the agency existed um and I think
 
06:29:22.468 --> 06:29:22.478 align:start position:0%
without any reference to what it was
 
06:29:25.868 --> 06:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
actually going to take to attempt to do
 
06:29:25.878 --> 06:29:27.070 align:start position:0%
actually going to take to attempt to do
our

06:29:27.070 --> 06:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:29:29.190 --> 06:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
job with that I would just take
 
06:29:29.200 --> 06:29:35.670 align:start position:0%
job with that I would just take
questions

06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.990 --> 06:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
do you do you mostly meet with people
 
06:29:41.270 --> 06:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
like do you go to IEP uh meetings yes
 
06:29:43.990 --> 06:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely and is that is that arguably
 
06:29:48.548 --> 06:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
the the focus of your job mostly so um I
 
06:29:50.910 --> 06:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
would say we need just as much focus on
 
06:29:53.788 --> 06:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
the you know big pieces like how voke
 
06:29:56.628 --> 06:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
rehab interacts in for students age 16
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
to 22 and the fact that families don't
 
06:29:59.868 --> 06:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
think they're getting any of those
 
06:30:01.948 --> 06:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
Services despite Lots being spent on
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
that so there are a lot of big policy
 
06:30:03.680 --> 06:30:04.590 align:start position:0%
that so there are a lot of big policy
pieces

06:30:04.590 --> 06:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
06:30:06.868 --> 06:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
and agency pieces but yes when I say
 
06:30:09.548 --> 06:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
we've triaged kind of 40 cases it has
 
06:30:12.190 --> 06:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
meant either Tim or I being there front
 
06:30:14.070 --> 06:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
and center in IEP meetings it's never
 
06:30:16.750 --> 06:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
one it's multiple and then we've also
 
06:30:18.628 --> 06:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
assisted families in bringing multiple
 
06:30:21.390 --> 06:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
cases to doe process the state doe
 
06:30:23.390 --> 06:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
complaint resolution mechanisms we're
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
seeing such a small number you know 10
 
06:30:29.230 --> 06:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
to 15 a year maybe of out of out of
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
thousands right who were saying we
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
reject the IEP very few were getting to
 
06:30:35.948 --> 06:30:35.958 align:start position:0%
an actual resolution and it's because
 
06:30:37.868 --> 06:30:37.878 align:start position:0%
families felt like they didn't have the
 
06:30:39.830 --> 06:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
resources to go through that process I'm
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to tell you they really didn't for
 
06:30:43.628 --> 06:30:43.638 align:start position:0%
us to do it effectively and we have been
 
06:30:45.830 --> 06:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
effective with doing it to get to
 
06:30:47.868 --> 06:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
resolutions um Sometimes some of which
 
06:30:49.548 --> 06:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
save the state quite a bit of money
 
06:30:51.150 --> 06:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
because that money is being triaged
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in hospital care and in
 
06:30:57.750 --> 06:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
long-term pieces um hundreds of hours on
 
06:30:59.590 --> 06:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
cases that we actually have to get to a
 
06:31:01.310 --> 06:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution but again we're doing
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
that after years of crisis do you think
 
06:31:07.868 --> 06:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
most families don't are are moderately
 
06:31:09.548 --> 06:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
unaware or at least a lot of families
 
06:31:11.548 --> 06:31:11.558 align:start position:0%
unaware of the dispute resolution
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
process no they know about it um they
 
06:31:18.190 --> 06:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
just I have a la I practiced litigation
 
06:31:20.910 --> 06:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
for six years before I went on to run
 
06:31:24.030 --> 06:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
schools um it takes me a lot of time to
 
06:31:25.628 --> 06:31:25.638 align:start position:0%
get through it we're dealing sometimes
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
with you know thousands of pages of
 
06:31:30.110 --> 06:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
documents produced on both sides
 
06:31:32.030 --> 06:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
obligations to produce obligations to
 
06:31:34.270 --> 06:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
meet you know all sorts of Court dead we
 
06:31:38.468 --> 06:31:38.478 align:start position:0%
just went through a hearing last week um
 
06:31:39.670 --> 06:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know where there was argument
 
06:31:41.270 --> 06:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
constantly about whether the witnesses
 
06:31:42.628 --> 06:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
should be thrown out whether we'
 
06:31:44.350 --> 06:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
properly complied with processes and
 
06:31:47.910 --> 06:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
procedures so for parents it it is just
 
06:31:49.590 --> 06:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
really daunting so they do know about it
 
06:31:51.350 --> 06:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
all of the parents we work with are are
 
06:31:54.070 --> 06:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
fully versed in the understanding peace
 
06:31:55.270 --> 06:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
they've been through parent information
 
06:31:56.510 --> 06:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
centers they've been through all sorts
 
06:31:58.948 --> 06:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
of trainings they believe they can't do
 
06:32:01.590 --> 06:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
it themselves and I can't tell you that
 
06:32:03.548 --> 06:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
in all cases they're wrong it depends on
 
06:32:03.558 --> 06:32:04.628 align:start position:0%
in all cases they're wrong it depends on
how

06:32:04.628 --> 06:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:32:06.110 --> 06:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
vigorously they're going to be up
 
06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
against attorneys on the other side do
 
06:32:13.310 --> 06:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
you do you find that um are you uh uh is
 
06:32:15.150 --> 06:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
your relationship with
 
06:32:20.110 --> 06:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
doe adversarial or no actually um I I I
 
06:32:22.468 --> 06:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
think I worked hard on cultivating this
 
06:32:24.670 --> 06:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
Tim has worked hard on cultivating um
 
06:32:26.910 --> 06:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
some strong relationships with DHHS
 
06:32:29.110 --> 06:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
because um in bringing him in he came
 
06:32:30.430 --> 06:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
from a different background that had
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
more of that DHHS component than I did
 
06:32:36.110 --> 06:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to say no I actually
 
06:32:39.230 --> 06:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
think it's collaborative we worked um
 
06:32:40.670 --> 06:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
really hard with them after the first
 
06:32:42.430 --> 06:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
special education audit came out this
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
year that was of dispute resolution
 
06:32:46.708 --> 06:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
about hundred and some pages pretty
 
06:32:48.430 --> 06:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
negative towards doe and I said I think
 
06:32:50.388 --> 06:32:50.398 align:start position:0%
some of this is fair some of it isn't
 
06:32:51.310 --> 06:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
but worked with them very
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to try to do a first
 
06:32:55.388 --> 06:32:55.398 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and try to start
 
06:32:57.230 --> 06:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
tracking precisely you know where are
 
06:32:59.270 --> 06:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
these complaints going and what's coming
 
06:33:00.910 --> 06:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
to the state what's getting resolved
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
another big special education audit do
 
06:33:05.830 --> 06:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
out almost immediately that is not just
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the dispute resolution it's the whole
 
06:33:10.350 --> 06:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
shebang of the 900 million spent on
 
06:33:12.430 --> 06:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
special ed so we'll see what those
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
results are I'm sure there will be a lot
 
06:33:17.270 --> 06:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
to address there as well um as I said it
 
06:33:19.430 --> 06:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
is impossible for us with two of us
 
06:33:21.830 --> 06:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
right now to meet what's in that State
 
06:33:25.628 --> 06:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
Legislative um creation of our office uh
 
06:33:28.430 --> 06:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
so so either we need the Staffing or we
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
need to really readdress what it is that
 
06:33:32.430 --> 06:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're expected to do and in the cases
 
06:33:36.670 --> 06:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
that you're involved in are you mostly
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
um it's the district on the other side
 
06:33:41.430 --> 06:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
the school district all of whom are
 
06:33:43.150 --> 06:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
represented by
 
06:33:46.030 --> 06:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys okay thank you I'm sorry all
 
06:33:46.040 --> 06:33:47.150 align:start position:0%
attorneys okay thank you I'm sorry all
thanks

06:33:47.150 --> 06:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
06:33:49.990 --> 06:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much your testimony
 
06:33:52.150 --> 06:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank
 
06:33:55.150 --> 06:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
you okay going to bring up the
 
06:34:04.468 --> 06:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:07.750 --> 06:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you good
 
06:34:10.030 --> 06:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh good afternoon my name is
 
06:34:12.110 --> 06:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
Steven Walker director of the
 
06:34:14.030 --> 06:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship program
 
06:34:16.230 --> 06:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
CLS for short and with me is Charlotte
 
06:34:18.750 --> 06:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
Harding our stewardship
 
06:34:21.070 --> 06:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
specialist the mission of CLS is to
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
ensure the state's Investments and
 
06:34:26.110 --> 06:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
conservation interests are looked after
 
06:34:28.548 --> 06:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh we refer to the overarching function
 
06:34:30.910 --> 06:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
that CLS performs as stewardship and

by legislative act and we hold hearings
 
06:38:36.270 --> 06:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
on housing matters related to appeals
 
06:38:39.030 --> 06:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
from local planning and zoning boards of
 
06:38:43.548 --> 06:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
adjustment um we have concurrent
 
06:38:46.150 --> 06:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with the Superior Court um
 
06:38:48.388 --> 06:38:48.398 align:start position:0%
in these matters although the supremor
 
06:38:50.150 --> 06:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
court jurisdiction is somewhat broader
 
06:38:54.350 --> 06:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
but we we proceed in much the same way
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
um we are administratively attached to
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
06:39:03.388 --> 06:39:03.398 align:start position:0%
services our um budget is really uh
 
06:39:05.628 --> 06:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
pretty Bare Bones there's no significant
 
06:39:07.388 --> 06:39:07.398 align:start position:0%
deviation from prior years other than
 
06:39:10.670 --> 06:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
the 4% reduction that was um requested
 
06:39:13.910 --> 06:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we've accomplished that um we do
 
06:39:15.510 --> 06:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
have one program that is being
 
06:39:17.830 --> 06:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
implemented currently called Legal files
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
it's a case management software package
 
06:39:23.468 --> 06:39:23.478 align:start position:0%
that was purchased last fiscal year uh
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
and is being implemented now and there
 
06:39:27.430 --> 06:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
is ongoing expense with that for
 
06:39:30.110 --> 06:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes with the vendor
 
06:39:32.510 --> 06:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's being uh conducted primarily
 
06:39:34.990 --> 06:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
through the uh Department of um
 
06:39:39.190 --> 06:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
Information Technology at this point um
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:39:44.590 --> 06:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
um in comparison to the court system in
 
06:39:46.910 --> 06:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the hearings that we conduct
 
06:39:49.150 --> 06:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
our membership is made up as I mentioned
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
of Specialists people who have either
 
06:39:54.590 --> 06:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
extensive backgrounds in land use and
 
06:39:57.070 --> 06:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
planning or land surveying in the case
 
06:40:01.030 --> 06:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
of um Ed Rogers um Stephanie is uh a
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
land as a planner and has had municip
 
06:40:06.070 --> 06:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
experience in that regard and I've been
 
06:40:08.708 --> 06:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
an attorney since 1988 and have had 12
 
06:40:10.990 --> 06:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
years combined experience on various
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
planning and zoning boards in different
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state so we bring
 
06:40:18.030 --> 06:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
an an a level of expertise that uh may
 
06:40:19.788 --> 06:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
or may not be available in a court
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
system we also um process appeals from
 
06:40:26.750 --> 06:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
the appeal request until the completion
 
06:40:28.830 --> 06:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the appeal in approximately six
 
06:40:31.350 --> 06:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
months so that's far faster than getting
 
06:40:34.270 --> 06:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
before judge and having a hearing and uh
 
06:40:36.030 --> 06:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
decision rendered by a superior court
 
06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
judge so we do serve a purpose on the
 
06:40:42.350 --> 06:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
housing side of things um as I mentioned
 
06:40:45.830 --> 06:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
our budget is essentially um unchanged
 
06:40:47.788 --> 06:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
from prior years with the exception of
 
06:40:50.750 --> 06:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
the uh legal files process that that I
 
06:40:53.070 --> 06:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh with that I'd be happy to
 
06:40:58.230 --> 06:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:04.990 --> 06:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.030 --> 06:41:07.040 align:start position:0%

06:42:29.830 --> 06:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
those positions the third of that was
 
06:42:31.788 --> 06:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
within a reclassification process
 
06:42:33.230 --> 06:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer months and was a
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
approved at the um September 25th GNC
 
06:42:40.190 --> 06:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
meeting and so that was also recently
 
06:42:42.750 --> 06:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
posted so um although we do have three
 
06:42:45.270 --> 06:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies they we do not expect them to
 
06:42:47.150 --> 06:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
remain vacant very long we are actively
 
06:42:49.388 --> 06:42:49.398 align:start position:0%
hiring and we have received a number of
 
06:42:52.788 --> 06:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants for um two of those
 
06:42:55.030 --> 06:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
positions and one of the positions was
 
06:42:57.468 --> 06:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
just posted last week um so we do expect
 
06:43:00.190 --> 06:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to fill them rather
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
quickly um and so you will see in our
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget ask here um that we are asking
 
06:43:08.270 --> 06:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
for additional positions in our
 
06:43:11.190 --> 06:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs um and that is due to
 
06:43:14.590 --> 06:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
the growing number of um inquiries that
 
06:43:16.310 --> 06:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
we take in as an office um so if you
 
06:43:19.388 --> 06:43:19.398 align:start position:0%
look under the office overview page um
 
06:43:21.510 --> 06:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
three of the slideshow here um you will
 
06:43:24.030 --> 06:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
see that we receive review and respond
 
06:43:26.590 --> 06:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
to um so this is our last annual year
 
06:43:29.628 --> 06:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
our preliminary data shows 349 citizen
 
06:43:31.910 --> 06:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
complaints came within a year's
 
06:43:34.670 --> 06:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
time um during that time frame we also
 
06:43:34.680 --> 06:43:36.948 align:start position:0%
time um during that time frame we also
reviewed

06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
2,939 incident reports um and so that's
 
06:43:42.270 --> 06:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
inclusive of critical incidents from DCF
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
and restraint and seclusion reports of
 
06:43:46.430 --> 06:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
children um and so we continue to
 
06:43:48.310 --> 06:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
receive a growing number of those also
 
06:43:49.750 --> 06:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see the last bullet point there
 
06:43:52.670 --> 06:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
reports to the last three months of case
 
06:43:54.788 --> 06:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
loads that are carried within the office
 
06:43:57.070 --> 06:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
our two assistant child Advocates carry
 
06:43:59.310 --> 06:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
each um approximately with an average of
 
06:44:03.070 --> 06:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
45 cases at any given time our legal aid
 
06:44:04.948 --> 06:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
carries an average of 20 cases at any
 
06:44:07.510 --> 06:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
given time and I myself carry an average
 
06:44:10.350 --> 06:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
of eight cases at any given time um I am
 
06:44:12.030 --> 06:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
carrying cases and the legal aid is
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
carrying cases due to the rising numbers
 
06:44:17.868 --> 06:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
and our inability to quickly close them
 
06:44:20.190 --> 06:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
um leading to more cases than can be
 
06:44:21.830 --> 06:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
managed by two individuals so we are
 
06:44:23.670 --> 06:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
sharing that load right now but even
 
06:44:25.868 --> 06:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
sharing that load is an overwhelming
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
number for our office to try to manage
 
06:44:30.310 --> 06:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
with the small numbers that we have um
 
06:44:32.030 --> 06:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
so given that we are asking for that
 
06:44:34.190 --> 06:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
additional assistant child advocate
 
06:44:37.150 --> 06:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
position to assist with taking cases um
 
06:44:39.708 --> 06:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
and reducing them down to a reasonable
 
06:44:42.750 --> 06:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
number um which would be a a reasonable
 
06:44:45.150 --> 06:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
number ideally should be under 20 each
 
06:44:46.830 --> 06:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
even with the additional position we do
 
06:44:49.468 --> 06:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
not foresee us being able to be under 20
 
06:44:52.350 --> 06:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
each um so we're really asking here for
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
as conservative as we can to be able to
 
06:44:55.868 --> 06:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
make cases more manageable ensure that
 
06:44:58.270 --> 06:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting to the safe need safety
 
06:45:01.270 --> 06:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
needs in a timely fashion um we also
 
06:45:02.990 --> 06:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
have in our prioritized needs and ask
 
06:45:06.388 --> 06:45:06.398 align:start position:0%
for a case Aid position the case Aid and
 
06:45:09.510 --> 06:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
the legal aid in the office they do the
 
06:45:11.430 --> 06:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
review and monitoring of all of those
 
06:45:13.910 --> 06:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
incident reports so that almost 3,000
 
06:45:15.430 --> 06:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
incident reports that we receive they
 
06:45:17.788 --> 06:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
review and read every single one of them
 
06:45:19.708 --> 06:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
look for any immediate action we may
 
06:45:21.708 --> 06:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
need to take as an agency to ensure
 
06:45:24.310 --> 06:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
safety of those children and work with a
 
06:45:26.708 --> 06:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
larger team to make sure we are fully
 
06:45:29.548 --> 06:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
assessing uh dcf's response to those
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
incidents um and that they are acting
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
timely to safety of children um those
 
06:45:37.910 --> 06:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
continue to grow year toe um as you will
 
06:45:40.510 --> 06:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
see here under the the case Aid slide um
 
06:45:43.388 --> 06:45:43.398 align:start position:0%
there is a 17.2% increase from the last
 
06:45:45.910 --> 06:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
bium when we looked at um what we were
 
06:45:48.948 --> 06:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
taking in so we continue to um grow in
 
06:45:52.548 --> 06:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
year also in our prioritized needs we
 
06:45:56.270 --> 06:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
have a reorganization and
 
06:45:58.468 --> 06:45:58.478 align:start position:0%
reclassification of positions um this is
 
06:46:00.350 --> 06:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
due to the growing office and the need
 
06:46:03.948 --> 06:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
to have a um more management position in
 
06:46:06.510 --> 06:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
between myself and the office staff as
 
06:46:08.350 --> 06:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
we continue to grow I'm currently
 
06:46:10.948 --> 06:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
responsible for all of the um in office
 
06:46:15.750 --> 06:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
HR tasks um as well as a supervisor over
 
06:46:17.270 --> 06:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
the case Aid positions because they have
 
06:46:20.270 --> 06:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
a very unique role um and need constant
 
06:46:22.030 --> 06:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
supervision on a week- toe basis which I
 
06:46:23.990 --> 06:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
cannot offer at this
 
06:46:27.150 --> 06:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
time um and so then to quickly wrap up
 
06:46:29.948 --> 06:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
we um here also made note of other line
 
06:46:32.910 --> 06:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
items um our overall operating expenses
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
have been impacted in every other line
 
06:46:38.070 --> 06:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
item due to this 4% decrease um in order
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
to get to that 4% decrease we did unfund
 
06:46:43.628 --> 06:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
a position in the office and still had a
 
06:46:46.310 --> 06:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
significant loss in operating expenses
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
so the the charts um on the next couple
 
06:46:51.628 --> 06:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
of pages actually show those changes
 
06:46:54.270 --> 06:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
compared to fiscal year 25 and if you go
 
06:46:58.830 --> 06:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
to the um the bar graph it shows um our
 
06:47:01.230 --> 06:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
operating expenses in fiscal year 25 are
 
06:47:04.468 --> 06:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
at 70,000 and and um in the efficiency
 
06:47:07.670 --> 06:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
budget for 26 we're down to 18,900
 
06:47:10.070 --> 06:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's a 73% decrease in operating
 
06:47:12.190 --> 06:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
expenses that is because we cannot
 
06:47:14.590 --> 06:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
control the pay and benefit expenses
 
06:47:16.030 --> 06:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
that we have in the office and we cannot
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
control our rents leases and payments to
 
06:47:19.990 --> 06:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
other state agencies so the only aspect
 
06:47:21.788 --> 06:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
of our budget that is within our control
 
06:47:23.990 --> 06:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
is so minuscule that we would not be
 
06:47:25.830 --> 06:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
able to continue the functions of our
 
06:47:28.350 --> 06:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
office we would not we would run out of
 
06:47:30.910 --> 06:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
paper and pens at some point um as well
 
06:47:33.310 --> 06:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
as our ability to travel um travel is
 
06:47:34.830 --> 06:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
very important for our office to be able
 
06:47:36.990 --> 06:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
to get to see children in person and we
 
06:47:38.548 --> 06:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
would have to drastically cut our
 
06:47:41.468 --> 06:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
instate and out of state
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:51.070 --> 06:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions with the uh with the incident
 
06:47:54.510 --> 06:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
reports and citizen complaints um and
 
06:47:58.230 --> 06:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
then you you mentioned that uh you
 
06:48:01.230 --> 06:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
carried an average of 45 cases each are
 
06:48:02.868 --> 06:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
those a combination of the incident
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
reports and the citizen complaints or
 
06:48:07.708 --> 06:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
what what constitutes a case thank you
 
06:48:10.590 --> 06:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that no the um the cases
 
06:48:12.948 --> 06:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
would specifically be the citizen
 
06:48:15.030 --> 06:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
complaints that have come in the
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
incident reports we do not count those
 
06:48:18.868 --> 06:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
in case numbers those are managed
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
separately and as IID mentioned everyone
 
06:48:22.468 --> 06:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
is viewed and looked at but if it's a
 
06:48:24.310 --> 06:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
considered a case it comes in through
 
06:48:26.388 --> 06:48:26.398 align:start position:0%
citizen complaint and then we find that
 
06:48:28.750 --> 06:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's um justifiable reason for us to
 
06:48:31.868 --> 06:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
dig deeper into that okay how how how
 
06:48:33.830 --> 06:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
long does it take on average to resolve
 
06:48:33.840 --> 06:48:34.510 align:start position:0%
long does it take on average to resolve
a

06:48:34.510 --> 06:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:48:37.230 --> 06:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
case I would say in past years it would
 
06:48:38.948 --> 06:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
we would in a couple of months be able
 
06:48:41.150 --> 06:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
to resolve a case as of recently cases
 
06:48:43.468 --> 06:48:43.478 align:start position:0%
in particularly those involving DCF are
 
06:48:45.990 --> 06:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
a lot more complex um there with those
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
complexities it requires many more
 
06:48:49.310 --> 06:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
meetings and so we're carrying cases for
 
06:48:50.830 --> 06:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
a significantly longer period of time
 
06:48:53.030 --> 06:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
than we ever had before we've had cases
 
06:48:54.750 --> 06:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
that have been open for more than six
 
06:48:56.270 --> 06:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
months that are not resolved that
 
06:48:58.190 --> 06:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
require multiple meetings with the
 
06:49:01.350 --> 06:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
agency with children with providers um
 
06:49:03.590 --> 06:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so the
 
06:49:06.350 --> 06:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
workload associated with a case is a lot
 
06:49:08.310 --> 06:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
more cumbersome now than it ever has
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
been before for our office okay thank
 
06:49:14.788 --> 06:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you very
 
06:49:15.788 --> 06:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony greatly
 
06:49:17.190 --> 06:49:17.200 align:start position:0%

1962 uh we publish an annual report on
 
06:51:52.708 --> 06:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
November 1st a copy of the executive
 
06:51:54.628 --> 06:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
summary as the first four pages of this
 
06:51:57.708 --> 06:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
packet I have um a couple copies here
 
06:51:59.270 --> 06:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
for those of you who might be interested
 
06:52:01.628 --> 06:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
of the 41-page report that sets a policy
 
06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:08.670 --> 06:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
um let's see so turning again to page
 
06:52:10.670 --> 06:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
five of the packet that I put before you
 
06:52:14.070 --> 06:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
um you can see um the very last bullet
 
06:52:16.468 --> 06:52:16.478 align:start position:0%
uh talks about the fact that we are
 
06:52:18.070 --> 06:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
overse that the commission is overseeing
 
06:52:20.548 --> 06:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
two ARA funded projects this year and
 
06:52:23.830 --> 06:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
next um other agencies running projects
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
often will hire a Project Director to
 
06:52:29.750 --> 06:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
oversee um um a project no additional
 
06:52:31.510 --> 06:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
staff were hired to oversee this work
 
06:52:33.430 --> 06:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
and complete this big
 
06:52:35.750 --> 06:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
lift the driving reason the commission
 
06:52:38.350 --> 06:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
was uh was created is is in response to
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh changing demographics currently over
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
onethird of the state's population is
 
06:52:46.270 --> 06:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
over the age of 55 the 80 plus plus
 
06:52:49.030 --> 06:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
population is currently 4.2% of our po
 
06:52:50.070 --> 06:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
our state's
 
06:52:52.070 --> 06:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
population the Department of Business
 
06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs population
 
06:52:57.030 --> 06:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
projection suggest that by 2050 close to
 
06:52:59.310 --> 06:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
12% of our state's population will be
 
06:53:02.310 --> 06:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
over the age of 80 uh this rise is set
 
06:53:04.388 --> 06:53:04.398 align:start position:0%
to have significant impact on our state
 
06:53:06.350 --> 06:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
and how on our how our communities
 
06:53:09.468 --> 06:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
function and on our County and state
 
06:53:11.310 --> 06:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
budgets so with this I'm just going to
 
06:53:13.510 --> 06:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
shift to talking about what is actually
 
06:53:17.190 --> 06:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
in the budget um by looking at
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
Pages um in your in your packet your
 
06:53:22.430 --> 06:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
budget packet uh Pages 2011 and 202 you
 
06:53:24.788 --> 06:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
can see that we're a very small agency
 
06:53:28.110 --> 06:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
with a very basic office operations 85%
 
06:53:30.230 --> 06:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
of our budget um is for salary and
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
benefits in fiscal year uh 26
 
06:53:36.150 --> 06:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page uh 203 and view
 
06:53:39.628 --> 06:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh line 60 benefits um
 
06:53:41.190 --> 06:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the largest increase to
 
06:53:43.750 --> 06:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
our budget compared to um to previous
 
06:53:46.230 --> 06:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
years initially when I took this role I
 
06:53:49.430 --> 06:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
did not utilize um the health benefits
 
06:53:51.910 --> 06:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and and that has changed and and this
 
06:53:53.830 --> 06:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
really is the the budget cycle to make
 
06:53:56.430 --> 06:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
this a permanent necessary feature um of
 
06:54:00.150 --> 06:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the commission um so fiscal year 25 uh
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
allocated almost $2,800 school year 26
 
06:54:07.150 --> 06:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
asked for 72 uh ,000 it's that's about a
 
06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
$45,000 change so that that's what the
 
06:54:11.548 --> 06:54:11.558 align:start position:0%
biggest thing you will see in looking at
 
06:54:15.350 --> 06:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
this budget um regarding other Personnel
 
06:54:17.868 --> 06:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
expense fiscal year 26 efficiency budget
 
06:54:20.388 --> 06:54:20.398 align:start position:0%
reflects a loss of 5 hours per week of
 
06:54:23.230 --> 06:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
part-time assistance this is a signif
 
06:54:25.750 --> 06:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
significant loss in a in a very small
 
06:54:27.708 --> 06:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
office reviewing the remaining
 
06:54:29.388 --> 06:54:29.398 align:start position:0%
non-personnel parts of the fiscal year
 
06:54:32.750 --> 06:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
26 budget in comparison to 25 um um the
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
increases except for class 46 the
 
06:54:37.708 --> 06:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
consultant line um are largely the cost
 
06:54:40.110 --> 06:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
of keeping the lights on and and not
 
06:54:42.670 --> 06:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
controllable um instate and out of uh
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
State travel in fact were reduced uh
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
Pages 20 uh um 212 and 200 and um 216
 
06:54:53.110 --> 06:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
display how the decreases um to budget
 
06:54:54.868 --> 06:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
lines were made where they were possible
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:54:58.270 --> 06:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
made um the increase in the consultant
 
06:55:00.030 --> 06:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
line is to make the commission compliant
 
06:55:02.990 --> 06:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
with Federal Regulation and the Ada
 
06:55:04.590 --> 06:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
um our meetings are public and
 
06:55:07.430 --> 06:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
communication access is a requirement we
 
06:55:08.948 --> 06:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
have members of the public who attend
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
who are deaf and uh for whom ASL English
 
06:55:14.628 --> 06:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
interpreters are needed uh given our
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
audience many of whom use hearing aids
 
06:55:19.830 --> 06:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh cart reporting whereby spoken word is
 
06:55:22.030 --> 06:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
typed and viewed on uh uh available
 
06:55:23.628 --> 06:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
displayed in real time on a screen is
 
06:55:26.310 --> 06:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
needed as well that's about uh
 
06:55:30.230 --> 06:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
$7500 um per year for that um
 
06:55:33.468 --> 06:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
purpose um fiscal year 26 and 27 budgets
 
06:55:36.110 --> 06:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
are not flat but nearly so uh even with
 
06:55:39.030 --> 06:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
required salary increases and to achieve
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
that um the dollars for communication
 
06:55:42.868 --> 06:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
access services that I just mentioned
 
06:55:45.388 --> 06:55:45.398 align:start position:0%
were moved into the prioritized need uh
 
06:55:48.030 --> 06:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
request for fiscal year 27 so just
 
06:55:50.350 --> 06:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
quickly moving to the prioritized need
 
06:55:53.948 --> 06:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
um budget uh items uh top of the list is
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
for communication access services to be
 
06:55:57.948 --> 06:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Americans Disability
 
06:56:02.030 --> 06:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
Act um that is um um there's a request
 
06:56:05.430 --> 06:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
for 2500 in fiscal year 26 and 6,000 in
 
06:56:07.310 --> 06:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 please note that there
 
06:56:09.430 --> 06:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
was a zero that was dropped um in the
 
06:56:11.948 --> 06:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
budget book on pages 2011 203 and
 
06:56:15.070 --> 06:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
219 um it again it's the request is not
 
06:56:17.230 --> 06:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
for 600 but for for
 
06:56:20.750 --> 06:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um in that prioritized need um
 
06:56:22.388 --> 06:56:22.398 align:start position:0%
the second request is for additional
 
06:56:24.708 --> 06:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
staff uh for the commission to have the
 
06:56:27.230 --> 06:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
desired impact one full-time staff that
 
06:56:29.628 --> 06:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
is running running essentially an agency
 
06:56:32.468 --> 06:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
on its own is not enough um the ratio of
 
06:56:35.070 --> 06:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
administrative work that I do um to
 
06:56:37.230 --> 06:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
Mission oriented work uh tilts against
 
06:56:38.708 --> 06:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
achieving the purpose for why the
 
06:56:41.910 --> 06:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
commission was was created um and if and
 
06:56:43.230 --> 06:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
if I'm being a little transparent I'm
 
06:56:44.910 --> 06:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
actually retiring before the year is out
 
06:56:46.708 --> 06:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
and in part of that is is is a bit of
 
06:56:48.910 --> 06:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
burnout um from trying to start up an
 
06:56:50.430 --> 06:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
agency during a
 
06:56:54.788 --> 06:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic and and just the the um uh the
 
06:56:56.510 --> 06:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
amount of work that's involved in in the
 
06:56:59.030 --> 06:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
role a policy an analyst with the
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
ability to study the state budget will
 
06:57:02.990 --> 06:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
make an outsized impact uh to the
 
06:57:04.750 --> 06:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure difference in the quality
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
and in the breadth of the work that the
 
06:57:09.270 --> 06:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
commission is able to address um and it
 
06:57:10.628 --> 06:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
would create the opportunity for the
 
06:57:12.868 --> 06:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
next executive director to be able to do
 
06:57:14.830 --> 06:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
to um do things such as writing Grant
 
06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
proposals to bring in additional
 
06:57:18.030 --> 06:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
resources to the
 
06:57:20.590 --> 06:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
state uh item number three on the
 
06:57:23.030 --> 06:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
prioritized need list is to maintain the
 
06:57:25.430 --> 06:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
current parttime employees hours at 20
 
06:57:27.788 --> 06:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
hours a week versus the reduction um
 
06:57:29.270 --> 06:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
even if we're not able in this budget
 
06:57:31.070 --> 06:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
cycle to get an additional staff person
 
06:57:33.590 --> 06:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
here maintain ping current staff levels
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
would would be so helpful um and that is
 
06:57:41.230 --> 06:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
about um 8,800 in uh State fiscal year
 
06:57:44.910 --> 06:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
26 and about 8,900 inisis uh State
 
06:57:48.468 --> 06:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 um item number four is
 
06:57:51.030 --> 06:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
for is about is $1,000 per fiscal year
 
06:57:53.310 --> 06:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
for subscription services to support
 
06:57:55.270 --> 06:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
communication uh engagement and
 
06:57:57.990 --> 06:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
Communications activities these dollars
 
06:57:59.548 --> 06:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
are just a hedge against the need to
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
hire outside for services um and and um
 
06:58:06.468 --> 06:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
which would cost more and the final item
 
06:58:09.150 --> 06:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
on the prioritized needs list um also is
 
06:58:11.350 --> 06:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
is an increase in inter agency transfers
 
06:58:13.468 --> 06:58:13.478 align:start position:0%
uh for class 28 property and plant as
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%

application of dop administrative

established in 1986 as a qualified

independent panel appointed by the GNC
 
07:00:20.510 --> 07:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of RSA 21i col 45

uh

07:00:34.030 --> 07:00:34.040 align:start position:0%

periodic business
 
07:00:54.430 --> 07:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
meetings historically the PAB has been a
 
07:00:57.468 --> 07:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
component of the division of personnel
 
07:01:00.830 --> 07:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
until the upcoming 2627 budget we have
 
07:01:04.788 --> 07:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
relied on the staff and resources of dop
 
07:01:07.310 --> 07:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
in order to function the past
 
07:01:10.388 --> 07:01:10.398 align:start position:0%
legislative session Senate Bill
 
07:01:14.110 --> 07:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
487 which establishes the PAB as a
 
07:01:16.708 --> 07:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
wholly independent state agency was
 
07:01:19.670 --> 07:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
passed thus we are coming before you
 
07:01:21.948 --> 07:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
with our first budget as an independent
 
07:01:21.958 --> 07:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
with our first budget as an independent
state

07:01:23.990 --> 07:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:01:27.388 --> 07:01:27.398 align:start position:0%
agency um in the interest of brevity I
 
07:01:29.830 --> 07:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
am going to skip the brief section
 
07:01:32.270 --> 07:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
around transition activities just know
 
07:01:36.468 --> 07:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
that we are transitioning out of admin
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
services to become our own agency and
 
07:01:43.030 --> 07:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
are analyzing our needs um and
 
07:01:44.990 --> 07:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
particularly budget priorities in order
 
07:01:47.230 --> 07:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
to do
 
07:01:51.670 --> 07:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
that our budget request for uh fiscal
 
07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:02.000 --> 07:02:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

07:02:04.750 --> 07:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:04.760 --> 07:02:06.548 align:start position:0%
 
$334,700

07:02:06.548 --> 07:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
$334,700
 
07:02:09.388 --> 07:02:09.398 align:start position:0%
those figures are well within the
 
07:02:12.430 --> 07:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
perameters that were provided to us uh
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
by the governor's
 
07:02:18.670 --> 07:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
office uh the PAB budget essentially
 
07:02:22.468 --> 07:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
requests routine uh operating expenses
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
including part-time staff rental space
 
07:02:30.430 --> 07:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
current expenses it licenses and board
 
07:02:34.468 --> 07:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
expenses uh for fiscal year 2026 you'll
 
07:02:37.110 --> 07:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
notice that our first year of the buyan
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
name is a little higher than the second
 
07:02:42.230 --> 07:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
year that is because we um have budgeted
 
07:02:46.070 --> 07:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
some one-time costs that will not need
 
07:02:48.868 --> 07:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
to be replicated in the second year
 
07:02:52.070 --> 07:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
those costs include simple things like
 
07:02:55.468 --> 07:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
um computers uh software systems that
 
07:02:59.388 --> 07:02:59.398 align:start position:0%
sort of thing um so with that that's a
 
07:03:01.590 --> 07:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
fairly simple budget compared to what
 
07:03:04.830 --> 07:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
you heard um already today and I will
 
07:03:04.840 --> 07:03:11.310 align:start position:0%
you heard um already today and I will
entertain

07:03:11.310 --> 07:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:13.990 --> 07:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions I'll just note for people that
 
07:03:18.070 --> 07:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
um how this happened um people probably
 
07:03:20.590 --> 07:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
know that um in the in the late 50s
 
07:03:22.990 --> 07:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
early 60s they created a Personnel
 
07:03:25.750 --> 07:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
commission with a executive director who
 
07:03:28.430 --> 07:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't be fired and a and a board of
 
07:03:31.830 --> 07:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
directors um in 1986 after ad admin
 
07:03:33.430 --> 07:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
ministrative Services was created out of
 
07:03:36.430 --> 07:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
edmin and control they merged the that
 
07:03:39.868 --> 07:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel Commission in made the
 
07:03:43.270 --> 07:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
activities of the of the department um
 
07:03:46.110 --> 07:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel and decided to
 
07:03:47.868 --> 07:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
take what used to be the board of the
 
07:03:50.030 --> 07:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel commission and turned it into
 
07:03:52.388 --> 07:03:52.398 align:start position:0%
the Personnel appeals board which used
 
07:03:53.430 --> 07:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
07:03:57.468 --> 07:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
appeals um for since 1986 it's been a
 
07:04:00.190 --> 07:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
little bit awkward in that the people
 
07:04:02.670 --> 07:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
making Appeals
 
07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
are usually us to a board to which we're
 
07:04:09.670 --> 07:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
providing support which some people
 
07:04:11.628 --> 07:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
would argue is legally a conflict of
 
07:04:14.110 --> 07:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
interest um and at some point starting
 
07:04:16.510 --> 07:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
about two years ago we created a process
 
07:04:21.230 --> 07:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
to um make reality out of What's um or
 
07:04:22.788 --> 07:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
to put down in writing what's actually
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
reality which is that it's not the same
 
07:04:28.990 --> 07:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
thing and I'm not the boss of you um and
 
07:04:30.868 --> 07:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
um I mean literally for example I can't
 
07:04:33.150 --> 07:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
talk to Charlie after the meeting even
 
07:04:34.110 --> 07:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
though he's a friend of mine because I
 
07:04:36.150 --> 07:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
have an appeal before him and it would
 
07:04:38.670 --> 07:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
be awkward um to do so and so we're
 
07:04:41.468 --> 07:04:41.478 align:start position:0%
doing this that their budget happens to
 
07:04:43.788 --> 07:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
be exactly the fiscal note of the piece
 
07:04:46.190 --> 07:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation that was passed which
 
07:04:49.230 --> 07:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
seems which I suspect is why James gave
 
07:04:54.670 --> 07:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:56.350 --> 07:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
Target thank you very much for your
 
07:04:58.910 --> 07:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
testimony greatly appreciate it thank
 
07:05:02.270 --> 07:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
you and with that the hearing stand
