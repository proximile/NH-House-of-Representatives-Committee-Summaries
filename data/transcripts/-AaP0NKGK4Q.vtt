what
 
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
all right I will call to order the laps
 
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.469 align:start position:0%
all right I will call to order the laps
extension

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh our our role is to make
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
sure that the back part of House Bill 25
 
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
is exactly correct and to identify money
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
that can be repurposed that is that is
 
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
left over from lapsed lapsed uh line
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
items uh there's a couple ways I can do
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
this we can blaze through it or I can go
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
a little more slow and explain how I do
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
what I do cuz there are some people who
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
think that I'm a wizard for knowing how
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
to do this but my goal would be to have
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
you all understand how I do
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
mind I think it would be because some of
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
us are new some of us aren't as new but
 
00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
your wisdom is is uh if we can just get
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
a tenth of your wisdom on what you're
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
doing I think we would all benefit from
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
this as we move forward in the future
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
all right that's what I was hoping for
 
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
so let's take a look at House Bill 25
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
year and if you look in your your brown
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
sleeve in the LBA orientation that we
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
had on the very first day there is a
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
2023 House Bill
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
25 and that starts on its page
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
18 and that's interesting when we come
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
to how did I create this sheet that I've
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
been working
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
from so hous
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
25 appropriates anything that is going
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
to be funded by
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
bonding the operating budget is things
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
that are appropriated out
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
of plain old money now the debt service
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
for the bonds is paid out of the general
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
fund or the highway fund or some other
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
fund but the Appropriations are in House
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
fill 25 so if we look at the beginning
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
after the enacting
 
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 align:start position:0%
Clause uh section
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
one section one is all of the
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that typically are
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
General funded but it also includes the
 
00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
General funded but it also includes the
federal

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
funded which are not bonded because we
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
just ask the federal government to send
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
to and then there are like fish and game
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
has their own fund and the Liquor
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
Commission has their own fund so if you
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
were to look at for
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
example uh the fish and game department
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
that starts on page two
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh you've got an appropriation for
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
Hatchery Predator control and then less
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
other funds so and then the net state is
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
zero and then there's a footnote that
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
starts on line 14 that directs the
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
treasure to issue the bonds uh and The
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
Debt Service from the fish and game fund
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
and the same would be true of the liquor
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
fund yes could you give us a minute to
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
you well you can look at the previous
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital 25 Mr Mr chair May if I can
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation Mr
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
Shay this capital budget worksheet that
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
you put together is is in essence
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what he's talking
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
about that's well right at the moment
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the beginning of house
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
25 that worksheet starts at the laps
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
extension part okay which is which is
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
what this committee is Char I'm sort of
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
explaining how how the first part is put
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
together well this is Hospital 25 from
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
this year in in that LBA orientation
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
document starting on page 18 is Hospital
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
25 from the previous the previous time
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere we have this
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
year right right if if I might I think
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
what the chair chairman Jack's trying to
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
provide to the uh subcommittee is that
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
how House Bill 25 is structured so it
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which one you're looking
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
at at this moment he just wants to
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
explain to you what the section one does
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
and then what the laps extensions do and
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
then the document that representative
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mills um held up is all the laps
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
extensions that were in the governor's
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
int um proposed capital budget and were
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh essentially included in the house
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
bill 25 is introduced for
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
2025 great so section one is going to be
 
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
the general funded and other funded and
 
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.710 align:start position:0%
the general funded and other funded and
federal

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and at the beginning it
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
says the sums are hereby
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
appropriated now in section in um part
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
two on starting on page four are the
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
items now the Constitution says says
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the highway fund can only be be
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
expended for the construction
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance or supervision of
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
Highways and also because the department
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
of safety collects the highway fund
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to charge the expenses
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
of collecting it to the highway
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
fund and they call that cost of
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
collections so if they say they're going
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
to fund something out of cost of
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
collections it's
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
deceptive because
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at the at the
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
money before it goes into the highway
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
fund as opposed to the money being
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated after it's already gotten
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
into the highway
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
fund so once in a while they're say this
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
is not this is not affecting the highway
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
fund because it's appropriated out of
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
cost of collections but that's just
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
simply are you inside the door or
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
outside the door so we wouldn't fall for
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
that okay so section two is exactly the
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
same as section one except that their
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
Highway fund The Debt Service on the
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
bonds will come from the highway
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
fund now then you get
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
into so in section three which starts on
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
line seven says how we're going to fund
 
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.910 align:start position:0%
line seven says how we're going to fund
those

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and it says the treasur
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
to well section three says that the
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
agencies are allowed to expand the funds
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
provided what we want them to do for
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
example if it says police standards and
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
training main enterance security
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
improvements we don't want them to spend
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
that on air conditioning they're
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to spend the appropriation on
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose that's in the
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill now sometimes an agency will come
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
and say we have money left over we want
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
to use it for this and that happen
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
several times in the agency
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
presentations and we'll come to how we
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
so now in section
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
four the community colleges and the
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
university system have their own Board
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
of Trustees so even though we give them
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
money it's not quite the same as giving
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections money
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
because they have their own border of
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
Trustees that controls the expenditure
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
of that money so in essence we block
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
grant them the money hoping that they
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
will spend it on what it's been
 
00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.629 align:start position:0%
will spend it on what it's been
appropriated

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
for but we don't have as much control
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
over them because they have their own
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and Mr Shay if you
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
want to jump in anywhere and and the
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
university system need the approval of
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
their Board of Trustees to expend the
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation that the um legislature
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
has provided through the capital budget
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's the purpose of sections um
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
four and five right so section four and
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
five basically explain
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
that uh for the community colleges and
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
University system the board of trustees
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
is actually who's expending the funds as
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
opposed to one of the more normal state
 
00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:38.430 align:start position:0%
opposed to one of the more normal state
agencies

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you so when they spoke to
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
us the other day about specific funding
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
for specific buildings like they did at
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and they did at Kean like the
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
Elliott they're deferring and they're
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
doing some other work in other locations
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
so that's their complete choice we just
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
grant them certain dollar amounts for
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
funds to do the work that they feel is
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
responsible so in reality we're not
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
really responsible for for any kind of
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
control on that but it could just be
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
that we we let them know what our
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
concerns are about not funding things
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we specifically funded for is that
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
the case so they can still even though
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking them a ton of questions the
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
other day about specific buildings and
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
why they're doing that in reality they
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
have the choice to do that regardless is
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
that true well for example on line 18
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
for the community colleges it says for
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
the completion of the project
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
enumerated right so they're supposed to
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
spend the money on the project
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
enumerated which is whatever building it
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
is okay so you were going to mention
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
some thank no I was just going to rep
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
some Jack said it basically they've
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
identified the projects that they would
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
like the legislature to provide funding
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
for those are the projects they to use
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the money for they need to get their um
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees to approve the
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
expenditure of that money after the
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation has been provided through
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
a capital budget so they would be doing
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
the three uh three campuses the each of
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
the buildings they identified for each
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
of those campuses that would be what the
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
money would be spent on um what they've
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
asked for this from this committee the
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
day they presented was to have some
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility they would still do those
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
projects but to move the the money as
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
they did with um hide Hall they put more
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
towards that than they did the other
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
projects because they um determined that
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
was a better return on value for that
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
campus at that point but they still want
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
to do the other
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
projects Mr chairman so so I I just want
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand this right
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
with the lapse situation so why we're
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
doing it so in reality um they ask for
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the money for specific projects so it's
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to review those
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
projects in detail but when they come
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
back for instance for laps funding they
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
may have spent money on a different
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
scope on the no yeah they're not
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to do they would have spent it
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
on those buildings they identified it
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
just maybe the timing of when they do
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
the project for that building so they
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
have in the case that you just saw
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
presented to you they had two buildings
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
that were part of a three Bia
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation they front loaded one of
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
those buildings more than they had
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
originally proposed and put less towards
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the second building but they're still
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
going to do both projects okay all right
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's clear so then I want to
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
just make sure so with the laps funding
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
those the the funding that they they've
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
got in their in their laps extensions
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
should be directly in line with what
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
they' done for those specific projects
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
and that we'd approved correct yeah yes
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
right except University system didn't
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
have any lapse extensions community
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
college did right when we get to okay
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
when we get down there actually we're
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
almost there that's section 13 on page
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
six uh I'll explain why we have lapse
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
extensions um
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
so on on page five in section 7 this is
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
how we're going to fund the
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and it authorizes the
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
treasurer to
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
borrow an amount of money that's equal
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
to whatever the general fund total is
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
the highway fund total and the other
 
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
the highway fund total and the other
funds

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
total so that's what authorizes the
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
treasurer to to borrow the
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
money that's identified in sections one
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of this down to so the
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
rest of it is pretty much
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
boilerplate an important thing is the
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
section 12 where the division of Public
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
Works uh supervises the projects and
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's something called the federal
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
Davis bacon act that says prevailing
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
wage has to be paid for any federally
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
funded project and that's so that now
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
why is it that we have laps extensions
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
you've you've heard it said one
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
legislature can't find the
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
next and so we only appropriate
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
money for two
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
years where where's that where statutory
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's found in the RSA that's
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
in another statute so in another statute
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
it says that these these Appropriations
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
last until the end of that
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
vium and that's because one legislature
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
can't B the next now as we know
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
construction projects last can
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
potentially last for years and years and
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
years so in order to prevent losing that
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's why we have the
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
lapse extension section
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
and the first thing it says is the
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
following appreciations are hereby
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
extended to June 30th and if you look at
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
the very
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
end the effective
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
date of that
 
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.470 align:start position:0%
date of that
section

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
year's so the effective date would be
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
July 1
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
well the previous the previous one says
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
that the laps extension section takes
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
effect on June
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
30th um doesn't it have to do that for
 
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
repurpose so when you're repurposing you
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
do a hard lapse on things you don't want
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
to continue forward for June
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
30 but I'll I'll confirm that after done
 
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
30 but I'll I'll confirm that after done
here

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
looking yeah the previous the the uh
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
2023 version has section 24 which is the
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
laps extensions shall take effect June
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
30th and then the remainder shall take
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
effect July 1st and I think we need that
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
year's because it catches the lapse
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
before it lapses
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
correct so so that's a
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
mistake yes all right let me just go
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
through the notes that I
 
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.950 align:start position:0%
through the notes that I
so

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
so the the items in that laps extension
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
section are all the Appropriations that
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
were made in Prior years that we want to
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
have extended now there's a few things
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
that can happen one is we extend the
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation the agency says yeah we're
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
not done with the project we need the
 
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
not done with the project we need the
money

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
so that we check that off uh we can find
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
out that there's an appropriation that
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
was made in a prior year that isn't in
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
the new house bill
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
25 that can mean one of several things
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
done and the agency agrees that it's
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
done it's paid all of its bills and it
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
no longer needs that appropriation
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the normal way that an
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation would expire so then our
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
question is is there money left in that
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
line that we can use for something
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
else and it doesn't count against the
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
bonding Authority that the treasurer
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
recommended because it's already been
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
counted in the previous
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
here so it's already it's already
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
authorized but an issued
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
debt it's already been bonded well it's
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
already been counted in the amount in
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
the debt if if you look at the
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
debt to revenue ratio that they're so
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
interested in it's already counted in
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
debt so we can use it again without it
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
counting against the what the treasurer
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
recommends yes what the treasurer
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommends is all for the new
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in section one and two so
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
I have another question on this so you
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned two things there you mentioned
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
one that if we find that there's
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't lapsed yet that
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's money left in a project that we
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
can reallocate that to a different
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
project we can reallocate it to anything
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
that we choose to reallocate it to okay
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's something I got to get used to if
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
you look in and that's one of the
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that I referred to the previous
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
Bill if you look in that middle section
 
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.669 align:start position:0%
Bill if you look in that middle section
where

00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the you know that's after that's in
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
between section one and
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
two you will find several
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
reallocations and
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
purposes so I just want to be clear on
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
this we can reallocate it because it's
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
already been appropriated within our
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
funding Authority for any project that
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
is is requested or we can we can we
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
could allocate to a project that wasn't
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
requested right okay so then the other
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
after the governor delivers the pink
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
book to us yeah that pink book the house
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
owns the budget until it passes the
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
budget and sends it to the Senate okay
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
and we can do whatever we like
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill we can amend it in any way
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay no the Constitution sets our salary
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
so so so then the other question that's
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
related to that is I just want to make
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the process again that
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
if the it's kind of the the the the
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
sequence of events we typically wouldn't
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
do anything with funding especially on
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
lap stuff unless the the particular
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
Department requested that money is that
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
not true well they know they're supposed
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
to know yeah the status of their project
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether they've let a contract whe
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
whether they have funds that they're
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
paying out on a contract uh and how much
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
is left in that appropriation they're
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep track of that uh so
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
they will know when the project when
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
they think the project is done they will
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
know when it's ongoing and if it's done
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh Mr sheay has access to the unexpended
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
has that's correct and so I don't know
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
if you have the um 23 House Bill 25 in
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
front of you by chance I don't think so
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
no well it's in this that's it's in this
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
document that was in your brown sleeve
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
to begin with so so repent Brown just to
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
kind of sum up what's happening is today
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
what you're doing in this subcommittee
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
is you're looking at the laps extensions
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the back of um the capital budget the
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
agencies have been presenting to this
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in full um what the status is
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
of their their projects and if they need
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
a lapse extension or not in some
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
instances they might have provided a
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
value of what they didn't
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
expend I will check that against the
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
statement of Appropriations to see if
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
that number matches up um and if it does
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
that amount becomes available to reuse
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
for another project that may has been
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
requested as in front of the full
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
committee so in Prior Capital budgets we
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
we call it
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
repurposing and you'll have this
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
committee will make a decision on we
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
want to fund a project a in the
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation in the
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
repurposing section we would take the
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
money left over from projects that were
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
done and use it for a new appropriation
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
for that department usually it's for a
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
project that they presented to the full
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee and that you've discussed and
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
come to some agreement on and all the
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
agreement is done on the full committee
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
basis it's not done by this subcommittee
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
so representative R if if you're looking
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
for for a timeline of this all the
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
presentations that we just heard today
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm this this past week those
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
are for this this current budget and
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
this current bonding when we get to the
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
end of everything when we look at the
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions these are for previous
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
ones from years past that they still
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
haven't spent all that money yet it's
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
taken that that long and so we have to
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
keep track of all the money that's still
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
out there when they finally do finish it
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
as as representative Jack said when when
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
the project is finally finished and
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
we've given them $100 for their project
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
and they've six years later they come to
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
us and go the project is done we only
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
spent 95 we got $5 over one of two
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
things will happen they'll either say
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
well we've we've got this other project
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
you gave us 104 we're going to spend
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to overspend by about $5
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
we'd like to repurpose this money for
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
that project or the other thing is that
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're good we've got nothing else to do
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
it on we're we're lapsing that money
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's back it's back to the committee
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's when the committee takes that
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
money and turns around and looks at
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
where we're currently at on hb25 the
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
current everybody is Christmas wish list
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we we add up all those little $5 and
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
$12 and $16 here and if we're I think
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
we're getting close back to
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
$649,000 that we will be able to we can
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
either repurpose at all and I don't
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
think it's ever been done but we can
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
turn it back into the we can turn it
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
back into the general fund if we wanted
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
to can we not it it would just be a
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
lapse so basically just clean the books
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
off so it doesn't help that way you just
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
answered one of the questions whether we
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
return that back or whether we use that
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
funding you know when we look at the
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget whether we say we
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
agree with all of this or
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
not we may or may not agree with it as
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay right so I I'm good with
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
that now I just want to make sure I
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
understood the sequence and the
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
authority we had as far as spending that
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
money or repurposing that money because
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not used to that as from my business
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
background so thank you one thing that
 
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
always happens is agencies will come in
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
and say the governor didn't fund this
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
but we think it's really important and
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of the menu of items that
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
we pick and choose when we have extra
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
money as to what to fund and not
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
fund um so the one last thing I want to
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
cover is so if we look at where it says
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriation made to Department of
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services in and then
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's the scoby cook and I want to
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
cover how to read
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
that uh so it says the appropriation
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
made Department administra Services in
 
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.269 align:start position:0%
made Department administra Services in
2023

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
113 colon 1 Roman 1 A1 for Courthouse
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
generators now if I go back to my 20123
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
25 uh it turns out so every time a bill
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
passes it gets through how a bill
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
becomes a law to the end it gets the it
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
gets assigned a chapter number so if I
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
went over to the State library and
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
pulled down the laws of
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
1967 there would be chapter one chapter
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
2 chapter 3 those are all the bills that
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
1967 and so
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh the H Bill 25 in 2023 is chapter 113
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
so if I went to the laws of 2023 it
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
would be chapter 113 would be the text
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill so the 2023 so
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
113 is the chapter number of laws of
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
2023 colon one is section one so that's
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's our section one that is the
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
general fund Capital
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and then a and then one
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
is the depart Roman one is the
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
Department of administative Services a
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
is Court facilities and number one is
 
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.909 align:start position:0%
is Court facilities and number one is
Courthouse

00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
Courthouse
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
generators so that whole expression
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
refers to that
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation and if you had the 2023
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hospital 25 in front of you you could
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
follow along and find that and then the
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
courthouse and then later on so now if
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
you get to if you go down below to
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
number nine you'll see that that was
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
made in 2021 chapter
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
107 extended by so now if you went to
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
the lapse extensions of 2023 you would
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
see section 24 is the laps extensions
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
number two and then it gives the purpose
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
again so that's how to read all these
 
00:31:00.639 --> 00:31:03.389 align:start position:0%
again so that's how to read all these
Goble

00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
Goble
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
references that's good that's good but I
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
guess my question is what do we actually
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
check on this do we actually go through
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
each of these Lin well we're going to do
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
that in a minute um so now if I go back
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
to I'm I'm going to I'm going to go
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
slightly out of my one of our purposes
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
is to identify money that we can use for
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
something else so I'm going to go
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
slightly out on my lane and mention that
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
during the agency presentation in
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
section one we determined that the
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey ringe CTE renovation did not so
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
we do not put an appropriation for a CTE
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
in on there's a local match required for
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
a for a for a
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
CTE and we learned on Tuesday that
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey and ringe did not
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
pass uh the bonding Authority that they
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
would need to supply their local match
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
for this appropriation
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
so and also Milford did not that's an
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
mail that Mr Shay sent out
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so the normal practice of
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
the committee would be to remove
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
that there is no CTE waiting in the
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
wings shovel
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
ready to take its place so that is $18.5
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
million that we will delete from the
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget because of
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
the failure of the town to appropriate
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
the failure of the town to appropriate
their

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.679 --> 00:32:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
reuse

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
reuse
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
well that's the only one I mentioned so
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
far mil oh well there was a Milford
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
Milford was the backup is is a is the
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
next school there's a rotation of CES
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
and Milford is the next one in line and
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
they're not ready either so there is no
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
school that is ready that could take the
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
place of this one so just to be clear
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
Milford is not listed milford's not here
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
it used to be it used to be that we
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
tried to do two per budget and they're
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
getting so expensive that that kind of
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
fills up the budget represent Jack if I
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
could just interject I think that we
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to refocus this subcommittee on
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
just the lapse extensions because you
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
haven't had public hearing have two more
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
comments on section one and then I'll
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
then then we'll do that okay so excuse
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
me just for education purposes me so
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
that money was originally set aside for
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
education for the CTE and again is that
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
$18 million is it similar to what we'd
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
spoken about before that we can
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
repurpose that money for anything or do
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
we do it within it's not appropriated
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
yet okay so we could use it to reduce
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
the amount that we're going to
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate right uh which we've
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
discussed the fact that the governor had
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
143 million and the treasurer
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
recommended somewhat less
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
so one thing that we might choose to do
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
is reduce the total amount that we're
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
bonding general fund bonding and we now
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
we have $18
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
million right off table uh at the top of
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
page two there was a typo on line to uh
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
the word replacement should be deleted
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
and at the end 51 should be
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
50 and and you had that I would
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
assume the Winn pasak River basin
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
control fund right but th those are
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
things that we would discuss at the full
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
committee not at this last exension and
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
then the judicial branch uh deleted
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
their so now we'll go to the laps
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
extensions now let me explain
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
so Mr Shay's worksheet only considers
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
the lapse extension section in the
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
current House Bill
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
25 the worksheet that I sent to you
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
before we started and I think Mr Shay
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
distributed you should have a copy of
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
both worksheets so mine looks like this
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
and as represent Jack has indicated this
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
is the capital projects that were in the
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
back of the governor's int uh proposed
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget that want to be extended
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
and were subsequently included in House
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 as introduced represent Jack's
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
document which he's holding up is just a
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
listing he took the laps extensions in
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
the capital budget for 2023 and he
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
compared that to what was in um 2025
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
right so the way I produce this is I go
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
2023 as as
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
enacted and I make a line for every
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation or extension in the 2023
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
version which and it's a lot easier if
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
you have the one from the budget
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
previous to that because the extensions
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
tend to be the same from year to year so
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
you'll notice
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
in my in my document that I've got the
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
2023 Appropriations and then 2021 those
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
were extensions that were in that budget
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
and this this means and then you apply
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers from this year's hosal 25
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the column to the right
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
so the first one is from 20 is the one I
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
just read out from uh for for Courthouse
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
generators that was that was the very
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
first appropriation in
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
2023 and it's been extended by number
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
one in this year's laps
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
extensions and so on now when
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
administrative Services was
 
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.109 align:start position:0%
administrative Services was
here

00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh the the the reason why that's helpful
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
is if you find one that's not
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
extended uh like for
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
example the Hillsboro County South
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
Cooling and controls is not mentioned in
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
this year and that's that's a case where
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
either the project is done or it's been
 
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.630 align:start position:0%
either the project is done or it's been
accidentally

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
accidentally
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
omitted and if it's accidentally omitted
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
we want to add it back so that they
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't lose their
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation now we had one we have one
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
case this year where the agency has
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
asked for an a lapsed value to be added
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
back and that's that's uh the former
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
Chairman's in under
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
the the Department of
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation it's number it's between
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
it would fall between 183 and
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
184 and the caption is Caroline stra
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
straford Freight rail improvements and
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
it would be 2023 Roman 15 number
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
three you I'm on well I don't have page
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
numbers on mine it's Department of
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation General funds it's the
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
last page it would be between 183 and
 
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.109 align:start position:0%
last page it would be between 183 and
184

00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
so the agency has requested that we add
 
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.190 align:start position:0%
so the agency has requested that we add
that

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
extension so that that those funds don't
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
lapse and they can continue to spend
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
them because without adding it back at
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the at the end of the fiscal
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
year in June that appropriation would
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
lapse if we don't do anything and they
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to further expend the
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation for Caroline straford
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
Freight rail improvements that was made
 
00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:28.990 align:start position:0%
Freight rail improvements that was made
in

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
23 yeah so I thought you said that this
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
had lapsed but it hasn't lapsed yet it
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
will lapse on June 30th so they didn't
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
unless it's mentioned in the laps
 
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
extension section of of this year's
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 once once the line has
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
lapsed it's done right well okay that's
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
un mention you you kind of there is a
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
loophole okay and that is if the agency
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
has encumbered the funds and you
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
probably know from the town what that is
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
you've signed a contract that obligates
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
you to pay the funds then they won't
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
lapse even if they're not
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned but it does preclude you from
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
contract did you want to add anything to
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah so some agencies do it
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
that way they just they don't they don't
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
laps extend their Appropriations and
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
method of having it not
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
lapse we typically would make sure that
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
was included
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
well we can I mean we would sort of
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
defer to how the agency wanted to do it
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
I personally recommend that it be
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
included because you never know when
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
something might come up and you might
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
need to sign a contract with a
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
plumber you know to do some to do a
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of additional work or
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
something like that in order get the
 
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
something like that in order get the
project

00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
done but that's just that's just my
 
00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:03.230 align:start position:0%
done but that's just that's just my
personal

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
personal
view

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
so I think so let's so do do you want to
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
go through um my document to start with
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
and I can just explain to the members
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
how I've structured
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
it uh sure if you want to do that so if
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at this document the long
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
sheet I think it's
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
18 pages long so it's all the laps
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
extensions like I said that were
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
proposed in the governor's capital
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
budget if it says okay in the column to
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the right that means the agency
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
confirmed that that laps extension is
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
correct and still needed yeah there's
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
24 if there's a question or um something
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen with that lapse
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
extension it'll be grayed out so if you
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
go to page
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
four U laps extension
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
um 49 I have that they don't need that
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
anymore so that they can um that will be
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
removed from this
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
list and if there's any bounces
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
remaining that would be repurposed I
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
have that there was
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
81,000 and that's not
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
$1,500 that was going to be repurposed
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
okay so that line has
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
81500 that we can use again so that's
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's one of our findings is that line
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
49 can be deleted and has $81,500
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
that we can use
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
again and that's it for the Department
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
of administrative services that I has
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
correct another question on that is
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
there a reason why we just put okay on
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
here and when we grade these out we
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
don't put the the dollar amount that's
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're considering laps so that we could
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
use this I have a separate sheet with
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
all that
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay see that here with that so that I
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
know as we're looking at it we can have
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
an idea what we're doing I have it all
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
right here for you okay thanks yeah and
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give that to you now I didn't
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
want to leave it on the table because it
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
I wanted to have an explanation for it
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
right because looking at it you might
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
not have understood what it was but
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so we've done our first
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
important piece of work we've we've
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
found money that can be lapsed that that
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
can be repurposed we found an item that
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
should be deleted and it has money in it
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
for so the next agency is agriculture
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
markets and food they responded by mail
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
they have one
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's from 21 and they
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
want to keep
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
it so for the agencies that responded
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
through an email you'll have a
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
three-page staple together document
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
it'll be handwritten the agency's name
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
and a highlight on it and that's just
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
their saying their comments to you
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
saying that yeah we need this laps
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
why so our next agency is Community
 
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:31.470 align:start position:0%
why so our next agency is Community
College

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
right I'm on my second page under
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
food and Jack which document are you
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
walking through
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
well I I I use my document because it
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
allows me to locate the items that are
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
lapsing I I would suggest to the members
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
that you use my document
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
well yeah because it it does show you
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
where there's things that are shaded out
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
and yeah maybe the difference rep of
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
Jack has notes on his document that's
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
why he's holding on to his right but I I
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
think it would be harder to go back and
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
forth between his document and this
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
document so just just an additional
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
point it's kind of interesting we get
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
about six different documents we shiting
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
back and forth from I'm looking at your
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
budget extension worksheet then you give
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
us this sheet here I don't know why it
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
could be Consolidated onto one sheet
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
which gave the dollar amounts and the
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
lapse extension information too just I
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't know why we go back and forth
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
through multiple documents it's it was a
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
timing thing with the documents I
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
finalized the one in your right hand
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon okay I had already
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
done this one I was still asking
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
agencies questions sometimes this
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
meeting occurs before we have all the
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
final information so we just identify
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
yet there's something coming I'm still
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
working with the agent gency okay I'll
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
just transfer these numbers to the sheet
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
thank you great I think I mean in the
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
end you don't really need to because
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's the document in your right hand is
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
the one that you're going to really be
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
more concerned about all right thank
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
you I have two lapses for the Community
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
College do we know one of them is for
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
2021 colon 14 critical maintenance one
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
is for the NCC engineering technology
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any money in
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
so unless it shows up on this sheet even
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
if the agency said they were done with
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
it and it was completed um there was no
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
money left unless it showed up on this
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
sheet that makes it
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
easy okay our next agency is Corrections
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
have the the agency got back to us with
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
wanting with uh some items that were in
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
house bu in the governor's version that
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
335 okay so item 64 we we want to delete
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
because that project is complete and it
 
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.030 align:start position:0%
because that project is complete and it
has

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
$335,000 of usable
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
money which is a nice find
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh number 65 they want to lapse and that
 
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
uh number 65 they want to lapse and that
has

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
zero and then 66 they want to lapse that
 
00:46:37.319 --> 00:46:38.430 align:start position:0%
zero and then 66 they want to lapse that
has

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
has
31141

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
31141
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
yep and then
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
67 they want to
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
lapse uh 64 65 and 66 were all that they
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to lapse oh so 67 they do not
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
okay and there's quite a number that are
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
not in hospital
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
have let's see so there's perimeter
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
2019 that would assume doesn't have any
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
money in it
 
00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:33.549 align:start position:0%
money in it
and

00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
then that's for from
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
2019 so
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
85,86 the one you're looking at is
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
19 so if you look on this single page oh
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah good so what what happens
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
with some agencies is they know the
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
Project's not going going to need the
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
labs extension but there is some bounce
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
left that's what is
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
reflected on the one pager in some
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
instances the lapse extension was
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
included in the proposed bill that's
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
what we're cleaning up they don't need
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
it so we're going to take it out in one
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
instance we have a case where the agency
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
said oops we really want that laps
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
extension let's add it back in which was
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation uh rail
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay so there's an item that you
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't find in housefield 25 because
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
it lapsed and there's
 
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.990 align:start position:0%
it lapsed and there's
85465

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
remaining in my on my document it's
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
72 yeah I know it's on the
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
right so we'll be able to use
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
that and there's replace electrical
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
services which has 267 we wouldn't
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
bother with I would assume because I've
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
added that one in to try to get to the
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
um the final number is 6495 and then
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
8308 yeah from 17
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
yep and just for completeness
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
that dra
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
from yeah so you have
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
um you have the trades building for
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
335,000 it's a 2021 project you have the
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
roof replacement for the nnh hcf which
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
is a for
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
21387 which is a 2021 capital
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation you have the door
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
controller upgrade for the Department of
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections for 31,1 141 which is also a
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
um 2021 appropriation and the last 2021
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation was the replacement of the
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
6,183 the next correction projects come
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
from the 2019 capital budget that was
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
they replace electrical services for
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
267 and then the last two projects from
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
Corrections are from the 2017 capital
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
budget for the body alarms of
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
43534 and then the transitional work
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
center um bathroom replacements for
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
$838 so that that accounts for all the
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh lapses that would come from the
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections so does everyone understand
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
how this is working good yes okay and
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that was a pretty fertile Agency
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
for getting money back if if I can just
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
interject for for the new members in the
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
past this committee met like this and it
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
was separate it was just like when we
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
went through all the agencies coming in
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
and and they they would then present our
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
laps extensions that's that's how
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative Jack developed his own
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
little system here on doing this because
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
you had to refer you had to have all the
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
sheets to refer to it and everything
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
else and we wouldn't know any of these
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
numbers until the end of today and we'd
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
sit there and go through all and it
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be an all day thing uh Mr Shay
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
came up with the genius idea when we
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
started to schedule all this that said
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
let's bring them in and get the laps
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
extensions at the same time they make
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
the regular presentation so he has done
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
all this background work that this
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
committee used to have to do and shorten
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
it up into uh these these documents so
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
you you've got the full explanation from
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
representative Jack on of how this whole
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
thing works and we'll thank Mr Shay for
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the shortcuts on all this stuff
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we would be here till
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
good 4:30 5 o'clock so now it's easier
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
to just skim through all this and double
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
our next agency is
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
education and we have money
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
in uh right before
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
73 uh pre-engineering technology has
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
continuing our next agency is energy and
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
they have two that are continuing they
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.309 align:start position:0%
 
Services

00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
$3,274 and that's one that we should be
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
3274 and everything else in
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services was
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
up and then fishing game has three items
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
and then Health and Human Services we
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
had to send them back with
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
homework to go through these and which
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
respond question yeah thank you Mr
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
chairman why is on your sheet CR why is
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
one 10 shaded but it says
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
okay it should have said completed
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's my error okay so it should be
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's completed it's going to be deleted
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay perfect thank you and also with um
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services if you turn to
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
114 and 116 those are shaded and marked
 
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.270 align:start position:0%
114 and 116 those are shaded and marked
as

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
completed Health and Human Services got
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
back to me um later yesterday after I
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
produced these documents and said that
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
they made an error and that they would
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
like lapse extensions to continue for
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
those two projects okay so which one of
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
those again uh 114 and 116 thank you so
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
those are going to be kept not
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
deleted and and
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
115 should
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
lapse that's correct okay 110 111 112
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
and 115 should be deleted from the um
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
lapse extension
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
list and it looks
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
like the only one
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
money it doesn't say that was going to
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
be question 112 and 115 waiting on a
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
final invoice do we have any idea if
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to be flat or they'll be uh
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's no they don't plan on have
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
anything left over in those accounts the
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
um $1,800 was the um 2021 beas systems
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
modernization that's number 110 in the
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
bill but we're going to delete that so
 
00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
in in HHS we're deleting 110
 
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.630 align:start position:0%
in in HHS we're deleting 110
111

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
111
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
112 we're keeping 114 at their request
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
we're yeah you no we're
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
keeping sorry I apologize go ahead is
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
that right yep you're right we're
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
keeping 114 we're deleting 115 and we're
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
keeping 116 at their request and then uh
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
the only one that has money of any of
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
so are
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
we are we all correct on on that
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
and what I have is that they wanted to
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
lapse 124
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct and there's no balance to
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
that with zero and everything else was
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
correct there on on the one pager sheet
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
there was a project that they um they
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
were lapsing from 2019 related to cyber
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
oh so that
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
52

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
5256 on my sheet that's between 122 and
 
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:59.549 align:start position:0%
5256 on my sheet that's between 122 and
123

00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
so so represent Brown that's another
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
reason why it doesn't all show up on
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
there all right so the courts had three
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
projects uh there were 125 126 and 127
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
and Hospital
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
25 and they got back to us by mail and
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
they say they would like to
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
money is that right that's correct and
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
then the money in 120 they're going to
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
they provided text for us that where
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
they would repurpose 125 and
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
127 within their own Department This Is
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
Not Unusual when an agency has money
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
left over that they want to keep it and
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
they will propose a project within their
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
own Department
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
to repurpose it to so I had forwarded to
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
the committee the email from the courts
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
related to these three projects um the
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
two projects that they want to extend
 
00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:08.510 align:start position:0%
two projects that they want to extend
are

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
ecort and they would like to change the
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
title of the project from ecourt to
 
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.630 align:start position:0%
title of the project from ecourt to
ecourt

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
ecourt
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
and Associated critical infrastructure
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
so the ecort was a very um narrowly
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
focused project as they've um gotten
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
into it understood that there's other
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
electronics or Communications that need
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be updated so that they can continue
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
to process these files that they use
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the ecourt system um so they
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
were hoping the committee would consider
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
that um when you meet next week or the
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
week after when you start to make final
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
decisions it doesn't have to happen but
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
it is a request of the judicial branch
 
00:59:51.029 --> 00:59:51.039 align:start position:0%
and um they'd be willing to come meet
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
with the committee um next week or
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
whenever the chair would like if if they
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
would like that at all do we have a
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
dollar chair
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
AI sure do we have a dollar value
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
assigned to 125 and
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
127 that is
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh so we can make that
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
decision yeah um so it's $1.3 million
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
just over that is that between the two
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
the two yeah so it's 1.3 million 1
 
01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:35.430 align:start position:0%
the two yeah so it's 1.3 million 1
37

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
3 and I misspoke when I said they didn't
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
have money in Project 126 it's actually
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
on the one pager at the top of the line
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
635 6035
 
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.870 align:start position:0%
635 6035
on

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
126 so on on my document those two
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
projects are grayed out not because they
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
the laps extension will go away but
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's been a request related to that
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
specific laps uh extension so if the
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
committee were to um agree to the
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
request I would have to go into the laps
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
extension and change the title so this
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
laps extension would go from ecort to
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
the new name to whatever the new name
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
becomes if it is the um what they
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
recommend or ask for which is the um
 
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
Associated critical INF and Associated
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure then that would
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
be amending this lapse extension title
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
to reflect that if I'm not mistaken we
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
have to actually go back to the 2021
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
house B 25 and amend the appropriation
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
so and then extend it yeah with the
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
title so what I've spoken to the chair
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
about is um putting together the
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
requests that these agencies are making
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
in this manner and providing that to the
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee if the committee wants to see
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
it next week or the week after whenever
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
you have your work sessions um so that
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can see exactly what would be
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
changing but when an agency requests to
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
change a title of a project that had
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
been appropriated in a previous capital
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
budget we actually amend the previous
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
capital budget to reflect that title and
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
then you have to amend the lapse
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
extension to have the new title and in
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
the current capital budget you'd have a
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
section that does all that and and you
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
would also say as amended by this act
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes yep
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
yep or we can choose to take to
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
1.3 million and repurpose it to another
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
project I would um before the I would
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
suggest that you would talk to the
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and have them come in to
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
explain there is still some ecort
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
specific functions that they're doing
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
but there's some other pieces to the
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
outside of that and I think in the email
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
I sent they gave you some examples some
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
explanation of it right and and they
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
Associated some cost with some of the
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
things that they are currently doing
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
related to ecort and some of the
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
expanded things that they would like to
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
do but it's not um everything yet um
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's one of those situations was as they
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
move further in this project they've
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
been doing ecort since 2012 I think is
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
when they got the first appropriation so
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
this has been a very um long standing
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
project trying to get all the courts
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
connected trying to get all the ability
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
to move information back and forth
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
fluidly between the courts the people
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
who use the courts um and as Things
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
become new and as new things are created
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
and old Things become obsolete they have
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
come up with some new challenges so they
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
were just seeing if there was a
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
possibility to to extend the title so
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
the I say all that it's a long-winded
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
explanation to say there probably isn't
 
01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:51.950 align:start position:0%
explanation to say there probably isn't
$1.3

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
$1.3
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
million they still need some of that to
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
do the ecourt and if they're still do in
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
the ecourt we wouldn't lapse it but you
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change the title so they would
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
be very narrowly focused
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
still right yeah this also
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
is they so that people can
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
electronically file cases instead of
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
having to file them on paper at a
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
courthouse so so if I might I just I
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand so
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is typical that since this is all
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
related the ecort and the associated
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support the ecort this
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be typical so will they give us
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
some type of summary on that so that we
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
understand we can make so we can make
 
01:04:31.359 --> 01:04:32.230 align:start position:0%
understand we can make so we can make
the

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
connection somewhere I'm not looking for
 
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.309 align:start position:0%
connection somewhere I'm not looking for
any

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:42.510 align:start position:0%
 
paperwork

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.190 align:start position:0%
paperwork
okay

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.870 align:start position:0%
okay
oh

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you knew this was G to come well I
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
suspected but I made plenty of copies
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
for everybody here as well as the
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we we talked about this ahead of we
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
talked about this ahead of time normally
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
this would be something also brought up
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the committee because we we Public
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
Works and highways we are the oversight
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
to all this so we don't let them do
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
whatever they want if they've got a
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
change and it's justifiable
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
we we're the check in balance and we
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
but again it's not a decision for here
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's just to let you know why that was
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
grayed out and that the request was made
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that the full
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
committee would full committee will
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
discuss will discuss after the public
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
here is for the fact finding to go so
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
far as to say they want to repurpose on
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
these lines and then we report that back
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
correct our next agency is liquor and
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
everything was good but it's liquor
 
01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.750 align:start position:0%
everything was good but it's liquor
funds

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
so uh there it doesn't help us with any
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
general fund item right and I I put out
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
a long sheet it looks like a
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that was their response back
 
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.990 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that was their response back
to

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
me yep and to repm Jack's point because
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
it is using liquor
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
funds whether they have money to lapse
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
or not it doesn't help the committee
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
with repurposing unless there was a
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
liquor project requested there was not
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
Affairs oh sorry so can you explain that
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
it just goes away to me what you
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
mean funding is just basically gone it's
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
gone it just lapses back to the the
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
liquor fund so if there's it's it's all
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get you reused for anything
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stay on the books it gets
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and and zeroed out so that's
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's not carried going forward in the
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
state financials thanks
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
in military
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs everything was good uh they did
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
send later uh items 138 139 and 143 they
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
slightly that's that's another case of
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
where the agency's requesting to change
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
the title of the
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
projects um they indicated to you the
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
committee when they were before the full
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
committee that um in trying to get some
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds they needed to
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
change the
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh project Focus to make them more
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
competitive with the process that's used
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
to get those funds um the three the
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
three projects two of them are full 100%
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
Federal fund one of them it's a $4
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
million project of which a million
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
dollars is General funds um to match
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's a 7525 match and um so that was
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
their request it's it relates to the
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
Pembrook um site to to expand some of
 
01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:53.829 align:start position:0%
Pembrook um site to to expand some of
the

01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
uses and again I have a I'll have a an
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
example of an amendment to provide to
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
the committee if it's something that the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
committee as a full is interested in
 
01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
committee as a full is interested in
looking

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
at so can you explain this to me so it
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
says request to repurpose would need to
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
update laps extension language what is
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
right so what I explained earlier if the
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee were to agree to the title
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
change I would need to make sure that
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
that laps extension title changed along
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
with it just language on well well we
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
also have to go back to the original
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation and change that title
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
right and then it can and then it can
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
right and then it can and then it can
lapse

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
forward yep yeah if you look in the 2023
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of examples of doing
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
that I think if when we finish up with
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the laps extensions themselves I'm
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
happily sit for a few minutes with
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants to talk some
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
more no no just I think this is not slow
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
at all this takes a long time to get
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
used to so you're everyone here is a
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
quick study
 
01:08:58.349 --> 01:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
um it's probably worth uh there's a
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
couple of land items here it's probably
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
worth mentioning the reason we hold
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
those it's kind of a reserve fund to buy
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
land the reason why is any uh military
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
construction has to be on state land and
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes the the dod will come and say
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have this project we want to do in
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
some town triester but and so we want
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
you to buy this land so they have to
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
have the money
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
so that's why they keep in reserve these
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
item these land items so that if they
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
get a we don't have to wait the full two
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
2017 and just a point I'd like to make
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
typically when we're trying to come up
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
with these uh values for repurposing I
 
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
don't look for things less than
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000 except when we're I'm trying to
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
get to a number in this case we we were
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
at 649 just over 649 so I grabbed a
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
couple of um
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
um smaller projects to bump it as high
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
could but I didn't grab the one and2
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
projects that were out there so all
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
right so everything on dncr matched
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
$382 so unless anyone has a question on
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
PDA actually came to us and they had uh
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
three Appropriations for the Turning
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
oops and then police standards and
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
training came to
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
theirs interestingly we have we have a
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
repurpose in a 2024 bill hb10
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
210 uh you skipped over
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
safety uh well I put it in alphabetical
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
oh so that was it that's at 208 209 and
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
210 and they want to keep those three
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
laps they want keep so it's interesting
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
to note that in 2024 House Bill
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
1043 repurposed the
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
210 yeah uh they had come in with a bill
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
before this committee right yep that
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often but if you're
 
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often but if you're
ever

01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
curious that's the
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
reference and then Revenue
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
administration at line
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
171 uh they sent us mail that they want
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
to keep that this is the system that
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
collects all the taxes one of which we
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
anymore that that's correct it's the uh
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
what they call the rims system or rims
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
so uh couple Capital budgets ago they
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
con proposed to A legislature that their
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
old tax system was Obsolete and out of
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
date and they needed a newer system to
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
um for security purpose one because
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
there was some issues with the sharing
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the federal um IRS information that
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
there were having some challenges with
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
that because of security related to the
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
old system and the um ease of tax pay
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers filing so they wanted to get
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
more e files available many taxpayers
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
prefer to do that than filling out a
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and sending it in um so
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
that Rim system is allowed them to do
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
that the unique thing about the rim
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
system is that I was just mention this
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
it was um bonded with some general funds
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
directly and then um there's a special
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
account that was created
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is from the uptake and the uptake
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
is defined as Revenue that we would not
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
have otherwise
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
collected because of the rim system as a
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
result of the rim system we are now
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
collecting it and and one of the very
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
simple um results was that the notices
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
to taxpayer that you haven't paid your
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
bill that used to not happen before this
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
system now it happens and they get
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
collect Revenue as a result of that
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
there's a it's all in Statute in in
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
terms of how much money can go into that
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
system it's meant to just pay the bond
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
for the the excuse me into that account
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's meant to pay the bond for this
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
system and when that's done all the
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
money would go back to the general
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
fund so but anyways it just it was a a
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
creative way of an agency trying to find
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
a for a fairly expensive system a way to
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
pay for that without taking most of your
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh banial appropriation that you see
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
for the capital budget right that was an
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive project and that was
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
really the only way that we could could
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
squeeze it in is that it's kind of
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes all
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
Ben yeah the next agency I have is
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
safety General so I mentioned earlier
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
that because like for example because
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
of because of the supervision of
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
highways things sometimes we apportion
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
things uh between general fund and
 
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.070 align:start position:0%
things uh between general fund and
Highway

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
Highway
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
are um I have that they wanted to lapse
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
178 and
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
179 that's correct and both of those
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
there's no money associated with those
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
to add to the sheet um both of those
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
were funded with um dedicated funds
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
the fire truck and HVAC was from there's
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
a fire emergency account that um they
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
used to pay for that and then the
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
criminal records has a dedicated fund
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
that was used to pay for that system so
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
any amounts left would just lapse back
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
and not come from those those uh so
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're gonna so we're going to in this
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
agency we're going to delete 178 and
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
179 and then in the highway
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
they have stayed here but they didn't
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
have any appropriation that was active
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
the last thing we did for them was build
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
building so in transportation
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
General we are going to add an extension
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
between well it would fall between 183
 
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.510 align:start position:0%
between well it would fall between 183
and

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
184 uh it's 2023 Roman 15 number three
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
Carol and straford Freight rail
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
improvements uh requested
 
01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.990 align:start position:0%
improvements uh requested
by

01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh the gentleman in the back well I I
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
think that um the department agreed that
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
right to extend that laps extension
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
after discussions with the um the vendor
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
that they were going to work with with
 
01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:44.830 align:start position:0%
that they were going to work with with
that

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
project the project had been
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
um encumbered and and had gone to get a
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
contract it's not due to be completed
 
01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
until December of upcoming December 25
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
um so the thought was just to keep the
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
laps extension in there in case there
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
was any other issues with this um
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
done and
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
then uh in 206 and
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
207 uh when they were here they these
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
are very old there bit there another one
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
of these cases where we might need the
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
money because of a statutory reason
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh but they wanted to repurpose that
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
those those Appropriations are from 2005
 
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.189 align:start position:0%
those those Appropriations are from 2005
and

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
1999 right and I forwarded an email got
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
the language on that to a committee
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
where they uh to the committee where
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
they want to repurpose those two
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
accounts um which is about there's about
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
$825,000 available in the two accounts
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
and repurpose it for Rail and um ties
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
for the state-owned active lines
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
so this is something where that um they
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
have come in and asked for
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations related to that in the
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
past and the department doesn't believe
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to use the funds in the
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
manner that they were originally
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
designated for and they are making this
 
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
designated for and they are making this
um

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
request so this would be an example of
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
um you would zero this out and and do a
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
new appropriation you would repurpose
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
this because it would be for a slightly
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
different purpose overall right and so
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
190 is an example of where we've made an
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation for this in the past may I
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure so for those two items to
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
repurpose they currently have requests
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
in for rails and ties so can we move the
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
money from these two that is left over
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
to help fund the new request of rails
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
and ties is that what so when the
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
committee meets full committee you would
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that option you could decide how
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
you would want to handle that um you
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
could provide the agency with the
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
request that they have here and not
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
provide the other request that was made
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
related to rails and ties for the state
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
owned but you wouldn't let me reframe my
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
question then okay so they want to use
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
this money as a repurpose and then under
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
the new re request it would be added on
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
to this repurpose money so it would be
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
adding the two together no it's going to
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
be two separate Appropriations there's a
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
request for new appropriation that
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
they're asking for the rails and ties
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that they presented to you on uh Tuesday
 
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.590 align:start position:0%
that they presented to you on uh Tuesday
this

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
week a second request is to repurpose
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
this uh these two projects to be used
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
for rails and ties on the state owned
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
lines as
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
well it's not adding the two together
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
they would be separated separate but the
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the for the same types of purposes
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
it maybe um to give them the ability to
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh whereas they identified there's like
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
four miles a track that they really need
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
to fix in the Conway Scenic area I think
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
this would be more of
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
a um yes like a Statewide so as they
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
identify places of their state own track
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
that they really need to fix they can
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
come and do that without asking in two
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
years could we please have some more
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
money to do it but it is up to the
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee as a full to decide how you
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
want to if you want to even do this and
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
how that would relate to the project
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
that they've asked for going forward in
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
the 25 budget that's actually the
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of the subcommittee to to make
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
these decisions and recommendations and
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
get all the wise the wherefores and
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
everything else like you're doing so
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
that when we come
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
Tuesday normally the chair doesn't sit
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
in so you present it to me and say this
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
this is what they want want to do this
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
is we looked into it we did ask the
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
questions this is what we recommend and
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
then I'll put it to our entire committee
 
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
then I'll put it to our entire committee
to

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
say what do we want to do well what what
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
we would normally do is say we located
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
an item that the agency wants to change
 
01:21:12.199 --> 01:21:13.070 align:start position:0%
an item that the agency wants to change
and

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
then I will still make the report even
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
even though you're
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
here it doesn't happen that often that
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
they're repurposing it for the same that
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
they ask for in
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
current all foret right what we're
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
looking at with hp2 is that current
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
requests what this committee is looking
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
at is just mopping up and taking care of
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
all the pass and the money that's
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
already been allocated so it's and and
 
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.110 align:start position:0%
already been allocated so it's and and
the

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
new and the repurpose appropriation
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be 2025 colon some other section
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
number where this is lapsed in the new
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
is is appropriated so you can see an
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
example of that in last year if I might
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
along the same lines as was talking
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
about do you know if the the governor
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
had appropriate had plans for money I
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't recall from the testimony whether
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
she had money in her budget for rails
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
and ties no no they she did not okay so
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
so this would basically offset what
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're looking for since it's already
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
non included in the budget no it will
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
not offset it what if I understood
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
correctly they want to take the money
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the repurpose that's going to be
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
over here that's be I understand and
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
they want to appropriate more money
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's for the for the the same thing
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's going to be a money and
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
then they got B money
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
and yeah I that's what I was trying to
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
get CL that that's the request they have
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
a bucket and a B bucket but it'll be up
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the full committee to decide how they
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
want to handle the two buckets and it
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
could become a single bucket and there
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
could be a SE bucket or no bucket
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
no yes small but again that's not for
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
today's right right so Transportation
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
highway there wasn't any change to what
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
was in there and then um Veterans Home
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
change and that no that
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
so does does everyone think they could
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.310 align:start position:0%
 
year

01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
so so just in recap on your single sheet
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
then after looking at all the projects
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
that the agencies believe that they will
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
be completed by the June 30
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
2025 there is approximately
 
01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.229 align:start position:0%
2025 there is approximately
$649,500

01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
$649,500
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
that could be considered for projects
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
that are being requested by the agencies
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
here and that again would be a
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussion for the full committee after
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
the uh chair Jack presents this
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee's results you
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
know that he would he would present that
 
01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
we went through this that there's a
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
lapse extension requested for the
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
straford Carol line that's not included
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that after reviewing all the laps
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
extensions that aren't needed there's a
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
value that can be um considered by the
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
full committee to for projects that have
 
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.709 align:start position:0%
full committee to for projects that have
been

01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
requested it does not mean you have to
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
use it it just means it's available to
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
consider doing
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
that so so representative Boger with
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
request for the rail from do that has
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
governor and
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
they have the dot has also repurposed
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
$649,000 is money available that should
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
we want to fund their a bucket which is
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
their request we can do that with this
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
money there you go that's just what I
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to as long as we were having a
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
bucks and C buckets and bck buckets
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
there and and we also have the the two
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
line items that we
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
identified that the where the where the
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
agency has withdrawn the request so
 
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.669 align:start position:0%
agency has withdrawn the request so
that's

01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
um I noticed on the bottom of your very
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
very useful
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
page I love it and thank you very much
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
this this has been a tremendous help
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
this one pager uh but there's a three
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
lines at the bottom of it right would
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
you expand upon those three and thank
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
you for bringing I meant to do that
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
earlier oh yeah good idea so when the
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
agencies presented um the laps extension
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
information to you when they presented
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
their Capital budgets these three
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
projects showed up with um potential
 
01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:17.709 align:start position:0%
projects showed up with um potential
money

01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
available these projects were never
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
extended with a lapse extension they
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
were encumbered projects so the money is
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
truly not available for us to repurpose
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
at this time because technically when
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
the project ended anything left should
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
have gone to zero they didn't have this
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
this extension that I could go and go
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
into the law and say oh move this
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
extension and and we'll take the money
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
from it so I just wanted to note that in
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
case somebody remembered when the
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
corrections came in there were these two
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
projects that on their list why didn't I
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
include it in the above number so if I
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
may um where does the little
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
over 20,000 I think it looks like it's a
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
little over 20 grand yeah where does
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
that go just gets taken off the books
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes so if I might go back to something
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
that represent bogert uh kind of alluded
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
to I think so this 649,000 that is
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
coming back through the uh laps
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
issue this money can be used for any
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
line item that has been requested by any
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
Department it's not specific to we took
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
away 335,000 from one Department this is
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
for general fund to help offset the cost
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
in any area that we feel is the most
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we would recommend
 
01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:01.550 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we would recommend
thank

01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
you and for instance because you got a
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I was going to sh I was going to
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
share this with the full committee on
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I've got so much paperwork
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
here I I don't I don't know what I did
 
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.709 align:start position:0%
here I I don't I don't know what I did
with

01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:25.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
but when you looking for Mr sh how many
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
additional requests what what was our
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
additional requests our
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
original Governor's budget was
 
01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.070 align:start position:0%
original Governor's budget was
$143

01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
$143
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
Million our additional requests were
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
$102 million for additional
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
requests so you can tell that that that
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
that if we funded everybody with
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
everything we' we'd
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
Yeah well yeah so so we
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
had yeah this this is the one yeah this
 
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
we had total new requests of $102
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
million above what is already in our
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
$143 million Governor's
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
budget so that's what we're going to be
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:20.910 align:start position:0%
looking at
on

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday out of that 102 million
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
102 m900
 
01:29:32.109 --> 01:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
th000 we've got we' got 600,000 to th
 
01:29:32.119 --> 01:29:37.189 align:start position:0%
th000 we've got we' got 600,000 to th
toward

01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
that and if I may we have a
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
a if it's an appropriate
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
ask uh do we have a goal in mind of uh
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss that on
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday our
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
goal so Mr chairman representative Boger
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
starting to read my mind so you
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier right that this a
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget there's the requested
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
amounts and then there's the treasury
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
secretary's amount that's what we're
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about eventually is
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
you just a question for anybody
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
on this sheet here the additional
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
requests there was something public
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
radio the Press whatever that when the
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
budget was being worked on that the
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
governor had put out I want
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
your needs but not your wants is this
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
needs items or
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
wants would you have an opinion many of
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
those would be what the agencies
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
presented at the governor's Capital but
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
hearings last June yes that didn't get
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
included in this document so they many
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the agencies presented to you in the
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
priority number that they had because
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
some of the things identified in here by
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
the governor weren't at the same
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
priority level as the agency so um I I
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I don't know if it's a need or
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
a want but it was what was presented in
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the agencies feel it was appropriate
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
to bring it back to your attention right
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative Newton this this is your
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
this is your child's Christmas
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
list it's the governor has is is your
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget that you can afford for your
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
child's Christmas list it's fair to say
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
that every
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
time the agencies come in with items or
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
a different priority
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
order uh some of them were funded in the
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget some not but they feel
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's every time this happens they come
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
in with their own list of things they
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
would like to see funded that they feel
 
01:31:54.159 --> 01:31:57.070 align:start position:0%
would like to see funded that they feel
are

01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
I if I go to the uh uh compare
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
report okay um on there it says the
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
total appropriation sections one and two
 
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.430 align:start position:0%
total appropriation sections one and two
is

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.270 align:start position:0%
is
207

01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
207
 
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.510 align:start position:0%
207
million

01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
782 does that 207 million
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
actually I guess the
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
207 is uh a subset of the the 143 to 4
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
million from the highway fund bonds and
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
total other funds and all that is
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
subtracted from it and then what we're
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
looking at at the 143 approximate level
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
is what the governor said should be
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
bonded the the 143 is the general
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
funds and that's what we would bond is
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
the 14 no you'd be bonding the other
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
stuff as well but it's not being paid by
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
the um general fund that portion so the
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
highway fund would pay its portion the
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
other funded agencies would pay its for
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
portion so we would be looking at trying
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
to attempt to bond 207
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
sheet right the thing we so it's 170
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
million I think there's some federal
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
funds included on that one sheet yes
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
bonded okay so we would subtract out the
 
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
toal 170 million yeah the 37 38 million
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
would get subtracted out I'm going to
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
round numbers because we're just talking
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
generally talking so we would subtract
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
out of the 200
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
7 uh the
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
37 and then that's what would be looked
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
at as state bonding even though the
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for the bonds would come
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
from separate
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
locations that's correct and then if we
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
207 and add the
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
New U additional
 
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:24.970 align:start position:0%
requests that would take that up to over
 
01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:26.350 align:start position:0%
requests that would take that up to over
[Music]

01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
300 if you included everything yes but I
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
believe when the treasurer was here she
 
01:34:31.719 --> 01:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
believe when the treasurer was here she
talked

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
talked
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
about the are talking about I'm just
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the ask y the ask is the
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
total ask is
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
over 309 thou 309 million well on the
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
bright side that's less than a billion
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
which was the ask for the governor when
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's capital budget hearing
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
back in June well to be fair we ask the
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
agencies to come in with whatever they
 
01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
might want and then the Press reports
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
they Big Spenders they want a billion
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
dollars but that's what we asked them to
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
do and then prioritize from there as to
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative boger's point the number
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
that we manage to is the general fund
 
01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
bonding Vis what the treasurer
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
recommended and then the highway fund
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
bonding you know and the other fund
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
bonding it's in there and it is bonded
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't manage to that number there
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
is in fact the same 10% cap on the
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund bonding but it usually it
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
works out all right without actually
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
being looked
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
at in in in layman's term with
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
everything you just said in layman's
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
term is we would look at the treasurer's
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
gold of of what number she gave us no
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
matter how the pay for of that is taken
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
care of well because you you would you
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is the other funds and
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
the highway funds going to pay a portion
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
of what we totally Bond yes but we only
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
consider the the treasur is giving you
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
the general fund bonding
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
Target only the general fund Target so
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
then that's why I'm trying to ask these
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions so we can clarifying so you
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
would take the general let's say hyp
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
hypthetically they said 100 uh 120
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
million okay good number then we could
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
say uh on top of that 120 million we're
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to add uh 4.6 million and then uh
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
22 million on top of the 120 million so
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
the general fund is expected to pay $120
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
million Bond and then others would add
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
would let's go back to your buckets
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
let's go back to your buckets you got
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
well that still goes to 143 million yeah
 
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter this this committee is
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
charged with bucket a that's that's the
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
treasur side B Highway funds we have no
 
01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:21.109 align:start position:0%
treasur side B Highway funds we have no
say

01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
on Buck so the rest of the buckets will
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
all add up to your 200 but our purview
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
is bucket a is it going to be 120 or
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
143 represent Bogart it might be helpful
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at the house bill
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
five that your Bond's
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
authorized what page was that or page
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
five it's uh starts on line eight
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
and if you y you drop to line 11
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
exceeding the sum of 170 million and
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
then you go to line 13 the general fund
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
amount is 143 the highway fund amount is
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
4.6 and the other funds is 22
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay so the the bill when the body um
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
adopts it would give the the treasurer
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to bond up to $170
 
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
million and the source of funds for that
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
$70 million would be um found on lines
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
13 and
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
14 that's what I was trying to get to
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad I could help you thank you
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and what the rating agencies look at is
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
debt as a percentage of unrestricted
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
revenue and when they say that they mean
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
general fund bonded debt as a percentage
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
of general fund unrestricted
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue which hypothetically and in fact
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
and which they'd like to have under 10%
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
and in fact they like to have the in
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
fact it's a statutory requirement that
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
the highway fund be under 10% also but
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
that usually just works out so we don't
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
actually manage to that number
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative Jack I
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
would I would recommend that uh we
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
adjourn this meeting and handle any
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
other question commit handle all the No
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
No handle any remaining questions just
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
take them offline to Mr Shay sounds like
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
an EXC mean time there's no reason to
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
keep sounds like an excellent plan we
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:40:22.310 align:start position:0%
