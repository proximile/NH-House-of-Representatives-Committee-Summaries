00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
from the community college system as she
 
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
from the community college system as she
mentioned

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
and also the interim chancellor of the
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
and following don and and susan we will
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
then have
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh catherine provencher i've known
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
catherine for a number of years
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
when she was treasurer of the state here
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that was very important to all of us
 
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.110 align:start position:0%
and that was very important to all of us
and

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
now she is uh interim chance or for the
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
and welcome and joe moran i've had the
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure working with you uh
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
as a a part-time trustee when i took the
 
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.309 align:start position:0%
as a a part-time trustee when i took the
spot

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
spot
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
of uh our speaker and i really enjoyed
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
that opportunity
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
so going into where we are today
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
don could you please start um with a
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
presentation regarding
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you you sent us a a short well we
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually got from
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
from uh uh chancellor uh provencher
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh a sheet identifies some of the
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
issues both sides the coin here in terms
 
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
issues both sides the coin here in terms
of

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh what a merger might mean for for our
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
university system so
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh could you please uh go ahead and and
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
and present thanks
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh appreciate the opportunity to come
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
and talk for a few minutes and
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh i think all of you have a copy of uh
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
what uh kathy sent at least i hope so
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm gonna go through some of the
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
high points
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
just because over the years i've been in
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
four different
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
educational systems and i've gotten to
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
see a lot of different pieces of that
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
also studied some because i often went
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
to other campus systems to look at how
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
they were working and functioning
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
because of some of the jobs i had in
 
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.070 align:start position:0%
because of some of the jobs i had in
academia

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
academia
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
but before that i was in industry for
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
about 14
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
15 years actually a few more than that
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
so got to see a little bit of both sides
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
and how things work together
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the benefits of the states in the
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
system particularly i focused a lot of
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
time on how
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
systems can work on economic development
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
and support of the states in which
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
they're apart
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
in fact starting out in new mexico state
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
really looked at
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
what uh how and what you could do as a
 
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.150 align:start position:0%
what uh how and what you could do as a
university

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
to make a difference in the future of
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
the state and the directions
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
it goes i put together this kind of
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
list of two parts really uh i think
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a there's two sides of
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
the coin here one looking at
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
what the benefits and potential benefits
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
are and the other side is looking
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
at some of the challenges when you do do
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of a consolidation like this
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so each one of these items that i have
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
down here has a story and i don't have
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
tell all the stories that are associated
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
by that but i just want to hit some
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
highlights of it that you can go with us
 
00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.749 align:start position:0%
highlights of it that you can go with us
don

00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
don
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
don can you hear us yes no
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay yep okay can you hear me all right
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's on your i think maybe on
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
your end rick
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't we can hear brooks fine
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
okay can you never tell sometimes with
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'll keep going then and uh you may want
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
to wait a minute
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay comes back there you go are you
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
back rick
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
oops lost you again you're muted direct
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
there you go all right we're good all
 
00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.509 align:start position:0%
there you go all right we're good all
good

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay i'll start with some of the what
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
i've seen over the course of time
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
as the benefits of an integrated system
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
and how it might play a role here
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh one of the things
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
i've liked
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
at in other systems that i've seen is
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
when they have an
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
integrated structure they're better able
 
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.870 align:start position:0%
integrated structure they're better able
to

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
have representation that's coherent
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
and strategic throughout the state each
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the campuses
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
sort of is an outlet for their
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
communities in which they're apart
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and there's also the opportunities of
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
what we used to call in
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
texas mitzi's where campuses get
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
together and provide smaller outlets
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
to regions that normally wouldn't have
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
an educational presence so
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i like about an
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
integrated system is
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
a strategic view and having touch points
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
the state to address the needs of
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
different regions
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
but be able to pull on and draw the
 
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
but be able to pull on and draw the
resources

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
of a whole system so that's one thing
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
i've seen that works pretty well
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
also there's there's an aspect of a
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
unified system
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the governor in the legislature can
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
work with and and i say this from the
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
several the states have been a part of
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
the universities
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
have been a key part in the strategic
 
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.310 align:start position:0%
have been a key part in the strategic
direction

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
and setting the strategic direction for
 
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
and setting the strategic direction for
the

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
state as a whole and sort of a tri-part
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
arrangement where the government
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh the state the legislature the
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
local industries and academia get
 
00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
local industries and academia get
together

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
to map out a strategic plan and strategy
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
to move the state forward and putting
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
together in a single group like that
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
provides a good way
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
for legislatures and governors
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
and and the various entities to interact
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and have a sort of strategic statewide
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
goal and presence uh i think also one
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
thing i found
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
is when there's a unified system you're
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
better able to deal with some of the
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
cross-cutting needs that businesses have
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
often businesses will have to
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
draw on and need resources from not just
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
the local campus but
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
different elements of the system as a
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
whole and it's
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
really helpful when they can work and
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate as a whole
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
in a way that allows the system
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
to put together the capabilities that
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
are needed for a given region for a
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
project or idea that they're working on
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of a unified approach this
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
we looked at this in new mexico
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
because the land-grant institution which
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
i was a part of had outlets all through
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
and so we worked really to how to be
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
able to address the needs of the
 
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.069 align:start position:0%
able to address the needs of the
individuals

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
outlets and be able to take the
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
resources of the system as a whole
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
and apply them to the problems and
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
challenges throughout the state
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
and and i think it it really brings the
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
sort of educational strengths to a
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
region i found this also in texas
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
where texas a m had what was the
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
equivalent of
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
a um what you call usually the ag
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
service station or ag station they had
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
an engineering one
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
and what they did was they had were able
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
to support businesses throughout the
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
state and economic development that went
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
on those regions so
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
having a system kind of unified system
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
like that gives you the ability to do
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
some of these things
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
that are tougher to do as individual
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
elements and
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
pieces i i've also found
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
that it strengthens the academic
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
pathways that students
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
have from an associate level all the way
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
through to phd
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
students find at different times in
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
their lives they need different bits of
 
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
their lives they need different bits of
education

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
and having a way where that's a
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
coordinated approach where they can take
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
classes in one place and build on those
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
educational elements stackable so to
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
speak throughout a whole range from
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
to a bs to an ms to a phd if needed
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
or even even in elements less than that
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
enables them to sort of tailor their
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
education throughout their lifetime
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
to their needs as they grow as an
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
individual and with their business
 
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.829 align:start position:0%
individual and with their business
opportunities

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
have i think it also provides greater
 
00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:48.150 align:start position:0%
have i think it also provides greater
affordability

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
and i think the rate way it does that is
 
00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:51.430 align:start position:0%
and i think the rate way it does that is
it

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
provides a pathway for students through
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
two-year institutions to four-year
 
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
two-year institutions to four-year
institutions

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and what where they can afford to
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
live locally get an education that's
 
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
live locally get an education that's
more

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
economically balanced for the first
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years but also be
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
able to because of the system sort of
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
approach be able to take courses in
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that lead them to get a bs or an ms or
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
phd degree
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think is critical also
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
is there's better branding
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities when you have a unified
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
system we're in competition
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
for with all the uh states around us uh
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the costs are less a lot of
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
our students leave to get education
 
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.110 align:start position:0%
our students leave to get education
elsewhere

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of our graduates leave to uh get
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
jobs elsewhere
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things about
 
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things about
enabling

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
a system as a whole to have a brand it
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
allows you to compete more effectively
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
to keep your students that are in the
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
state in the state
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
because you can actually tie together
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
the elements of it and actually project
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
to their population
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
what the capabilities are and the
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities within your own
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
own sort of system if we're disjointed
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes hard to be able to do
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
that in a unified way
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that we
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
could really use in new hampshire is
 
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
could really use in new hampshire is
this

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
kind of informed perspective on what the
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
system as a whole is
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
to allow us to compete with effectively
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
with out-of-state
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh systems i always think that
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
what i've seen is if you do it right and
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you make the combined system
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh what it can be there's there's really
 
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.590 align:start position:0%
uh what it can be there's there's really
the

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
ability to eliminate the competitiveness
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
within a system
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
and actually use it to specialize the
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
tasks and the skills that are needed in
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
various areas throughout the state
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
so it allows you to complement those
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
skills rather than competing with them
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i've found that oftentimes if it's
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
not when you don't have an organized
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
system like that
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's their tendency is to sort of create
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
redundancies throughout the system
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
whether it be in back office operations
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
or in the actual operations that
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh the educational offerings that are
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
that are had
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
we're working on some of that now at a
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
system level and i think
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
what's happened in this last year really
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
makes this view
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
much more possible is because many of
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
our classrooms now
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
are put together so that we have video
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
links so that we can
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
do remote education very easily
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
so places that are more remote that
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
may have been not
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
not very strong in in the amount of
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
education they could get
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
now with this combined sort of system
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
view with the automation that's occurred
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
allows you to target and put at each
 
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
allows you to target and put at each
location

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
i think uh capabilities that would be
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
needed by the students in those areas
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
um let me see some of the other things i
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up
 
00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up
uh

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah there's another some aspects that i
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
kind of like and i've watched at other
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
places i've been
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
um and that is and particularly i found
 
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:17.180 align:start position:0%
this in
 
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.309 align:start position:0%
this in
[Music]

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
in texas when i was at the university of
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
houston system
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
is the ability of the flagship to
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
concentrate more on graduate and phd
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
programs but also on business innovation
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
and r
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
d and then working with the other
 
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
d and then working with the other
campuses

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
around the state that ability to sort of
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
mix that
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
capability to provide the sort of
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
business support that's needed at all
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
different levels
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
and also provide the student capability
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
to address the
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
business needs that are in various
 
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
business needs that are in various
locations

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
i think there's the ability to better
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
track student progress in leveraging
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
some of support
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
now before ross left we were working
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
together on
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
developing a common pathway approach in
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
both the community colleges
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the university system and i think
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
the potential that
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
to assure students when they come in
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
that they've got a seamless pathway
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
from beginning wherever they are to
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
completing their degree
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
in any of the locations around the state
 
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
in any of the locations around the state
really

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of benefits i think there
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
are benefits to the community
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
colleges in this way but also in the
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
four-year institutions because
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of a relationship that
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
in which the value of both community
 
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.310 align:start position:0%
in which the value of both community
college

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh activities and the the
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes less applied uh work that's
 
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
sometimes less applied uh work that's
done

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
at universities can see that everybody
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
every group can see the advantages of
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
both approaches and it brings
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
reality to both sides of the issue it
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
provides pathways for students to grow
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
and learn but it also
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
provides and pulls i think the
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
the campuses that are for your
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
institutions more into the world of
 
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.909 align:start position:0%
institutions more into the world of
saying

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
here are the needs of the state and the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
region how do we
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
dress and marry those two together
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
because i think there's a sort of a
 
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
because i think there's a sort of a
communication

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
link that comes through both the
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
community colleges and the
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
research and development activities that
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
really and
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
something i've worked on for years and
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
trying to build as the
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
research vice president at universities
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
this sort of pathway from
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
this innovation and idea concept
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
all the way to implementation and that's
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
why we built the clusters that
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
at plymouth state was to really build in
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
this concept that there's
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
real need for the educational elements
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
that have to do with innovation and
 
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.830 align:start position:0%
that have to do with innovation and
research

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
but there also needs to be the
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
application of those skill sets so
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think uh those bringing those pieces
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
together is really
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
helpful i know the missions are slightly
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
different but i also think there's a lot
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
of benefit that both
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
community colleges and universities get
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
from the integration with each other
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
on those aspects i also think if it's if
 
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.710 align:start position:0%
on those aspects i also think if it's if
it's

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
done well and right
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it leads to partnerships and innovations
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
in regions across the state because it's
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
just that awareness
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
and involvement throughout the state and
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
so there's that exchange going on
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
constantly between different locations
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
many of you know that the north country
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
from our perspective has has some real
 
00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
from our perspective has has some real
challenges

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh ahead and i think the ability to
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we've been working with white
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
mountain the ability i think to really
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
address the problems and needs of a
 
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
address the problems and needs of a
region

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
as well as the educational needs i think
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
offers a lot to as we go forward in the
 
00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
offers a lot to as we go forward in the
future

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
and and the opportunity increase for
 
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.990 align:start position:0%
and and the opportunity increase for
partnerships

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
partnerships
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
and uh co-location of activities
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and i think on the larger scale
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
i have really enjoyed and liked in
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
previous states that i've been a part of
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
the interaction between the university
 
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
the interaction between the university
systems

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the state on their strategic goals
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
of what they're trying to accomplish and
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think working together as a team like
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
that and developing the partnerships are
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
stronger when you've got
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
a unified way to look at it i think on
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the other side of it
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of issues about
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i just was reading something about
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the various past trustees
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
wrote and and they're all right i mean
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
there are challenges with this
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
i think it would require the legislature
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
probably more engaged with the actual
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
activities that are going on
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the university system as a whole but
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
i look at that as a positive from a
 
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.350 align:start position:0%
i look at that as a positive from a
partnership

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
side so i think if we don't do it right
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
and i've seen it not done right
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
i've seen community colleges be
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
relegated to some
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
part that doesn't really get the
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
attention it's needed
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
i've also seen another approach like at
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
penn state
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
where essentially penn state was a
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
mixture of
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
research institution with a huge
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
research budget and with many graduate
 
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
research budget and with many graduate
programs

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
mixed with campuses all throughout the
 
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.909 align:start position:0%
mixed with campuses all throughout the
state

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
that originally started as one year and
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
two-year campuses
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
and many of them went on to become
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
four-year institutions but the strength
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
of having the backbone
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the main campus
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
with the campuses that around the state
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
i was particularly at penn state barron
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
allowed us to do development and
 
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.990 align:start position:0%
allowed us to do development and
opportunities

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
that we would have never had otherwise
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
we have developed the whole engineering
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
program it became very popular
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
we took a research park we had 120 acres
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
we worked with the maine university
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
system to set that up we acquired the
 
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
system to set that up we acquired the
property

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh we started working with companies
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh by time i had left uh it was a
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
financially beneficial to the university
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
but the research park was completely
 
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.230 align:start position:0%
but the research park was completely
full

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
of companies that were working in there
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
developing new ideas for the region
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
so i think the the models where i've
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
seen it work
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
they take a lot of the the
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
items that you could not afford to do
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
individually at the campuses
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
and combining them with the strengths of
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
having a strong
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
sort of central uh capability
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
at the at flagship at the flagship
 
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
at the at flagship at the flagship
university

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
makes it so that we in essence had a lot
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
of strength and we could have
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
gone as as penn state barron we grew to
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
the point where we could have been a
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
stand-alone campus and not been a part
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll admit there's the downside of
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can feel like you don't have as much
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
of a say
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
in what you're doing but on the other
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
side of it is when you have something
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
you want to do
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
you've got the background and support of
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
the entire system
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
in what you're trying to do and so i i
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
was able to build a building towards the
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
end there
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was unique through a lot of
 
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.430 align:start position:0%
that was unique through a lot of
industry

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
corp universities at least our size
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
i was able to build a building that had
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
offices and suites for businesses
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time it had classrooms right
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
beside them
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
for education and so it sort of bridged
 
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
for education and so it sort of bridged
that

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
world between the research park we had
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
built with the
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
community needs and the educational
 
00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
community needs and the educational
needs

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the specific research needs and
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
companies from all over the world
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
came and joined that so i i i think
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
um there are downsides to it if we're
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
not careful
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think we need to always watch
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
that each mission is being addressed and
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's kind of stated in the
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the end there i think it's easy
 
00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.549 align:start position:0%
in the end there i think it's easy
sometimes

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
to uh and it's even easy to do that
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
within the system as it exists today
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's easy to sort of put too much
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the flagship and not enough
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
on the individual campuses but i think
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
the partnership with the legislature can
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
be really positive
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
i mean you're not really giving away
 
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
i mean you're not really giving away
everything

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
you've got control over everything in a
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
way by
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the way you fund things and i think
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
there are options within that of how you
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
do that to make sure that
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
the resources are getting where you need
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
them to be and
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing strategically what is most
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
useful for the
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
university as a whole there can be it
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
can become a bureaucracy
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
penn state became that uh and they had
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
to reevaluate about
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
say three or four years ago they went
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
through and relooked at everything they
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to streamline their
 
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.549 align:start position:0%
to be able to streamline their
operations

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
i but i think when you look at it i'll
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
two systems that are comparable in uh
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
in pennsylvania one's the pasi system
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
which essentially is a state system a
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't realize penn state's
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
actually the largest private university
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
and what the pasi system did was
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
had independent branches throughout the
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
state that were linked together
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
with with
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
this central system head
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
and they functioned pretty much
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
autonomously over that time
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
penn state with their one university
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
concept which was a united system that
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
had two-year one-year and four-year
 
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
had two-year one-year and four-year
institutions

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
all throughout the state linked together
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
as one system
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and if you look at it now you've got
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
penn state
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
some very successful campuses across the
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
the state helping in so many different
 
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.029 align:start position:0%
the state helping in so many different
areas

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
the development of pennsylvania largely
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
supported now
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
by the legislature because they see
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
the value of the components that are in
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
those various parts of the state
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
but you've got the passage system
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
which was state funded and supported
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it's now looking at how it's going
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
to consolidate
 
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:41.650 align:start position:0%
the individual groups of campuses
 
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
the individual groups of campuses
[Music]

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
for their future survival and
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
if i i think sometimes if they had
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
addressed the issue earlier of how they
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
work together as a system
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the whole they would have been a
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
competitor to penn state rather than a
 
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
competitor to penn state rather than a
tremendous

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
laggard within the state now where
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're discussing what they can
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
actually offer anymore so i i think
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's just sort of this looking ahead
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.230 align:start position:0%
there's just sort of this looking ahead
certainly

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
higher ed is in a crisis phase right now
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
but it's been it's been those that have
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
looked ahead to what the future
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
brings before it happens uh
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
like the passage system waited too long
 
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.630 align:start position:0%
like the passage system waited too long
and

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
suffered in in that realm
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
whereas penn state which actually has a
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
two-year community college is a part of
 
00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:40.549 align:start position:0%
two-year community college is a part of
it

00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's working very well uh
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
unified and built a backbone and back
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
office systems
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
that supported each of the campuses well
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
and allowed the systems
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the campuses to really be strong
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
partners with their community
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
in a way that they could draw on
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
resources and capabilities throughout
 
00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:04.149 align:start position:0%
resources and capabilities throughout
the

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
penn state system so um
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think i said enough but i just wanted
 
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.630 align:start position:0%
i think i said enough but i just wanted
to

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
hit some highlights as i said there's
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's stories to go with each of the
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
points that i brought down
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh i personally am not either pro or
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
against consolidation but i thought
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
when i i always like to see the benefits
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
of both sides of the coin
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
and personally in the situation we are
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
in now
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
i see that there are some real benefits
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
as we go forward in doing the
 
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
as we go forward in doing the
consolidation

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
consolidation
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh dr burks uh i
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
have some questions but i'm gonna hold
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
my questions back and i'll probably
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
call you up on on the phone and ask you
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the commonwealth
 
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.830 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the commonwealth
system

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
and penn state being within that system
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
which involves temple university and
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and pitt and and and lincoln uh
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
but within the penn state i'm really
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing how they resolve
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
credit transfers uh that traditionally
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
in our system have been approved by the
 
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
in our system have been approved by the
program

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
or the department and how you were able
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
to arrive
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
at a a course 101
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
in in uh at your
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
your penn state major campus there and
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
then where you were
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
out in erie the same credit course
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
it met the same standards etc and was
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
accepted from one
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the 20 odd penn state uh locations so
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to you about that a
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
little later uh i'll open this up to a
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
few other questions that may come and
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
then we're going to move right into
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes represent ellison uh
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you don for for the presentation i
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
just ha
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
i have one which has been on the
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
forefront of my mind since we started
 
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
forefront of my mind since we started
this

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you have a sense of what the time
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
frame is to try to put
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
the systems together given the
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
complicated issues that we're all
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question i will tell
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
you this there's two ways to do this
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
and i've seen this in the pennsylvania
 
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.070 align:start position:0%
and i've seen this in the pennsylvania
system

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
which i think representative ladd
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
pretty well one
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the pennsylvania apache system studied
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
it for years
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
and was unable to really to come to
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
any agreement before it was too late and
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
so they found themselves in kind of a
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
bad situation i think you do it in
 
00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
bad situation i think you do it in
phases

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
phases
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
and steps i think the the step of
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
making a board that's really working on
 
00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:48.470 align:start position:0%
making a board that's really working on
and

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
if there's one thing i would do maybe
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
in doing this i think the time frame of
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
putting together a board
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
makes sense as soon as possible in fact
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
i think there should be a group of
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
individuals from both of the campuses
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
working together to sort of
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
map this out and map how this works um
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think i would if you didn't call it a
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
board you'd definitely put a
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
group of people together that were
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
interested and knowledgeable about
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
education and could be a part of it so i
 
00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
education and could be a part of it so i
think

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
i think the track you're on makes sense
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think you're
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think you're moving ahead of the
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
that it takes to really study this and
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
do it right
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
but i think you're launching it and i
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
think launching it is very important
 
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.310 align:start position:0%
think launching it is very important
because

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
the passy system played with it for too
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
long and therefore lost the aspect of
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
being able to do it
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think just a quick answer to rick
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
ladd's question
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
because i think it's a really good one
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
and it's one i'm working on with the
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
university of maine now is
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
how you do accreditation across the
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
whole system
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
and that is the beauty of the penn state
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
system is
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
you enter any campus and it's just like
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're in
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
any campus in other words everything
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
translates right on through
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
the graduation rate of students that and
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
many students
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
would start at an individual campus and
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
plan on going to the main campus
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
and would end up staying at the
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
individual campus because they really
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
got grounded and got the education they
 
00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:22.389 align:start position:0%
got grounded and got the education they
want

00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
wanted but any student who wanted the
 
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.070 align:start position:0%
wanted but any student who wanted the
transfer

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
was was automatically admitted to the
 
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
was was automatically admitted to the
other

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the penn state main campus so just
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
you got into one you got into another
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
now you may not be able to succeed but
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
87 of those that
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
did that graduated uh that came from the
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
individual campuses so
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
it had a graduation rate that wasn't a
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
whole lot different than it was for the
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
those that had gone up through the main
 
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.310 align:start position:0%
those that had gone up through the main
campus

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
campus
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're muted you're muted rick
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll go with representative moffat
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
with a question but i'd like to also
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know hold back for some of our
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
questions to the latter part so that we
 
00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:06.870 align:start position:0%
questions to the latter part so that we
could

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh get susan hewitt in and i'd like to
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
hear from catherine
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
fincher and joe moran as well here so uh
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative moffatt sure
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
and uh welcome dr burks uh real quick i
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
spent many years in the university
 
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
spent many years in the university
system

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
mostly at plymouth and i also spent uh
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
over 20 years in the cc
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
snh system so i spent a lot of time in
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
both systems
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
a difference currently between the
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
systems but you mentioned
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
funding ccsnh has been
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
essentially a state agency where the
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislature could
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
could see the line items usna it's a
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
little bit different
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
more autonomy there there's so many
 
00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
more autonomy there there's so many
pieces

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
to this but let me just ask you uh one
 
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
to this but let me just ask you uh one
question

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh as you see this moving forward in
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
some fashion
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
again the ccs and h folks of which i was
 
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.069 align:start position:0%
again the ccs and h folks of which i was
one

00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
were in our essentially state employees
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
the usnh folks as i mentioned have a
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
little more autonomy so
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
if or however this merger comes about if
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
or when
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you see everyone in this merged
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
situation as being a a state employee
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
on the ccs nh model or having more
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
autonomy and separation as per the us
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
nh model i think that's determinate
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
determination that the legislature can
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
make i
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
i found interestingly when i was at penn
 
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
i found interestingly when i was at penn
state

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
that there were individuals in different
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.589 align:start position:0%
that there were individuals in different
plans

00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
plans
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh so although there was
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
one system it had a variety of
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
approaches that it used for
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
how it did things so i think
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's something to be discussed
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
and worked on
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
as things move forward i think there
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
are benefits to making the system as
 
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
are benefits to making the system as
coherently

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
coherently
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
united as possible but i think there
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
is room for flexibility as i've seen in
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
other systems
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i mean when i was at new mexico state
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was essentially
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
different a different system uh the
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
community colleges were
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
but they were still a part of the system
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole and still part strategically
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
of what we were trying to do
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i think you've got some flexibility
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
in that line that that's a good question
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps when we get to some of the
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
other speakers they can also
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
address it represent my our last one and
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go to
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
doctor hewitt just briefly uh uh doctor
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
the question i have is a management
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
question currently
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
we have uh in our system as i understand
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
we have uh in our system as i understand
it

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
each president of the college reports
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
directly to the board of trustees of the
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
with a fairly weak chancellor system
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
in your experience what has been the
 
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.349 align:start position:0%
in your experience what has been the
management

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
structure in some of the successful
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
systems that you've been in
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
as it relates to presence of colleges
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
versus a stronger ceo
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh in a as a from a chancellor
 
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh in a as a from a chancellor
perspective

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i've seen every mixture of that
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to know uh i personally like
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
the one where
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
the presidents report directly to the
 
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
the presidents report directly to the
board

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
but i know there's a lot that think that
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
should be report directly to a
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
ceo so i have seen it work
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
where when i was at university of
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
houston the presidents did support
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
did report to the ceo but each of the
 
00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
did report to the ceo but each of the
campuses

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
had was given a lot of autonomy by the
 
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.790 align:start position:0%
had was given a lot of autonomy by the
legislature

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
so they got separate line item funding
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
and everything like that
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
so it was kind of a mixed mode i i was
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
sold at penn state where
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
the campuses were really aggregated
 
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
the campuses were really aggregated
under

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
a certain campus office but which you
 
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.069 align:start position:0%
a certain campus office but which you
had

00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
direct access to the to the
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh board and also to
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
the uh president so um
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's so many different ways to make
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
it work uh
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
i know joe's got a particular feeling
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
about what it should be
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of at look at it a little
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
bit differently that way but
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
it works both ways it just has to be
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
done in a way that
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
really allows you to share this at the
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
strategy as a whole across the system
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to allocate the resources
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the particularly back office
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation operations that you need
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much i think
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
this is a real important issue and i
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh it's some some of us
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm a person that believes a
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
little bit different that
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh differently that you need a strong
 
00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.190 align:start position:0%
uh differently that you need a strong
ceo

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
ceo
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
managing um where are you going
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i i think that buck has to stop
 
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.829 align:start position:0%
and i i think that buck has to stop
somewhere

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh so but i'd like now if we can rick
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
dave you know just a really quick
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
specific question
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
make it click dave no we'll do we'll do
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
rick thanks
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
don thanks very much for um for your
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
time this morning
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that um that
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
plymouth state
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
um is um you know is doing some
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
partnerships with or work working
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
together with
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
white mountain community college and i
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
was just wondering what sort of
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
challenges or difficulties
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
you you've run into with that that
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
um you know couldn't be resolved by
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know working things out with chuck
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
but uh but might be able to be remedied
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
through a merger
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll tell you first of all chuck's
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
been great to work with
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
and uh we both want the same thing
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think where we get into an issue is
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no framework
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
really to do the type of integration
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to do we're certainly
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
sharing back and forth on things but
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
chuck and i have talked about how much
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
further we could go
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
in this if we had a closer association
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh particularly one of the things that
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
you need to resolve are the different
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
faculties in the group and the different
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
ways that those faculties interact with
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
each other having a unified approach
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
allows you to think as a whole
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i think you run into even things you
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't even realize you run into
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
inhibit the movement of things you
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
really want to do so even though you
 
00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
really want to do so even though you
have

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
a president the two presidents that
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
really want
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
to actually work extremely tightly
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
to actually work extremely tightly
together

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh it seems like the issues are just
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
hard when you're not one coherent system
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it works thank you
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
dr burks uh uh i think we're gonna
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
transition now
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
into the community college system with
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh dr heward
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
welcome and um go for it
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative ladd
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit about my background
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
i've taught from grade six through uh
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
graduate school
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
i've been part of the suny system the
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
connecticut community college system
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
and for 11 years now here in new
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire first as president
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
and then i thought i retired and i'm
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
learning the new hampshire way is that
 
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.030 align:start position:0%
learning the new hampshire way is that
one

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really retire so when dr gatel
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
went off to
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh bryant university i've stepped in
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
until the end of june
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
so a number of comments for you i really
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate dr burks's
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
remarks and agree with quite a bit of of
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
what he had to say and i
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated his underscoring the need to
 
00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
appreciated his underscoring the need to
value

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
the voice of the community colleges and
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
i know that our system has shed
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
information about mergers with you and
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's the first place
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
where community colleges experience a
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.829 align:start position:0%
where community colleges experience a
problem

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that in short order our voice is
 
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
is that in short order our voice is
diminished

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
diminished
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
so when you ask the question of what are
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the policy issues here
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
for me that's the initial challenge for
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature and frankly for the new
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
board that will be created
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to say we're going to
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
take five members from the community
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
college board five members from the
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
university board
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
five independents and eight ex officios
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
already from that
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
arrangement some of you have community
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
college experience
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
and you realize what happens on our
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
campuses is different
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
and again dr burke acknowledged that
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
there is a difference in the missions
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
and how we fulfill those missions is
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
slightly different too
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh the whole notion of how are we going
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
to prepare for this
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
i don't object at all to the notion of
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
one board
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
and unifying the systems but there are
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
different ways of
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
of unifying the systems we can look at
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
what just happened in vermont
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
where the you know the community college
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
of vermont
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
is sitting along with the four-year
 
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
is sitting along with the four-year
colleges

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
but it still remains its own entity
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
in part because it's organized
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
differently than
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
the university system and i would make
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
that comment
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
about the organization that we have in
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the seven community colleges do each
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
have a president
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
but they report up to a chancellor uh to
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
a ceo
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
if you will and much of what happens in
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
has been organized in such a way to uh
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
to be efficient so there's one instance
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the student management
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
system uh we use banner currently
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
um eight years ago there were seven
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
instances and so even having students
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
move within our own system was difficult
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
well we have you know fixed that
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
um and i i raised that system as an
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
example of pieces that will have to be
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with and i really encourage
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
um some thoughtful planning i again
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
agree with dr burke's i have looked at
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
what happens in systems where actions
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
are taken and insufficient planning is
 
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
are taken and insufficient planning is
underway

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
underway
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think you can do both simultaneously
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
i describe myself as a refugee from
 
00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
i describe myself as a refugee from
connecticut

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh because when i came in in 2010
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
the the whole merger idea was beginning
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
and here we are 11 years later
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
and it it still is not any place near
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
being complete one of my side jobs is
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a commissioner for
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh neche i know you're going to hear
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
from barbara brittingham the recently
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
retired president of our regional
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
accrediting organization
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
but i will say that what has happened in
 
00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:06.950 align:start position:0%
but i will say that what has happened in
connecticut

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
is a great display of a lack of planning
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's some wonderful ideas and there's
 
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
there's some wonderful ideas and there's
been

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
very little activity that involves all
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the parties that need to be involved
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
when we talk about becoming one system
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
if what we're ultimately going to do is
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
go for one accreditation
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are lots of pieces to that
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
beginning with mission so as you think
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
about this as legislators please think
 
00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:36.470 align:start position:0%
about this as legislators please think
about

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
who's on that board how that board
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
operates and how it is
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the missions of both entities are
 
00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
that the missions of both entities are
sustained

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to get into some gory
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
details on
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
on academics so i'm i'm going to think
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
about you
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
you put the two entities the university
 
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:56.790 align:start position:0%
you put the two entities the university
system

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the community college system
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
together okay
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
so by accreditation it's the faculty
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
that has responsibility for the
 
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
that has responsibility for the
curriculum

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
who's going to make different decisions
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an example that still
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
stays with me probably five years after
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
there was a young man who graduated from
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
manchester community college he
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
graduated when he was
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
40. and he had a real interest in going
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
into research and i've no doubt at some
 
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
into research and i've no doubt at some
point

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
he will earn a phd because he's he's
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
gifted and a really talented student
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
he wanted to go back to the university
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm not picking on the university um
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we were all surprised to learn that
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
because he had a less than stellar
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
experience when he academic experience
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'll say when he was at unh when he was
 
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
i'll say when he was at unh when he was
18

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
and by his own definition of stupid and
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
majoring in alcohol
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
he ended up on academic probation
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
so now here he is at 40. he's a dad he
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
has two kids
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
he knows what he wants and he wants to
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
go back to the university
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's no academic amnesty program so
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
had that man gone back to the university
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
he would have gone from having the 4.0
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
he had in the community college system
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
to the 0.6 academic gpa he had
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years earlier and i only
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
point that out
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a difference in the
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
mission of our two systems
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
we are you know the college is a second
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
third and fourth
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
chances and we have what are called
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
academic amnesty
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
programs so frankly if you screw up but
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
then you
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
decide you want to come back and you
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
have a a direction and so on there's an
 
00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:54.630 align:start position:0%
have a a direction and so on there's an
opportunity

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
for you well as our
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
unified system moves on i want those
 
00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
unified system moves on i want those
opportunities

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
to exist if we look at what happened
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
in in at the university of alaska
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
system as time went on there were fewer
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
community college students
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and why was that well first because the
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
tuition became less
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
affordable but secondly because of how
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
as you try to unify systems and policies
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
those of us who deal with i'll call them
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'll use the statistical term
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
outliers our situations
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
are not the majority situations and
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
therefore they're not necessarily
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
thought about um i think everybody's
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
entering into this
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh with good faith and good intentions
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
but how this will play out
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
will be a matter of the kinds of
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
planning and the people who are involved
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the planning um let's talk about
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
admissions for a minute because as the
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
the governor talks about it you know he
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
wants to see people
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
admitted and then able to move in the
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
system the community colleges are open
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
admission so sometimes people coming in
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
the door to the community college
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a high school diploma but it
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
excellent academic preparation we are
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
to help people succeed in those
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
situations and we've done
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work i know uh other
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
sessions the education committee has
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
the move from remedial work to
 
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.710 align:start position:0%
the move from remedial work to
co-requisite

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
co-requisite
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh work so that we're not losing people
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not proud to tell you that
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
if we go back you know six years and we
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
students in remedial courses that the
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
pass rate out of remedial math and
 
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.150 align:start position:0%
pass rate out of remedial math and
english

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
english
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
into college level courses was about
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
seven or eight percent
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh that actually was about the national
 
00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh that actually was about the national
average

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
and having switched to a co-requisite
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
model we're seeing a much much higher
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
level of success of people who come in
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen situations where someone has
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
come in the door and wants to be a nurse
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
and starts off in remedial courses
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and has to move all the way through
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
well what's going to happen if this
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
person has applied for admissions
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
in nursing how are you going to make the
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
decision about whether this individual
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
who clearly
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
is not prepared at this moment has that
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity nursing
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
and healthcare are one of the few places
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
where the community college actually has
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
selective admissions but i worry about
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
a student applies to be in a nursing
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
program who's going to make the decision
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
as to whether they
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
go into a community college-based
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
asn program or they go into a four-year
 
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.430 align:start position:0%
asn program or they go into a four-year
program

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know how is it that you're going to
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
preserve the options for students so
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
that they can in fact
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh move through another example
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
we have a co-location situation
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
between keene state college and
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
we have had situations come up because
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
for example the the college made the
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
decision that they're going to do their
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
covet testing on friday afternoons
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly reasonable for them
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's not reasonable for the community
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
college nursing students
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
because they work and so their ability
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
to attend classes was affected
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
because if you have to be at work friday
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
at noon time and you can't have the test
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
that needs
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
to allow you to be on campus how do you
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
now the situation's been worked out and
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
again i
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
raise it not criticizing but pointing
 
00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
raise it not criticizing but pointing
out

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
that there are distinct needs between
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
what community college students are
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
people who elect
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
to begin at a community college versus a
 
00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.829 align:start position:0%
to begin at a community college versus a
four-year

00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
i would also go on to talk a little bit
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
more about
 
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
more about
transfer

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
so many of the stories that you hear
 
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
so many of the stories that you hear
about

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'll call them transfer disasters
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
are in fact not transfer disasters so
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
we often hear the story of now as the
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
student took a math class
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it was adequate for the associate
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
degree and then when that individual
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
transferred to a four-year program that
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
math course wasn't counted or if it was
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
counted it was
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of meaningless elective credit
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
meaning that this individual
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
when he or she completed their
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree was going to graduate
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
with 140
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's it was entirely appropriate in my
 
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.829 align:start position:0%
it's it was entirely appropriate in my
example

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
for the four-year college to say that's
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
not the right math course
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody starts off in liberal arts
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
and decides that they want to
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
go into engineering that math class
 
00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:15.030 align:start position:0%
go into engineering that math class
which

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
may be affectionately described as math
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
for poets
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
is not the right math course and so for
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
to not accept it in that way is
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it's a complicated explanation
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
now there's been work done and i will
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
specifically cite
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
the work that was done between the
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire and the
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the mellon foundation which
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
has resulted in 22
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
strong articulation agreements and the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
way that
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
those articulations came about
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
was the work of a particular professor
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
from the community college system with
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
the university
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
leslie barber leslie then once she
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
understood what the particular course
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
or degree was at the university system
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
organized the community college system
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
and now no matter which of the community
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh no matter which community college
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
you're at if you follow the prescribed
 
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
you're at if you follow the prescribed
pathway

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
your entry to the university system is
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.470 align:start position:0%
your entry to the university system is
assured

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
assured
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's one way we can do business there
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
are other ways that we can do
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
business with all of our four-year
 
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.230 align:start position:0%
business with all of our four-year
partners

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk also about i.t systems
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
we um i mentioned uh that we are using
 
00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:43.990 align:start position:0%
we um i mentioned uh that we are using
banner

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
banner
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
the community pardon me the university
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
system is using several different
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh programs
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be a lot of
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
work over time putting all of those
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
together so again what is the plan
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
how do we go forward uh representative
 
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
how do we go forward uh representative
moffat

00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
moffat
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
brought up that the community college
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff are members of the new
 
00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:10.789 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff are members of the new
hampshire

00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system we wouldn't describe
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
ourselves now representative moffat as
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly tied to some of the
 
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.069 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly tied to some of the
state

00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
systems those will have to be worked out
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
we have at least 11 unions
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
among the group of us what's going to
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
happen there
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i will say that this is a great
 
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
and i will say that this is a great
concern

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
on the part of our uh faculty and staff
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
at this moment uh risk management
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh we have so many areas an intellectual
 
00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh we have so many areas an intellectual
property

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
what what we do in that area what the
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
does very different because how our
 
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.470 align:start position:0%
does very different because how our
faculty

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
are identified and treated is is very
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
different in the systems
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know debt and reserves
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
and marketing and fundraising
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
all of these things will have to be
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
figured out
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
um and i do hope that as our legislature
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
looking at what happens to benefit our
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
residents that you will think in terms
 
00:56:21.359 --> 00:56:21.829 align:start position:0%
residents that you will think in terms
of

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
what you can do to preserve the missions
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
of the two entities
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
i appreciated what dr burke said about
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
the regional needs
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is the key here because
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
the one thing i've learned living in new
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that our regions are quite
 
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that our regions are quite
distinctive

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
distinctive
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
and right now the community colleges are
 
00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:45.510 align:start position:0%
and right now the community colleges are
present

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
but what can you do to preserve the
 
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.109 align:start position:0%
but what can you do to preserve the
regional

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
needs so that we are addressing the
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh needs of not only business but also
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
of our residents
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
so i will stop there and um and
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
let you uh go forward with questions
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to point out to you several
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the areas
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
that i wanted uh you to take into
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
consideration as you look at
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to bring the
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
systems together
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
i think bringing the systems together
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
but how it is you do that and and what
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
it is you think about
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
is very important to thank you thank you
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh dr heward are there questions for the
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative thanks thanks very
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
much uh
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair um excuse me and thanks
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
thanks uh susan for uh joining us um
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in in in
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
in my experience in in private industry
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time i've spent a lot of
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
time writing business plans
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
and um and i was wondering if if you're
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
aware of any examples
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
of um of cis you know system
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um you know in in considering systems
 
00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:10.630 align:start position:0%
um you know in in considering systems
merging

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
merging
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
if um if if states have taken it upon
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh to to essentially start with a
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
business plan
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
type of type of approach on that and um
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
and are there any examples where after
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the business plan was developed and it
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
may have taken
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh quite a while to develop such plans
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
that after the plan was was written it
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
was sort of determined that um that
 
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
was sort of determined that um that
maybe

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
it um you know it doesn't move forward
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that happening i think
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
that many states
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the in the situation
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
that we're in as we look at declining
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
high school enrollments and what the
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
potential impact could be
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say is the the
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
plans that have led to effective
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
reorganizations have primarily been
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
between smaller entities and and and
 
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
between smaller entities and and and
i'll

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh talk about the university of maine
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the work that they're doing
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
they've been moving towards uh
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
unifying into one uh accreditation if
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of years but they've done
 
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.549 align:start position:0%
for a number of years but they've done
it

00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know one uh
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
college site like machias to a
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
another uh one of their locations
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
um so to me the the best examples are
 
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:35.910 align:start position:0%
um so to me the the best examples are
places

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
where we've had entities unite
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
um one college to one college or several
 
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
um one college to one college or several
colleges

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
together rather than uh starting
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh to put the systems together like i
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
wisconsin uh which brought a number of
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
its systems together and is now in the
 
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.549 align:start position:0%
its systems together and is now in the
process

00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
of trying to figure out how to um sort
 
01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.309 align:start position:0%
of trying to figure out how to um sort
of

01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
straighten out things that were that
 
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
straighten out things that were that
happened

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly from the merger uh
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they need to look at minnesota is
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
another example
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
i spoke to the gentleman who was the
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
head of the minnesota system and and
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
they talked about the fact that it's
 
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.589 align:start position:0%
they talked about the fact that it's
taken

01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
quite a number of years to recognize the
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
regional value of the community colleges
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
and to go back to that so i'm not aware
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
of um a plan being put in place
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh and then people looking at it and
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
saying nope we
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't go forward and and do this
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's probably um how
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
urgent folks thought the situation was
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm keenly aware
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the negative impact on community
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
colleges when this goes forward
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
too quickly um and the the things that
 
01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
too quickly um and the the things that
make

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
community colleges community colleges
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
are lost
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
great thank you susan thank you thank
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
you very much uh susan i i got one
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
comment here
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh you recently through the community
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
college i had a report
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
put together by the national center for
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
higher education management systems and
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
cases they looked at was connecticut and
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
you've indicated
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
earlier here that you have had
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
familiarity with that system down there
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
did they have when they went into a
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
merger process
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
was there any uh time frames
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
which you you see them transitioning and
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
similar to what vermont did with their
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
is what are we looking at in terms of
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
time frame for the community college
 
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.710 align:start position:0%
time frame for the community college
system

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
in connecticut or in vermont well
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not really familiar with connecticut
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm somewhat familiar with what happened
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
over with linden
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
and all those over in vermont with the
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
bridge year
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
was there any support in other words did
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
they plan on doing this all in one year
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
or was it
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
phased in by elements okay
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
um in connecticut the original plan was
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
like a five-year plan and they've
 
01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:16.950 align:start position:0%
like a five-year plan and they've
obviously

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
tremendously exceeded that there was a
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
plan to look at the community colleges
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
first and to make
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
decisions about them and then to move on
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
to the csus the connecticut state
 
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.309 align:start position:0%
to the csus the connecticut state
universities

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
universities
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
um but that again they're far outside of
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
their plan
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
um connecticut is a
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
the connecticut system is a heavily
 
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.029 align:start position:0%
the connecticut system is a heavily
unionized

01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
unionized
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh system um there's an organization
 
01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
uh system um there's an organization
called

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
cbac which is the state employees
 
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.029 align:start position:0%
cbac which is the state employees
bargaining

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
coalition and so
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
um i would say that
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh because the plan didn't begin with
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with all of the
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
um stakeholders that
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh they ended up with a significant
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
um opposition which continues
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
to this day uh and so
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
again as a plan is being formulated i
 
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.029 align:start position:0%
again as a plan is being formulated i
would

01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know suggest that the various
 
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.630 align:start position:0%
you know suggest that the various
stakeholders

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
be included in the planning process
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
at one point to do that but because the
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
plan had been set forward as you know
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
this is going to be our timeline
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to accomplish
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't able
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
to be accomplished because the
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
opposition rose up fiercely
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
and early thank you very much
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
i i think one last from representative
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
miller and then we're going to move into
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh catherine provincial and joe moran
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead bro are you you gotta unmute
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
yourself now
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you rick uh susan one of the
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
things that that's become
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
clear in the people that we've been
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
talking with is is a concern of the
 
01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
talking with is is a concern of the
timing

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
timing
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
of um trying to put this together the
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
governor made the
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
announcement at the budget meaning
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's some questions about whether
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's the appropriate procedure to do
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
it through the budget
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
an outside person the point is we've
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
been hearing from people to say that's
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
time the dilemma that we have right now
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
is that both systems
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
are looking for a chancellor and so
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
this this uh uncertainty of where we are
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh comes into that conversation and i'm
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to ask the same question
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
of of the university system
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
if we sure decide to go ahead with the
 
01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:46.630 align:start position:0%
if we sure decide to go ahead with the
system

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
could each of these systems place their
 
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:49.990 align:start position:0%
could each of these systems place their
search

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
search
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
on hold until we figure out exactly
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
where we're going to go with this
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
because it would seem to me it's going
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
to be difficult to
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
hire somebody into a chancellor position
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
with the unknown factor of exactly where
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
we are going with this so
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
the question to you susan is would the
 
01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:08.630 align:start position:0%
the question to you susan is would the
uh

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
would the ccsnh system
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going to go forward with
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
this plan put their search
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
on hold now i know that puts you in a
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
compromising position because of july
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be retired again
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
but from just from a theoretical
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
but from just from a theoretical
standpoint

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
is that something that that you think
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
that the system would
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
place on hold yeah i actually don't have
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be theoretical about this
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative miler we had a a meeting
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday of our board
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we're going ahead with our
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
chancellor's search and offering the
 
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:42.789 align:start position:0%
chancellor's search and offering the
two-year

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
contract because in reading the language
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
as it exists in the bill
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the new entity the new system would
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
be created july
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
2023 um we had as you know
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
begun a search for a chancellor in the
 
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.549 align:start position:0%
begun a search for a chancellor in the
fall

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
and um we have approximately 70
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
applications we're working with a search
 
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.270 align:start position:0%
applications we're working with a search
firm

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so what our initial thought was was
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to continue with an interim
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
chancellor because
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
the way that we're organized as a is as
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
a system
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
and we need a ceo given how our
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
again our system operates we
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
were going to cancel the search and we
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
talked with the principal of the search
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
firm and he said
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
people are not frightened by this we've
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
been keeping them informed
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
all the way through about what the
 
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.630 align:start position:0%
all the way through about what the
status

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the system is and in fact there are
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
quite a number of people uh who are
 
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.990 align:start position:0%
quite a number of people uh who are
applicants

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
who see this as an exciting opportunity
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
a two-year window to work on the
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
creation of this
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
or the you know whatever is going to
 
01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.190 align:start position:0%
or the you know whatever is going to
happen

01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
is not daunting so yesterday our
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
board voted and we've let the governor's
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
office know
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
on going forward with our search and
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
bringing somebody in this summer
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
to be the chancellor with the clear
 
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
to be the chancellor with the clear
understanding

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
that this is a two-year contract and we
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
are not making any promises
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
about anything going forward
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's that's very
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
clear uh joe i see you just put your
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to respond to this
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
particular question
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know if you if you if you
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
place yourselves in in the seed of the
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
future board
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
as it's going through this transitional
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
especially it would be enormously
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
helpful for that board
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
if ccsnh had a chancellor um
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
and if unfortunately it isn't going to
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
be susan having somebody
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
in place will make the what's going to
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
be a very challenging task
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
more manageable than if immediately
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
the new board is going to have to have
 
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
the new board is going to have to have
seven

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
ccs and h institutions and four usna
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
institutions reporting in so
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of wisdom in what
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
what susan is describing the
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the ccs imaging board has decided on
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i should clarify what i said i
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
had said the board it's the executive
 
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.470 align:start position:0%
had said the board it's the executive
committee

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much dr heward uh
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
with that i think we're going to
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
transition now and i don't know
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh protocol here whether i introduce the
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
chancellor first or
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the chair of the trustees uh
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
organizational structure here

and as i understand our
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
charge it is to try to give you a very
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
specific sense
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
of why we feel our board feels so much
 
01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:10.149 align:start position:0%
of why we feel our board feels so much
urgency

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
urgency
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
about about the
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
challenges facing higher ed and why we
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
very quickly and unanimously
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
voted in support of the governor's
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
proposal let me just give you a word
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
about background from
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
my own background i was ceo of albany
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
international for 12 years i was
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for bringing
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
the company as a public company bringing
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the company's headquarters
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
here to new hampshire and uh
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
starting up that big operation in
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
rochester the big aerospace operation
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
before that i was president of bentley
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
university and before that
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
dean and a professor of business
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
strategy at rpi and prior to that i
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
spent my year starting part of a career
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
in ge and working in
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
president reagan science a president
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
reagan science advisor
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
i've so i've spent my whole career
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
really bouncing back and forth between
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
business and university and always
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
working that interface and so
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the reason i joined the board was
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
because when i was
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get that plant in rochester
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
started up and we needed to recruit 500
 
01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:12.950 align:start position:0%
started up and we needed to recruit 500
people

01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
i spent my team like my entire life
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
struggling with the problem of
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
finding enough talent to get this thing
 
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
finding enough talent to get this thing
going

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire spent a lot of
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
time working with great bay we set up a
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
training program
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
for associates who would be ready for
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
the factory floor spent a lot of time
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
with unh working on trying to find
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
engineers and scientists for r d
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
um we spent a ton of time trying to find
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
bachelors and masters of industrial
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
engineering who could
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
play the supervisory role in laying out
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
and leading those plants and
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
they were great partners and but by and
 
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
they were great partners and but by and
large

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
we had to go outside for a ton of the
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
new talent because it just wasn't
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
available within state
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it cost us a lot uh we actually
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
decided in the end
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
not to bring over our finance and
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
accounting group was 50 really good pay
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
really good paying jobs that we left
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
back in albany because it just wasn't
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
the talent available here
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't because uh public higher
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
ed wasn't a great talent
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
a great partner both a and unh it's just
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
the talent wasn't there wasn't enough of
 
01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
the talent wasn't there wasn't enough of
it

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
and so when the governor gave me the
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to join the board i jumped
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
at it because i thought here was a
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
from the inside actively work the
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
problem of trying to promote
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the pathways between public higher ed
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
and states employers
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
who are trying to create the kinds of
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
new jobs that really make a difference
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the state higher value jobs
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and so if i sound a little passionate
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm about to tell you
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's because of that experience um
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
the punchline uh of what i'm about to
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
say is this
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
higher ed's is facing an existential
 
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
higher ed's is facing an existential
threat

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
threat
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh and that threat is accelerating we're
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
just at the front end of it and it's
 
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.510 align:start position:0%
just at the front end of it and it's
already

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
daunting um we are out of time as
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
dr burks described earlier
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
if we had started this five years ago
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
which is when
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
ross cattell started warning us about
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
what was coming
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
if we had started then to plan uh
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
we'd be in much better shape right now
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
but that time is done we're
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're out of time and you'll see that as
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
particularly as you look at the
 
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.830 align:start position:0%
particularly as you look at the
financials

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
financials
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
there is a ton of planning that's
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
required a ton
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i think um i think susan gave you a
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
great sense
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
of just the long list of challenges that
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
are going to have to be navigated to try
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
to do this right but the question is not
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
should there be planning but rather who
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
should be doing
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
planning and what in in my experience
 
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:02.950 align:start position:0%
planning and what in in my experience
across

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
multiple sectors from what i've seen in
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
other states in higher ed
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
when it works best and i think don
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned this with pennsylvania when it
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
works best the people doing the planning
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
are the people responsible for the
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
managing and the implementation
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's you you got to think about this
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
as taking a 30-foot sailboat and trying
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
to chart your way from hope from
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
honolulu to san francisco
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
through a series of monsoons and yes you
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
got to have the long-term plan
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
but you got to manage your way through
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
the monsoons or you never get there
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
and you're constantly adjusting your
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
short-term plans
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
because of the because of the monsoon
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
and adjusting the long-term plan
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
because of how you had to deal with the
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
monsoon the short term
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
so having the right board in place
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
that then has the task that hires the
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
right ceo
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that then has the task of charting
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
through both short term and
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
long term is the right way to get on
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
particularly if you're in crisis and
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're in crisis
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's why and we have an acute
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
sense of it
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
on our board and that's why we came out
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
so quickly
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and forcefully in favor of
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal to put together
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
a board
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative of the two systems get
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
them to hire a ceo and then get on with
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
this task and as he in his words
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
and if you don't you're going to get
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
crushed i think that's also why the
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
four commissioners serving on the two
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
boards just forcefully
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
endorsed the governor's plan same reason
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of you know
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
our hair is on fire we gotta get on with
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
this too late to talk
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the punch line let
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
me let me back up here a bit and
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
um kathy and i are just gonna walk you
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
through some slides that give you some
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
concrete data and it's the same data
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at support
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and honestly every other good board
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
and leadership
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
system leadership group in the country
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
is is looking at at the same time
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
struggling with so the starting point
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
for this whole conversation
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
is the demographic challenge facing
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
higher ed
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the upper left-hand
 
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the upper left-hand
curve

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
curve
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
look at the purple line which is the
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line that's
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
northeast united states that's the pool
 
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
northeast united states that's the pool
of

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
students or people available
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
or higher ed over the next
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
25 years over the next 20 years and you
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
can see
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
that that purple line is us and so
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a dip
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
and this is all calibrated to 2018. so
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
2018 is 100
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
so you can see there's a drop of right
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
away from 2018 to 2020 then there's a
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of breathing space and then
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
whoa the thing drops up through the
 
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.390 align:start position:0%
whoa the thing drops up through the
floor

01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
and never recovers that's 100
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
predictable because it's just based on
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
the number of people who have been born
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's no uncertainty about that now
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
um just a few points to highlight here
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
first ired has been
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
in growth mode since the gi bill
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh immediately after world war ii with a
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
couple of blips along the way
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
it has always been growing because
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the baby boom uh and beyond
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
the the number of people going to
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
college had always been growing
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is unprecedented it hasn't happened
 
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.790 align:start position:0%
this is unprecedented it hasn't happened
ever

01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the scale involved here is very hard
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
for people to get their heads around
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
you need to be thinking textile industry
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or paper industry you
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
know decades ago
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
or think bricks and mortar retailing
 
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
or think bricks and mortar retailing
today

01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's that kind of a magnitude of a
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
change and higher ed is not ready for it
 
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.149 align:start position:0%
change and higher ed is not ready for it
because

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
everybody who's grown up in higher ed
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
has been thinking grow grow grow
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
second point and this is one people in
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
higher don't talk about
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
there is a food chain in higher ed
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are the elite schools and the even
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
if you saw an article today in wall
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
street journal
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh elite schools are being buried with
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
applications right
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
beneath the elite schools they're the
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
schools ranked 50th to 100
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
then there are the regional colleges the
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
usnh institutions that are ranked below
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
the hundredth
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then the two-year schools the elites
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the 50-100 are going to be fined
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
through this they're facing the same
 
01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:41.430 align:start position:0%
through this they're facing the same
demographics

01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
but all they need to do is if they're
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
having trouble filling their class
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
they just cherry-picked down from
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
students who in the past from
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
from to schools pulling away students
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
who in the past wouldn't have gotten
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
into the elite
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
so if mit and harvard have a problem
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
which they won't they'll just
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
they'll just cherry pick from tufts in
 
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.189 align:start position:0%
they'll just cherry pick from tufts in
bc

01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
bc
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and tufts and bc have a problem they're
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
just going to cherry pick
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
you northeastern and umass amherst
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
and umass lowell and if those have a
 
01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
and umass lowell and if those have a
problem

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're just going to turn around and
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
cherry-pick unh
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
and maine and if unh and maine have a
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
problem they're going to carry picane
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
and plymouth and keene plymouth have a
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
problem they're going to cherry-pick
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
an hti in manchester and the data says
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's already happening so the farther
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
down the
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
food chain you are and public higher in
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is farther down the food
 
01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:33.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is farther down the food
chain

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
chain
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the harder the impact this demographic
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
is going to have
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
now you can see on the lower right hand
 
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.390 align:start position:0%
now you can see on the lower right hand
side

01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
the two-year institutions across the
 
01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
the two-year institutions across the
country

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
but and especially in the northeast are
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
getting hit
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
even harder there isn't quite that flat
 
01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
even harder there isn't quite that flat
curve

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
curve
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
through the first half of this decade
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
and it drops hard
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
same trend we're seeing it across the
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
country uh
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it in today's application
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
trends both in state and across the
 
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
trends both in state and across the
northeast

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
northeast
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
you should hear some of the stories from
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
suny now
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh if you go one more slide kathy
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is being hit especially
 
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is being hit especially
hard

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
hard
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i i thought this i thought you this
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
was particularly interesting
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
these are slides from the
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements of ccsnh in
 
01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:26.390 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements of ccsnh in
2018.

01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
and this is you know this is what ross
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
was telling us back then and we weren't
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
listening hard enough
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know what he what he was arguing and
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh the 2018 auditor financial statement
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
what he said is look there are three
 
01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
what he said is look there are three
drivers

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
of enrollment um or
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
for ccsnh and he could have said for
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
usnh as well
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
um it's employment it's
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know if the employment rate is very
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
high we have more trouble recruiting
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
number two is the number of students
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
graduating from new hampshire high
 
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
graduating from new hampshire high
schools

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
and number three is competition from
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
other institutions so think
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that process is just subscribing
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
so here is in 2018 the forecast
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
for the decline in the number of high
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
school graduates in new hampshire
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2032
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's completely consistent with the
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
demographic chart i just showed you
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
the the bad news here is new hampshire
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
is getting hit even harder than the rest
 
01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:29.189 align:start position:0%
is getting hit even harder than the rest
of

01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
than the rest of new england as you can
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
see on the right hand side he was he was
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
predicting basically a 26
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of high school
 
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of high school
graduates

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
graduates
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
who would that would be available for
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
all of us in public higher ed to recruit
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
over the next 15 years now the data in
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
2020 that just came out from the
 
01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
2020 that just came out from the
chronicle

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
chronicle
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
what it'll tell you is looking out just
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
the states that the state that is going
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have it toughest
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
is connecticut it's going to be down 17
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
percent number of high school graduates
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
number two in the country new hampshire
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
with a 15
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
line uh maine is at 10 percent
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is an 8 percent decline
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
vermont is seven percent decline we are
 
01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
vermont is seven percent decline we are
getting

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
clobbered there's no hiding from it
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
this is like gravity
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
now i wish i could tell you that that
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
was the entirety of the problem
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's only half the problem kathy
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
if you look inside the shrinking pool of
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
what you learn what you see and the
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
data's overwhelming here is it's a
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's a much poorer pool and a pool
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
of shrinking pool of people who need
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
greater financial aid
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
and that's because of the demographic
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
composition there are
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
the the number of minority families that
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
higher ed is serving grows from about
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh 29 of the total in
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh 2000 to 45 percent by 2018
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's even higher now the number of
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
immigrant families first generation
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
immigrant families that higher ed
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
is serving was something like 20 percent
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
of the total population
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
in 2000 it's 28 of the total population
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and that continues to grow too
 
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and that continues to grow too
so

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
the net result is as the number of
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
students therefore the amount of tuition
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
is steadily declining
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
with gravity demographic gravity
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of financial aid that we have
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
to pay to that shrinking pool
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
is growing so here you can see this is
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
just over a short period of time
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
the growth of financial aid that usnh
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
has paid as a result of this change in
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
the population
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
so you get a double whammy here net
 
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
so you get a double whammy here net
revenue

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
net tuition revenue is being hit both
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
by this waterfall of shrinking high
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
school graduates
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
and by the need for increasing financial
 
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.470 align:start position:0%
and by the need for increasing financial
aid

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
to support those students so if you go
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the next curve next slide
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
joe if i could just make one more point
 
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.070 align:start position:0%
joe if i could just make one more point
we

01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
um project that that blue line is going
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to increase but to joe's
 
01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.229 align:start position:0%
to continue to increase but to joe's
point

01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
remember there's more aid being
 
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
remember there's more aid being
distributed

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
to fewer students because the the head
 
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
to fewer students because the the head
count

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
count
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
is on the decline but the aid is on the
 
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
is on the decline but the aid is on the
increase

01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in a minute in the next
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
right there yeah and and
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know the point you just can't
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
emphasize enough we're barely at the
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
front end of this
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
that cliff hits in 2025 2026
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a multi-year clip so if you
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
look on the left hand side of the curve
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
slide here this is just uh the the top
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
curve the blue curve is usnh's
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
net tuition rev uh is
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
net tuition revenue so
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know leave aside room and board
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
leave aside contracts and grants
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that net revenue at
 
01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that net revenue at
the

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
front end of this crisis
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
is already shrinking by about eight
 
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
is already shrinking by about eight
percent

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
and close to you know 28 million dollars
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
in a very short period of time now
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
the next curve is the red curve is
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
state appropriation and you can see that
 
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:27.430 align:start position:0%
state appropriation and you can see that
while

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
our net revenue has come down by by
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
about 28 million
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
state appropriations have held steady
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
but then have happily increased a little
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
bit but you can see not
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
nearly enough to offset
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
the impact of the demographic of the
 
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
the impact of the demographic of the
clients

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
clients
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
now the the net result
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
is the gray bars we're seeing rapidly
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
shrinking margins you know when i first
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
started on the board we used to
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
we used to be accustomed to three
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
percent operating margins
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh because of this decline even as we're
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
holding the line on cost
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh you can see our margins begin to slip
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
from one and a half percent to
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
point seven percent this year uh fiscal
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
year twenty one
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you exclude the effect of covet so
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at a negative two
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
percent now
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've got a major restructuring plan to
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
try to get get us back to break even by
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
next year but
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind these trends continue so
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know we project out for 2022 and 23
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
further declines in net revenue kathy
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
what are we
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
what are we expecting in 22 and 23s
 
01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
what are we expecting in 22 and 23s
probably

01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
in total operating revenue we're looking
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
at a nine percent decline
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
from 20 from 20 to 23. nine
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
nine percent decline in operating
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
revenue and again
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is just gravity there's no there's
 
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
this is just gravity there's no there's
none

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's not you can't pretend it's not
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
happening because it's happening
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
and that still leaves us well before we
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
hit that demographic cliff
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
now you know we don't have as much
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
access to as much data
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
over on the ccs and h side but if you
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
look at the published data
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the audited financials you see
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same trend
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
so net tuition revenue the blue line
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
very short period of
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
time shrinks from 47.9 million dollars
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
to 39 million and uh
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
fy 21 the the audited fy 20 audited
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
statement said enrollment for fy21 is
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
down another 11 percent
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
happily for the state for the well-being
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature stepped up and has
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
support for ccsnh going from 43.8
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
million appropriations
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
to 57 million appropriations so in that
 
01:26:47.199 --> 01:26:48.149 align:start position:0%
to 57 million appropriations so in that
case

01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
the state has been able to offset the
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
sharp decline uh due to demographics
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
but remember we're at the front end of
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
this so that increase in state
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation is going to have to
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
continue at pretty much that pace
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh in order to offset this um
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
tsunami that we're all being hit with
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
now just just i just want to make a few
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
more points
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
um if you go to the next slide
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
heading into this storm in a position of
 
01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:26.550 align:start position:0%
heading into this storm in a position of
disadvantage

01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're in about as weak a position
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
as there is in the country so you know
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
you start by saying
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
by looking at the number of high school
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
graduates from this state that leave the
 
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.430 align:start position:0%
graduates from this state that leave the
state

01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
to go to school and you know from an
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
employer's perspective once they leave
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's that much harder and that much more
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
expensive to get them back so
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
you look at students high school
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
students leaving
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
to to enroll in schools outside of
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it's it's almost 60
 
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.629 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it's it's almost 60
percent

01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
of our high school graduates and don't
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
forget ross's chart
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a rapidly shrinking
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
pool of high school graduates
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
and if we continue to lose at that rate
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is going to get very hard even when
 
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.390 align:start position:0%
this is going to get very hard even when
you

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
even when you include two two years so
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
students enrolling both in two and four
 
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.070 align:start position:0%
students enrolling both in two and four
year

01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're still the number two exporter of
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh second point another
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh background point if uh kathy if you
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
move to the next slide
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're entering into this crisis as
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
um as the second most expensive
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
public higher education institute for
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition in the country
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
so the right way to look at this curve
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
is the blue lines this is for four-year
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
tuition for your schools
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
the blue line blue bars represent
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition the orange bars
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
represent out-of-state tuition so you
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
add them together to get
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
total tuition but what i want to draw
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
your attention to is the blue curve so
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
this eye chart here new hampshire is is
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
the second from the right so we're the
 
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.270 align:start position:0%
the second from the right so we're the
second

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
most expensive tuition
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
for public higher education in the
 
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
for public higher education in the
country

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
now if you go next slides
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
same is true for our two years so what
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is telling you
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
is not just part of the explanation why
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
so many of
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
our high school students are leaving but
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is no way
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
that public higher ed in this state can
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
address this revenue crisis by
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
increasing tuition
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is no way so
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and if we tried
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
the market will just throw it right back
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
at us because of the competitive factors
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we have to find a way of offsetting
 
01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:58.709 align:start position:0%
so we have to find a way of offsetting
this

01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
rapidly shrinking net tuition revenue
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
with at best holding tuition flat now in
 
01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.350 align:start position:0%
with at best holding tuition flat now in
truth

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
truth
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
we ought to be cutting tuition precisely
 
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
we ought to be cutting tuition precisely
because

01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's so expensive and if we if we're
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
serious about reversing the trend of the
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
loss of high school students we better
 
01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.709 align:start position:0%
loss of high school students we better
start

01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
by lowering tuition and making the
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
public higher ed in the state more
 
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
public higher ed in the state more
affordable

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very very hard to do
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
that at a time when our net revenue is
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
is crashing on us now on the other hand
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
if you were one of the schools off on
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
the left hand side of the curve
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
you can see or even in the middle of the
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
curve you can see you've got room there
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
to maybe
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh increase tuition some and have
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
students bear more of the cost
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
as as the revenue crisis hits but
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
there's just no way
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to do that
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh last slide or last background slide
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
um another reason that we're entering
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
into this
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
crisis in a position of disadvantage is
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
we are overbuilt
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
relatively overbuilt for public higher
 
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.149 align:start position:0%
relatively overbuilt for public higher
education

01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so this this chart just simply
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.229 align:start position:0%
so this this chart just simply
calculates

01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
calculates
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
the the ratio of population
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
to number of institutions in higher
 
01:31:17.199 --> 01:31:18.310 align:start position:0%
to number of institutions in higher
education

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
so utah has and if you look at the right
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
hand column
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's the population of people under
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
25. so utah has
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
the largest population being served by
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
the smallest number of institutions
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're 45 first on that curve so we have
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
for a relatively small
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
numerator population a relatively large
 
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
numerator population a relatively large
denominator

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
denominator
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
number of institutions 11 that are
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
serving public higher education and you
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
can look at the
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
states that are rated lower than us they
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
tend to have a lot of
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
dispersed geographical requirements so
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
so we're um we're exporting more than
 
01:31:56.639 --> 01:31:57.510 align:start position:0%
so we're um we're exporting more than
anybody

01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're more expensive than just about
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
everybody except for vermont
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and we're starting in an overbuilt
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
position that's not a great place to be
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
to address what's going to be a really
 
01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
to address what's going to be a really
profound

01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
profound
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh generational uh revenue crisis in
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
now um kathy you go to the next slide um
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
all of this i know you know this all of
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is dramatically exacerbated and
 
01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
this is dramatically exacerbated and
probably

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
accelerating by accelerated by the
 
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.790 align:start position:0%
accelerating by accelerated by the
pandemic

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
so what the pandemic is doing is
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
is creating smaller enrollments of
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
incoming students
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's creating weaker retention of
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
existing students
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it means because we've spread out
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
our campuses fewer students
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
utilizing campus room and board which is
 
01:32:46.159 --> 01:32:48.470 align:start position:0%
utilizing campus room and board which is
another

01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
source of revenue and therefore loss of
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
revenue at the same time because of the
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
economic impact particularly on the
 
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
economic impact particularly on the
lowest

01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
lowest
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the poorest segments of society
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is what public higher education in
 
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
which is what public higher education in
general

01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
and two years in particular that's their
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
mission to serve
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are hardest hit by
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
by this those students that who years
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
and public higher ed are facing
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
serving they're the ones that are
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
hardest hit by this
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
by this pandemic and then of course
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
institutions are
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
having to take on much higher costs some
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
of them offset by the government
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's because of trying to preserve
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
safety but what's the short-term impact
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
well for us nh the short-term impact for
 
01:33:29.679 --> 01:33:31.189 align:start position:0%
well for us nh the short-term impact for
us

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
is 136 million dollars of code-related
 
01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:34.629 align:start position:0%
is 136 million dollars of code-related
losses

01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
losses
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
offset by about 61 million of stimulus
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
and gopher
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get through it and we think we get
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
by careful cash management we think we
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
can get through without having to
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
liquidate any of our endowment to cover
 
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
liquidate any of our endowment to cover
losses

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
losses
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
but there's a long-term impact on this
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
as well and the long-term impact is
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're depleting our cash reserves
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you were to get through this day's
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
cash on hand than we did before
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
the smaller classes during the pandemic
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know they become sophomores and
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
juniors and seniors and as
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
as their upperclassmen counterparts
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
graduate we're left with a fundamentally
 
01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
graduate we're left with a fundamentally
strong

01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
smaller pool of students that we're
 
01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
smaller pool of students that we're
serving

01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
serving
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
the loss of family income during the
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic it takes time as we learned in
 
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.669 align:start position:0%
pandemic it takes time as we learned in
2008-2009

01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
2008-2009
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
to rebuild that that income and that
 
01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
to rebuild that that income and that
means

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
more need for financial aid than we
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have had
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
and so our fear is what happens here
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
is the pandemic at least for us nh
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
probably wipes out
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
that flat period of the demographic
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
curve where we were telling ourselves
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
would have some breathing space for a
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
few years before
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
having to take on that demographic cliff
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that joe and that's that's why
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
last spring you know we had been
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
planning for this
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the headwinds coming but last
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
spring it took on a new sense of urgency
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
and this wholesale restructuring
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
project to take 10 out of our cost
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
structure by 2023
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
was absolutely necessary and we have
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
that roadmap we're on that the
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
the other uh follow up to joe's point
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at probably a hundred
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars of our cash
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
being depleted over the course of the
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic we've had to pull back on all
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
capital spending and we had built up
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
reserves we
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
we pretty much take care of our own
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
capital needs
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
and um that will be effectively wiped
 
01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.310 align:start position:0%
and um that will be effectively wiped
out

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
by the time we're to 2023. for good
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
reason for good reason but it's just the
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
the reality of where we are right now so
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
let less
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh less slides um which is
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
the next which really gets to what
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
kathy's just saying because
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the long-term structural trends
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and the looming pandemic we launched
 
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.390 align:start position:0%
um and the looming pandemic we launched
a

01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
significant restructuring plan that
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
called for taking out ten percent of
 
01:36:04.719 --> 01:36:05.590 align:start position:0%
called for taking out ten percent of
costs

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
on our campuses and the goal really was
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
to very overtly offset
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
both the combination of these
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
demographic trends and the pandemic we
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
were willing to
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
suffer through significant losses during
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
in order to keep our people safe but we
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
do during the pandemic whatever it was
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
to get us back to break even by 22 and
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
get us a small margin by 23.
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so that that so we are right in the
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
middle of a major restructuring program
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
which the basic approach is we're
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
rolling back our expenses to fiscal year
 
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.750 align:start position:0%
rolling back our expenses to fiscal year
2019

01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
we're restructuring our benefits we're
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
consolidating doing a major
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
consolidation of our back
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
back office administrative functions
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's significant rebalancing going on
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
of our academic programs on each of the
 
01:36:56.639 --> 01:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
of our academic programs on each of the
campuses

01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are at least 500
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
roughly 500 faculty and staff who are
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
through a voluntary separation
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
retirement program who are leaving who
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
are choosing to retire
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there will be some
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
involuntary separations as well
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
but we're talking a radical
 
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
but we're talking a radical
restructuring

01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
it and uh which for us and for
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
most other institutions is unprecedented
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
in scope
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
scale on schedule you're not hearing
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
much about it which just gives you a
 
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
much about it which just gives you a
sense

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
of uh a shared
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the urgency that higher
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
ed is facing over the
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
across our system in campuses you know
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
you think about
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
think about all of the visibility there
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
was two years three years ago when unh
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
try to um
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
try to reduce its workforce by 15
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
in modern languages and and the heat
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
that ccsnh took
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
by by making up taking a very necessary
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
step of reducing 10 of their people
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking north of 500 people
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
and it so far on schedule
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
and most of those people are leaving
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
voluntarily because of a package were
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
put together for them
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
that's the good news the bad news if we
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
do everything right
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we get lucky with this year's
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
incoming class
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we will get lucky this only
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
catches us up to those trends
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't this doesn't get us ahead
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
catches us up
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's taking out 70 million dollars just
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
to catch up to the decline in net
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
revenues that were
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
that that are pretty much locked in uh
 
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
that that are pretty much locked in uh
already

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so the hard work is ahead of us
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
and now we know our brethren
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
at ccsnh are going through the same
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
thing but it'll be worse for them
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
just because of all of the things i've
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so as we look at that as a board
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
we say look we can we we can do
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
everything possible to optimize within
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of usnh
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
but if we take our you know if we put on
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
our hats as fiduciaries for state
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
clearly there are many more ways that
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
move to optimally serve the citizens of
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
the state if you take
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
both systems together and try to and try
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
to optimize
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
as one unified system and don gave you
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
an example of how there's so much more
 
01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:30.229 align:start position:0%
an example of how there's so much more
that

01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
white mountain and and plymouth could be
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing if we didn't have the governance
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
barriers that we do
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
now it's not going to be easy it's going
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult but and it's going to be
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
doing it through crisis constantly
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
but that's why we say start with a
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
unified board
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
start with a ceo-type chancellor
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
get everyone understanding the scale of
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
and then let's work together to navigate
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
through the many many legitimate issues
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
and questions that
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
that susan and don laid out there is
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
something very significant the
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislature can do
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
to help public higher ed get to a
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable place as i tell you right
 
01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
sustainable place as i tell you right
now

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
we i'll speak for myself i don't believe
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
right now new public higher education in
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
is on a path to sustainable to a
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable future to a financially
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
viable future
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's on a path to a to a cliff
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
the best thing that the legislature
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
could do to support public higher
 
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.629 align:start position:0%
could do to support public higher
education

01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
during this crisis is to give public
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
higher ed
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
a cushion to give
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
this new board time to work through the
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
many issues
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
that it's going to have to address if on
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
day one
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be dealing with
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
budget cuts
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time that they're going to
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
have to navigate through the
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
hangover of the pandemic and the
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
continuing demographic trends
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to be really tough so
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there well i
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just add not not just the budget
 
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.629 align:start position:0%
i'll just add not not just the budget
cuts

01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh the community college system and
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
university system put a
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal note together for this
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
section of house bill 2 that
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
that this board is going to need
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
some external support and the resources
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
to bring in some external support to
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
really think through
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative luna the business plan
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
the workflows the strategic vision the
 
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.430 align:start position:0%
the workflows the strategic vision the
timeline

01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
um so i wholeheartedly agree with
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
with the joe's statement we've mentioned
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
this to division two
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
and to the governor's office that now is
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
not the time to cut the appropriation
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
when this hard work is ahead
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
and there's there's going to need to be
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
some investment dollars
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
i guess we can stop sharing yeah
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh joe and
 
01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh joe and

please email that out to all committee
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
members absolutely
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um are there questions for
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
dr moran and uh catherine provencher
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
i can remember joe that my father used
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
to work for globe
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
albany and that's not the same as albany
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
international is it
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's not no i think we talked about that
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
once yeah
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
let's go on rep representative moffat do
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah sure real quick for any of the
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh panelists uh the president
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh and others who campaigned for
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
president uh i'm looking at some of the
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
recent uh news items uh the president
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
campaigned on a pla he has a plan to
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
make community college
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
and four-year public colleges uh free
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
tuition for them
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
so uh he's new
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
his administration is no but in terms of
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
the president's plan
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
to uh make tuition free for for your
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
organizations uh is there anything that
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
you see flowing from this that would
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
susan you want me to take that or you
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to take that well you could start
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
and then i'll chime in
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh i i think we
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
we find it pretty scary uh the the
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
prospect here
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
is i mean this has to be thought through
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
very carefully if um
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
if you have an increase in students
 
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
if you have an increase in students
without

01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the resources to support them
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
it it becomes the worst of unfunded
 
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.629 align:start position:0%
it it becomes the worst of unfunded
mandates

01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
um if if um
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not paying tuition but
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
you've got to support them
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
um if uh the
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement for the students
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
is linked to the national averages
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get slammed so in other
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
words if
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
if there's a i mean the goal is really
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
worthy don't get me wrong i mean you
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
want to get to
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
65 by 25 this is the way to do it and
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know my
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
the first instinct is to stand up and
 
01:44:44.639 --> 01:44:46.310 align:start position:0%
the first instinct is to stand up and
cheer

01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
cheer
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
but you've got to look at the details
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
because it could really get us in
 
01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:49.990 align:start position:0%
because it could really get us in
trouble

01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
let's take for example this again we're
 
01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
let's take for example this again we're
uniquely

01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
uniquely
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
ill positioned for this because of our
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
high cost of tuition
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
so what's there's no way they're going
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
to reward
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
less efficient institutions by saying
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you charge 17 000 a year
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to be reimbursed 17 000 a
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
year for the students that were letting
 
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
year for the students that were letting
in

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be well the national
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
average is 5000 maybe we'll make a
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
regional adjustment
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's what you're going to get for each
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
student so
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't solve the demographic
 
01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.390 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't solve the demographic
problem

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
it may make our our mismatch between
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
revenue and costs a lot worse than it
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
is if it's not really careful
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and i would comment that
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
the free tuition uh plays out in
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
different ways in different states
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
whether we're talking about the
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
kentucky promise so the the tennessee
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
program and so on
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes that program is aimed at
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
full-time students who are recent high
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
school graduates
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's not the population of our
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
our uh 70 something percent of our
 
01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.030 align:start position:0%
our uh 70 something percent of our
population

01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
is 22 24
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
or older our average age is about 27. so
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
the question for me
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
would be how this is going to play out
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
i would say right now i'm more
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
interested in the proposal to double
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
the pell allotment
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that would continue to serve all of
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
our students because if you're a
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
part-time student
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
your allotment would be adjusted but it
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
would still pay more
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
than is currently being paid you know
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that our students
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
might have if they were free tuition it
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
was a surprise to me but if you want to
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
go into automotive
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
for example you have to buy your own
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
tools that's about two thousand dollars
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and um we're fortunate to have the
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
medallion fund
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh under the charitable foundation and
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
many students
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
benefit that way but it it is an answer
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
of sorts and of course
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
dr jill biden has been in community
 
01:46:56.159 --> 01:46:56.950 align:start position:0%
dr jill biden has been in community
colleges

01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh forever and so she really does
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
understand the issue it would be great
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
to have the help um you know
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
one of the slides that you saw before uh
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
was produced by
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
roscatel looking at the number of
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
the declining number of high school
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
grads he used that slide with our board
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
to make the point that there are about
 
01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:20.229 align:start position:0%
to make the point that there are about
146

01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
146
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
000 people in this state who have some
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
degree of college credit
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
we should be doing more to go after and
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
serve that population
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
than we've been doing and while i don't
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
dispute the figures
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
i do see a different path forward for
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
once we come through the pandemic
 
01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
once we come through the pandemic
nationally

01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
nobody expected community colleges just
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
to suffer in the way that we have we are
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely on the average
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
and it really is because our students
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
are either essential workers whether
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're lnas or they're in retail
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
um or their parents and they haven't
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
been able to uh balance things
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
the challenge for us at this moment
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
is to help them figure out how they can
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
come back so long answer
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
i i do hope for more money to be coming
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward for instance
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
to another round of tax grants to
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
support our students
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh we are and always have been lean
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
but we are not fragile we find ways to
 
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:19.750 align:start position:0%
but we are not fragile we find ways to
deal

01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
deal
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
with what we have as a situation in
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
i i just one little point here um
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
i just read an article that 25 percent
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
of colleges are going to be out of
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
business here in the next few years
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but i'm looking at some figures i can
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
remember talking with roscatel
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
and here's another article i've just
 
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.350 align:start position:0%
and here's another article i've just
read

01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
between 2001 and 2021
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
tuition tuition for colleges rose 140
 
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.830 align:start position:0%
tuition tuition for colleges rose 140
percent

01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
yet we still continue to have only about
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
62 percent
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
of our folks that are attending college
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
graduating in six years
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that's causing a real whammy in terms
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the cost of education for these kids
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
is there anything we're doing to
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
the number our our percentage for kids
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
that can
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
graduate in six years from the 62
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
percent level and this is a national
 
01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
percent level and this is a national
level

01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know exactly what it may be
 
01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:21.830 align:start position:0%
so i don't know exactly what it may be
for

01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the university of new hampshire or
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
keene or plymouth
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
can somebody help me out net rep
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative vlad
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have the highest graduation rate
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire public four years do
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
than than any other state in new england
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
we publish a dashboard i can get that to
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
to jen it has a
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
number of different metrics but um
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're well above the national average
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire publix for
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
for that six year graduation rate but
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
has our tuition rate also increased at
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that 140 percent over the last year
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
it depends on the time frame uh
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative ladd if you
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you look through
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
the time that uh the good old days
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know when when um you just heard
 
01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:10.950 align:start position:0%
you know when when um you just heard
from

01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh ed mckay during ed mckay's time
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
you just read a letter from uh former
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
trustees who used to be on the board
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
back in those days yeah you'd see
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
you'd see increases three four five
 
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.189 align:start position:0%
you'd see increases three four five
percent

01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then when the state cut its
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
allocation dramatically there were some
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
big increases
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
in tuition with we've fought hard to
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
hold a line on tuition
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the very reason you described for i
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
think the last four years and in our
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
current budget proposal we said we would
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
actually drop tuition if we get an
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
increase in state support
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
inspiring christopher to drop tuition
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
but i know ccs has done a great job
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
holding the line on tuition
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
the the we're still too high and
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
so part of the crisis here is we've got
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
to find a way of lowering the cost
 
01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.629 align:start position:0%
to find a way of lowering the cost
dependence

01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
dependence
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
and tough to do when you're you know
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
your revenue is shrinking so fast but
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's what the goal needs to be
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
um as for the second part of your
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to improve graduation
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
rate you know the
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
i i want to defer to susan and don don's
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
got a lot to say on this subject
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i know susan does too so i'll stop
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh i
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we have to have that
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
answered at this moment but that that
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be a concern i would like to
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
offer the opportunity to others on the
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
committee to ask questions at
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh luna thanks very much
 
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.189 align:start position:0%

and um one of the things that came up at
a

01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
recent advisory board meeting back in
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
february was when uh president mullen
 
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.229 align:start position:0%
february was when uh president mullen
zavisky

01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
zavisky
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussed the nhti strategic plan
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
and she laid out four specific
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
points to it the first one was retention
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
the second one was workforce development
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
the third was effectiveness and
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
sustainability and the fourth was
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to poke specifically on the
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
workforce development one because
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the findings uh they
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
had and that they that they built into
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
their plan
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
was uh reflected the fact that 65 of
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
their students want credentials
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um necessarily two-year
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
degrees or four-year degrees
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
and and so that that pivot um
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
being something that the community
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
colleges can
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
can address on rapidly short order i
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
think is a very
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
um a very good um a good opportunity
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
for our for our community colleges i was
 
01:53:00.159 --> 01:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
for our for our community colleges i was
wondering

01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know given the given the the um
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
precipitous decline
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
in in high school uh
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
graduates uh projected over the next few
 
01:53:11.119 --> 01:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
graduates uh projected over the next few
years

01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
what are you what is the university
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
system seeing in terms of
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
what you're structuring plan and
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
everything but what do your students
 
01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
everything but what do your students
want

01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're it's like you know that's a deep
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
question and there's so many layers to
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
it and again i'll
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
um defer to don for part of the answer
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
the starting point for us is 80 of
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
the population that higher education in
 
01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
this country is serving
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that number is going to grow our
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
non-traditional students
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh so you know the kind of students
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that in the past
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
would uh normally have been the province
 
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:53.990 align:start position:0%
would uh normally have been the province
of

01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
community colleges have become the
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
province of all of higher ed
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the you know the emergence of
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
distance learning
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
makes that makes the concept of
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
education as a lifelong process um
 
01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.610 align:start position:0%
education as a lifelong process um
being

01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:15.620 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
being
[Music]

01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
being attained through a
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
longer periods of time in chunks
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
only some of those some of which
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
are traditional diplomas has become
 
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:37.470 align:start position:0%
um sort of the common expectation
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.629 align:start position:0%
um sort of the common expectation
[Music]

01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh across higher education and so
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
um you know if you look at unh
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
it it's putting a lot of emphasis and
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
look at where its growth is it's in
 
01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.510 align:start position:0%
look at where its growth is it's in
professional

01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
post-baccalaureate programs
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
and it's going in some cases in
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
traditional format and
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
both physically and in degree in some
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
cases far less
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
traditional uh both in format
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
and in in whether it's a credential or
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
even a certificate
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
even something less than financial a
 
01:55:13.679 --> 01:55:15.109 align:start position:0%
even something less than financial a
badge

01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
badge
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
i just got off a zoom call with a major
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
a very well known i won't mention the
 
01:55:21.599 --> 01:55:22.629 align:start position:0%
a very well known i won't mention the
name

01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
and we were doing a brainstorming
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
session on precisely that question
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
is how how do they take advantage of
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
their reputation
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
in a particular field where they're
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
really strong
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
and use it to do everything from
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
host baccalaureate um summer programs
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
to credentials to badges to lifelong
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh coming back and forth every once in a
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
while to distance degrees
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh spread out over a period of time to
 
01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.790 align:start position:0%
uh spread out over a period of time to
distance

01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
distance
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
one-year programs it's become the norm
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
to work through i would say that
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
but you can't you can't expect to
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
navigate through
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
them through the changes without
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
this is an example where under one
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
governance structure
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
we may be able to facilitate rather than
 
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.189 align:start position:0%
we may be able to facilitate rather than
compete

01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
compete
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
so we should if if the community college
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
system is really good
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
at credentialing a certain population
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
of granite staters university system
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
should not be competing and and vice
 
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
should not be competing and and vice
versa

01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
versa
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
let's give a quick example of what we've
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
done in the last year
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually the last six months is start a
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
cyber securities
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
credential and also credential
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
in innovation and entrepreneurship which
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
gives a student
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
all the background experience they need
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
whatever their
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
area of interest is in business that
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
gives them the capability to really run
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
the business
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know but part of the why that
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
question is so deep
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
is um it's a totally different business
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
model and the revenue
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you expect from you know if you're
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
thinking again about this revenue crisis
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
and how you manage institutions
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you get far less revenue from those
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
kind of programs
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
than you did by having 18 to 20 year
 
01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.030 align:start position:0%
than you did by having 18 to 20 year
olds

01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
olds
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
crowded together in a physical location
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
aim for room and board
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um so that's part of the reason this
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
is such a
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
tsunami that you've got to navigate your
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
way through is
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
you can get to that other population but
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
you've got to do it in a way
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
that preserves that maintains the
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
financial viability of your institutions
 
01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:02.229 align:start position:0%
financial viability of your institutions
that's

01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's the hard part right right no i
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that very much joe and and
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
and certainly
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know the differences between the
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
university systems
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
university system colleges and the
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges i mean you just
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned room and board
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know i think nhti you know that's
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
where my familiarity is
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
has a has a pretty lively um um
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know and and robust um
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
um dining services and number you know
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
students on campus
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know i think they have a small
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
students that live on campus i think
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're an outlier in the uh
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
most of the community colleges are not
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
residential institutions
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
but um but uh but they do um
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know have the ability to uh to
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
make up revenue through volume
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
so so um so you know so that's a
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know so i i think that's a that's an
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
area that
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the community colleges i i think
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a have a tremendous opportunity and
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'd hope that we're able to learn more
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
about what the
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
university systems sort of strategic you
 
01:59:15.679 --> 01:59:15.990 align:start position:0%
university systems sort of strategic you
know

01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
pivot is going to be um given that
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
particularly the
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
the available market through the
 
01:59:21.679 --> 01:59:22.709 align:start position:0%
the available market through the
non-traditional

01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
non-traditional
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
um students i i have a question
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
for joe or don or susan or catherine
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
um we when i'm looking at hb2
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now we're dealing
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
with governance
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the makeup of our
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
structure and our organization
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of is has there been
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
any thinking
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the part of the university community
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
college system in terms of
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
timelines in which we're going to be
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
able to achieve
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
all these other policy issues that come
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
along with
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
a change of our governance and so that
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
the system can work
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
and be more affordable so it can be more
 
02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:05.910 align:start position:0%
and be more affordable so it can be more
accessible

02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
so it can meet the challenges of our our
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
our workforce that is forced demands
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
here in the state so
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of timeline are you looking at
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
i've heard susan heward talk about five
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
years for the community college system
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
down in connecticut
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
and they may have to extend that what
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
are we looking
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
at uh in terms of this and we are we
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
doing this in isolation
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
and not working new england is a very
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
small region it's the size of many
 
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:36.390 align:start position:0%
small region it's the size of many
states

02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
in other locations in our country and so
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're competing
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
with for example here i hear don burke
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
saying while we're introducing cyber
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
security well the university of maine
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
southern maine and gorham just
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
introduced the same program are we going
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
to have to start looking
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
beyond our borders several questions in
 
02:00:56.639 --> 02:00:57.750 align:start position:0%
beyond our borders several questions in
there

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
the the um susan you want to go first
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
sorry the the timeline the way we think
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
of the timeline is as follows
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
remember we're doing all this in crisis
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
um the the most
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
important two steps are
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
for each board to intelligently
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
the five most qualified representatives
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
to serve on that new board and there's
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
an equal burden on the governor
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
to pick one hopes from the existing
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
boards five really strong people
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
and then they immediately need to get on
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
with the task of selecting a chancellor
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and that person
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know back to representative miler's
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
question in crisis
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
given the scale of what we got to go
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
through it needs to be a ceo
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh now
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
then they will immediately assign
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
the their legal representative legal
 
02:02:02.239 --> 02:02:03.189 align:start position:0%
the their legal representative legal
counsel

02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
who put to put together a draft of the
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:10.180 align:start position:0%
while the board gets on to
 
02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
while the board gets on to
[Music]

02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-year task it's not a
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
three-year test it's not a five-year
 
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:14.790 align:start position:0%
three-year test it's not a five-year
test

02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a forever task the the
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
process of managing through
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
an unprecedented uh
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
time of change and challenge while
 
02:02:27.599 --> 02:02:29.189 align:start position:0%
time of change and challenge while
preserving

02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
the higher ed missions of the
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the two-year four-year and graduate
 
02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:37.109 align:start position:0%
of the two-year four-year and graduate
programs

02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
and uh some of it will be tran some of
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
it will be immediately obvious
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
you don't need two system offices
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
you don't need two procurement jobs you
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't need two it systems
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
um some of it is going to be um
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
is going to bubble up immediately i i
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
would think don
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
and his counterpart at white mountain
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be working on how they can
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
how they can coordinate their region
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
without any urging from the board
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
some of it is going to take years and
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
may never be worth it
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
for example a single accreditation it
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
may be that
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe in the north country you
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
gradually you gradually create one
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
unified faculty to serve that region
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
but other in other places is the totally
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
different faculty and a totally
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
different accreditation
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
you don't decide that in advance you
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
decide that as you go
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
you begin to understand partially based
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
on the financial pressures
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
what you need what you need to do and
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
how quickly you need to do it people on
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
must be deeply committed to the mission
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
of public higher education for all the
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
because they always have to put that
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
first so what do you do to preserve the
 
02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
first so what do you do to preserve the
mission

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
mission
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
while achieving financial viability and
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then the you know the sequence of
 
02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
and then the you know the sequence of
steps

02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
steps
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh be become apparent as you use those
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
as a guidepost but
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the right board you
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the right chancellor
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
since you don't have time everybody's in
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
real trouble
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
so i think this is the right approach
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
we just have to execute it right and
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat the same point
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
the best thing the legislature could do
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of new hampshire
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
with respect to public higher ed is give
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
this new group
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
a financial cushion rather than put them
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
in a position of having to figure out
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
how they're going to cut four million
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
dollars from
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and we've kind of tabled out what uh
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
what the bill calls for and so
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
the new board wouldn't be seated until
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
like the end of august they've got 60
 
02:04:48.159 --> 02:04:48.790 align:start position:0%
like the end of august they've got 60
days

02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
to to be constituted and then
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
by january 1 they're supposed to have
 
02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.550 align:start position:0%
by january 1 they're supposed to have
delivered

02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
information about what the new
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
um you know what the new entity is and
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
what the new statute
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
looks like if they're going to also
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
undertake a search for a chancellor
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's a year-long process and so as you
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
begin to look at it you've got lots of
 
02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:15.270 align:start position:0%
begin to look at it you've got lots of
things

02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
going on at the same time and we don't
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
have what to me is
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
the absolute first thing which is what
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
is the mission
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
right so we need the mission first
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
we've got this statute that needs to to
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
developed and we've got a chancellor
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
or some sort of chief executive to look
 
02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
or some sort of chief executive to look
for

02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
all in a very very short period of time
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
conceptually the the you know the need
 
02:05:42.719 --> 02:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
conceptually the the you know the need
to

02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's just going to it's going to take
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
time and money
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
there are some initial steps i think
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
some of what don
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
has laid out makes sense i also
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate joe acknowledging the
 
02:06:01.599 --> 02:06:01.990 align:start position:0%
appreciate joe acknowledging the
regional

02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
regional
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
nature of new hampshire and so we may
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know five years down the road get to
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
a new place in fact
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative vlad the community
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
colleges still have not been integrated
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
so they started the work in connecticut
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
they started the work in 2011.
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
their very first attempt at getting
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
initial candidacy from netsch
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
is scheduled for 2023 and they are still
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
a heck of a long way
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
away from uh from that at this moment
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
so there there are partnerships and
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
teams that can be created
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate hearing about plymouth
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
state and i have to say
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's white mountains with an s
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
because of where they are they're in
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
three different locations there
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
um and i and i do agree that the north
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
country needs that
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
western new hampshire needs something
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
too you know we look at the
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
high school graduation rates we look at
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening to students coming out
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the school systems there
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're not matching in many cases the
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
college-going rate of other parts of our
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
state and so
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
again the regional nature and what
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth needs
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
very very different from what newport
 
02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.069 align:start position:0%
very very different from what newport
for

02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
instance needs or the southern uh
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
tier lots of really good questions
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a timeline here but a little
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
bit of planning
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
truly a lot of planning one of the
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
things i said to a previous committee is
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're bringing together two huge
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
entities yet there's nothing in the
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the in hb2 that says let's give them
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
some funding
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
it was a million dollars that was
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
devoted to the reorganization
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
that bea is undertaking for the regional
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
economic development areas 1.4 million
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was spent on dhhs
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
we are the future of our state we are
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to need
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
a financial commitment in order to move
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
sorry

02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're muted representative lad
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead catherine i was just going to
 
02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
go ahead catherine i was just going to
say

02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
so um house bill 2 creates
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
one board to oversee
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
two systems until such time
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
as legislation comes back
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
for deliberation and passage house bill
 
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:34.629 align:start position:0%
for deliberation and passage house bill
2

02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
2
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't in and of itself make
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
one system it ha it creates one board to
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
oversee the
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think the vision of house bill 2 is
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
there will be one integrated system
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
but house bill 2 in and of itself
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's that first step that's right
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
that's right representative milor
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you rick um and thank you
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
for this very sobering
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah analysis i mean i i'm
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
i knew about this but not
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the detail that you provided and i
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
really look very appreciative of this
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether or not there needs
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
to be a single board
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
governing these two systems but what
 
02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
governing these two systems but what
it's

02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
very clear very clear
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
there needs to be somebody that's going
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
to begin to look at what is the mission
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
of higher education in this state
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
and whether it comes up with one board
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
governing all that that may be the
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
result of it
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
but everybody here all the presenters
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
what's the mission of higher education
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
as we deal with the multiple
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
the multiple types of students and david
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
brings up the whole issue of the
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
different types of education the
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
different types of credentialing
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
we're beginning to look at a whole
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
different way
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
of what's needed out there and the
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
bottom line for me
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
is how is it going to impact the
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
workforce in this state and the economy
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
so for me as i look at this and again i
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm still
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
stunned by the information that you've
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
given i'm really very appreciative of
 
02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
given i'm really very appreciative of
that

02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
is that what the board needs to do is
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
not look at how these
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
things are going to be combined
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's even relevant to be
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
combined but the question is
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
is how are we going to meet the needs
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the diverse population here
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
of students and if the result
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
of that review is one board
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
one system so be it
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that is down the road from
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
the initial look
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
of what do we need what is the mit and
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
i'm coming back to the mission again
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
because it is the mission that drives
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
the conversation
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
of where we want to go and that is not
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
that developing of that mission believe
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
me i know
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
because i've done mission statements
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
before is not an easy task
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it does take time and you're right
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to be funded
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
and if if if we think in this state
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this conversation
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
without some kind of funding to help
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
bring in their respective resources we
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
found that
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the study for the commission on
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
student funding
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%

02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
can come in and help us have that
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
conversation that has had these
 
02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
conversation that has had these
experiences

02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%

02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.109 align:start position:0%
now granted those of you that presented
today

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%

02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
from what you bring to the table here
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
but we need to have that conversation in
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
a way that is
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
beyond one system or gnosis multiple
 
02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
beyond one system or gnosis multiple
system

02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out what we want in
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what i'm taking away
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
from this conversation today and i'm so
 
02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:17.910 align:start position:0%
from this conversation today and i'm so
appreciative

02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
appreciative
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the data you shared today it's very
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
sobering thank you
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative joe is that your hand up
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i i um
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
i violently agree with what you're
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
saying representative miller
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is no tomorrow if we don't start
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
taking nobody wants to say this i'm just
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to say it i don't i don't have a
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
dog in this hunt i don't have an
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not an alumnus i don't have a member
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
of the family who's an alumnus of any of
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the institutions
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
these institutions are going to start to
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
fail financially unless
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature is willing to put
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of more dollars in
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're on the cusp of several failures
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
and so it is it is
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
our duty collectively as citizens of the
 
02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
our duty collectively as citizens of the
state

02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
to preserve the financial well-being of
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
public higher education
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we got too much cost
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
spread out over too many institutions
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
so unless we're willing to say create a
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
board you have faith in
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
to manage through the financial crisis
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
and while you're doing that
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
then take on the very worthy
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you're you're raising and
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to need outside help
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh and but you've got to buy
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
it from breathing space
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
i mean you need to put the fire out in
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
kitchen

02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know if we had listened to ross in
 
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
you know if we had listened to ross in
2018

02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
would be able to have the conversation
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting we have
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
before we move to something else we
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
didn't well some of
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i some some did joe and i can
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
remember sean jasper
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
yelling the same thing um and
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
um and ross was very active in trying to
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
make us aware of what was what we were
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
headed into
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
and yes we're there now and yeah i don't
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
that 25 that's going to be eliminated
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
occurring here in this state so what we
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
need to do is we need to move forward
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i hear that from everybody that's
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
spoken today
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
that we we don't have any time
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%

hungry there
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%

uh to spend more time than just the the
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
morning shot here

02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
happen mel
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you yeah because this is
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
definitely happened
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
this is a huge topic and there's so many
 
02:17:37.679 --> 02:17:38.790 align:start position:0%
this is a huge topic and there's so many
issues

02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh from the governance side right down
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
through all the policy considerations
 
02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:43.270 align:start position:0%
through all the policy considerations
and

02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's huge and it's hard to believe
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we have to try to get that done
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
within a week and a half here
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
exactly so so given given that rick is
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
um is is jen helping us out with
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
um putting together draft findings and
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
stuff like that
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
well she's uh she's agreed to work with
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
us and support us in any way that we
 
02:18:04.719 --> 02:18:05.589 align:start position:0%
us and support us in any way that we
need
