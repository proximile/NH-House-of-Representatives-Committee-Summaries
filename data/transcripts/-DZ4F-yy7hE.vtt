introduce to this committee house bill
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
17133 which would allow um would make it
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
a fense for a person charged with a
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
class a felony or greater to uh fail to

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
process Mr chairman I retired from the
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
US Department of
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
Justice and under rule 42 of the federal
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
rules of criminal procedure the rule is
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
that anyone charged with a felony in the
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
federal court court system must appear
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
at all aspects of the criminal justice
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
process uh from the initial appearance
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
arraignment jury selection trial and if
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
found guilty be there for sentencing as
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
well that's for all
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
felonies what this bill would do would
 
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
limit it to a class A or greater felony
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
um the rule I just mentioned I thought
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would have a
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
similar rule or a similar law to what
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
the federal government had and it wasn't
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
until last month that I realized that I
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
was mistaken about that on December 7th
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
2019 5-year-old Hony mcgomery was
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
brutally beaten to death and after an
 
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.790 align:start position:0%
brutally beaten to death and after an
extensive

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
investigation her father was charged
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
murder his trial lasted 12 12 days and
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
for most of those 12 days of jury trial
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
Adam mcgomery decided he didn't want to
 
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
Adam mcgomery decided he didn't want to
be

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
there the jury finally came in with a
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
verdict they some of the counts they
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
found him guilty of were a second
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
deegree murder second degree
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
assault falsification of
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
evidence and abuse of a
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
corpse even when the jury came in with
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
their verdict again Adam mcgomery
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
decided not to be
 
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
there the judge sent his set the
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
sentencing date for Adam mcgomery for
 
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.550 align:start position:0%
sentencing date for Adam mcgomery for
May

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
9th and it's my understanding that uh
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
Adam mcgomery has already indicated he
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
did not plan to be there for the
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
sentencing as
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
well and the County prosecutor has
 
00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.070 align:start position:0%
well and the County prosecutor has
already

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
filed uh a petition with the court
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
asking that they the court issue an
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
order mandating that he'd be present for
 
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.950 align:start position:0%
order mandating that he'd be present for
the

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
sentencing um as they said earlier what
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
this bill would do anybody charged with
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
a class a felony which is a felony as
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
most of you know with a period of
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
imprisonment from 7 and a half to 15
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
years or any crime with a greater period
 
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.830 align:start position:0%
years or any crime with a greater period
of

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
incarceration and that would include
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
murder fonal sexual assault uh arm
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
offenses

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to close there but just add
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
one more thing Mr
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
chairman when the prosecutor filed his
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
motion with the trial judge asking for
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
that order to have Adam Montgomery in
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
court he said in his Motion in
 
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
court he said in his Motion in
paraphrase

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
paraphrase
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
that how many
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
Montgomery's family and loved ones will
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
be in court that day Adam Montgomery
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
should be there as well to hear from the
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
court directly what his senters will be
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
and when I hear that phrase how many
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
Montgomery's loved ones I feel that that
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
includes all of us too the citizens of
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'd be glad to answer
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Speaker questions
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I very much
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate and support the intent of the
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
bill I I wonder about for example in a
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
case as you mentioned of fonia sexual
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
assault for a victim who's
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
testifying um having to have their
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
alleged as salent staring at them while
 
00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:02.190 align:start position:0%
alleged as salent staring at them while
they

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
testify whether there might be like I'm
 
00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
just trying to think of the it might be
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
more uncomfortable to testify with their
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
alleged as salent staring at them and
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how how to balance
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
that with the need to make sure the
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
person is present and I know I'm not
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
phrasing that well but I hope you
 
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
understand no I know exactly what you're
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
saying um although under article six of
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution every accused person
 
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
has a right to face your
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
accuser I don't know if a motion be
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
could be filed with the court by the
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor maybe having them uh testify
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
by close circuit television from an
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
adjourning room or to make some
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation to make it easier for the
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
victim especially if the victim is a
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
minor I think it would be even more
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
traumatizing to that person but I'm sure
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
this has come up before in the court I
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
and again the defense could argue the
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
article six but I think accommodations
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
made thank you for that question just to
 
00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:07.959 align:start position:0%
answer you quick accommodations are made
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
especially where a defendant is uh
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
disruptive or threatening staring doing
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
something to the to the victim the
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
courts do make accommodations as all the
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
way from removing them to having them
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
sit somewhere else um they're very
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
creative when they need to be further
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
Newman I have just two questions and
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
they're just mainly about the process so
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
I understand what the process is and on
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh page one line
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
nine um it says but upon the motion of
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
the defendant the court may excuse the
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
presence of the defendant require by
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph one for good cause and I'm
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
just wondering does the judge make the
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
decision then does that what they mean
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
good cause how does that work exactly I
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
could see a person out on bail uh for um
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
a class a
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
felony and having a sickness in the
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
family having a dying relative or
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
something really catastro catastrophic
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
happening in their life where the
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
defense attorney would want to make a
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
motion to the trial judge asking that
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
they allow the defendant to be excused
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
for whatever just that's why I put in
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
the words just cause whether it be a
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
funeral or whatever it might be that
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
allowed follow up
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
and the followup is on page um I guess
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's to the last page um and it says the
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
term imprisonment pursuant to this
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
section shall be consecutive to the
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
sentence of imprisonment for any other
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
offense so my understanding of that
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
would be that he would have reached all
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the requirements for the
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
offense and then if he had not shown up
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
sometime previously and there was a
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
consequence to that that consequence
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be cons executive to the to that
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
previous term of imprisonment and would
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
follow on after that exactly for examp
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
for example uh uh someone out on bail
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
for um a class eight felony a serious
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
felony in jumps bail and takes off which
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
has happened before if they do that and
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
they're found guilty on their underlying
 
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
they're found guilty on their underlying
offense

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
the in would be an additional sentence
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
on top on and after the original
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
sentence could I ask one more followup
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay but this in in this section this
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
section specifically has penalties when
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
the a person does refuses to to show up
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
for court even though they're ordered to
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and all of that I believe there are
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
penalties for that because it says
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this section shall be
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
conservative and that wouldn't be
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
jumping bail that would be
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
he would finish up everything and then
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
there would be if he didn't hadn't shown
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
up it would be after that is that is
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
that right or well what it is is if a
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
person is uh scheduled to be in court
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
and would be released on
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
bail um I know in the federal court is
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
failure to appear is what the offense is
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
um if they do not come to their trial uh
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually once the trial begins and a
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
person should jump bail the trial could
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
go on an Absentia uh without them being
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
present because they voluntarily
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
absented themselves from The Trial
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
process they would finish with the court
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and there'd be a ruling and if they're
 
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.269 align:start position:0%
and there'd be a ruling and if they're
found

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
be not captured or not found for years
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
after when they said after they finished
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
their original sentence for what they
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
were charged there'd be the additional
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
penalty which could be up to the maximum
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
under article
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
under um a class a felony thank you but
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that again would be discretionary with
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
the court thank you representative
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question um
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
is it the case currently that the court
 
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.949 align:start position:0%
is it the case currently that the court
um

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
can uh or rather that the um
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
prosecution can request that the court
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm back here so I can look at me
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
um I look through the um New Hampshire
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
rules of uh criminal proceedings and I
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
look through New Hampshire state law and
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
our house council did as well and
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's really no requirement for a
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
person to be at their own trial I was
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
talking to our Mar County Sheriff the
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
other day and he told me the same thing
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
often a deputy will go to pick up
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
somebody in the county jail and the
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
person will say no I I don't want to go
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
it follow
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
up but um thanks for taking my followup
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
um but is it currently possible within
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
the rules in the court system in New
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the prosecution to motion
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
to compel the presence of the defendant
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
no there's no rule of law that says that
 
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
uh a judge can mandate that a person be
 
00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
uh a judge can mandate that a person be
in

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
court I suppose they could issue a
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
subpoena for them or if it was a
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
question of
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
identification um under those
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I'm sure that'd be a
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
motion by the prosecution and the judge
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
could grant that motion and have the
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
prison but to say I just want to have
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
him in court without any particular
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
reason then no but for in the instant
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
case though in the Montgomery case the
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
prosecution has filed a motion to compel
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
him to appear do you know under what
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
grounds they've they're using to file
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
that motion no I just know that what I I
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
read it briefly online some time ago and
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
I the the prosecutor had just said that
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
they felt it was in the best interest of
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the family and loved ones that they be
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
in court to hear the impact statements
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
and everything else and not be excused
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
so and that's a kind of a good example
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
to your uh question to uh the fact that
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor has to file a motion to
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
get Adam Montgomery in court for his own
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
sentencing and now it's up to the judge
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
determination so just to be clear a
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutor can file a motion for
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything but there's no law that would
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
compel the judge to to actually do it so
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's the answer to that um
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.629 align:start position:0%
I think that's the answer to that um
representative

00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
St thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
question uh I think you've actually
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
partially answered it that this impact
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
would uh allow if passed the victim to
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
face the victim's family the accused and
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the impact statements be read and
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
they be uh basically held accountable in
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
public in person versus taking a
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
cowardly way out by avoiding to go to
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
their trial when faced with heinous
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
crimes exactly in in the case we're
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
talking about with Adam mcgomery if the
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
judge should deny the prosecutor's
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
motion to have him compelled to be there
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
a victim impact statement would be read
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
but it' be read to an empty chair at the
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
defense table thank you thank you for
 
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
defense table thank you thank you for
your

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
M thank you for taking my
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
question on uh on line 23 uh of the bill
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh it says a person is guilty of a class
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
a felony if having been charged or
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
awaiting sentence for an offense
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
punishable by life uh life imprisonment
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
or imprisonment of a maximum term of 15
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
years or more um the the language in the
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill um uh having been charged or
 
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
bill um uh having been charged or
awaiting

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
awaiting
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
sentencing seems to open the door to the
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that someone could actually
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
be found not guilty of the crime um but
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
still would be charged with an offense
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
if they if they didn't appear for some
 
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
if they if they didn't appear for some
reason

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess my question to you is is
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
does that concern you and is it
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
something that you think we need to
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
address in the bill
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
um it's something you may want to look
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
at but it actually it doesn't concern me
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
um it quite simply says that if you're
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
charged with a class a felony you must
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
make all Court appearances and that's
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
why I put the provision in the bill if a
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
defendants attorney makes a motion to
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
the court uh saying I'd like to have my
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
client excused from this court hearing
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
and these this is the good reason I have
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
for doing it um then the court would
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
grant that motion and and everything
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
would be fine normally if somebody does
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
not show up at a court hearing they
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
normally have taken off um there's
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
always extenda circumstances that
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
somebody could argue but if it was
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
simply they did not want to face their
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
accusers they did not want to have their
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
day in court then that's a separate
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
matter but but there is a mechanism to
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
excuse that person from court if they
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
wish to absent
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
themselves but thank you for that
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm curious and we
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
might have somebody who's coming to
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
speak from um the uh judicial Department
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
I know that it says that they were
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
consulted um in the writing of this bill
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if there is the
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
process of petitioning the court to have
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
them compelled to appear do you know uh
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
what what what are the metrics by which
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
that decision is
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
made well and this that's a good
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
question I thank you for it under the
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
current circumstances with Adam
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Montgomery um the prosecutor has taken
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
has done the only thing that he can do
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
and that is to petition the judge uh
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
asking him to compel now the convicted
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
um person to appear for their
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
sentencing um that is the only mechanism
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
available um is to ask the court to
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
mandate and the judge may very well
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
order that person to appear in
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
sentencing but then again they've got to
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
base it on uh law and um you know and um
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
president of the court and I don't know
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
what grounds the judge could give for
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
saying yeah they need to be there other
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
than humanitarian reasons I think we all
 
00:20:57.919 --> 00:21:02.070 align:start position:0%
than humanitarian reasons I think we all
see

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
Balden um thanks for taking another
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
question for me um it seems
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
like it wasn't helpful in the case
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
they've been referencing that the
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
defendant wasn't present that it wasn't
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
helpful to the defendant's case and I
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
wonder have you um have any thoughts as
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
to the pros and cons
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
of essentially legally permitting
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
someone to hamstring
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
themselves versus requiring them to
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
appear and potentially
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
losing the impact of their
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
absence um it's my understanding in this
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
trial that the judge uh in his charge to
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
the jury told the jury please take no
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
inference in the fact that the defendant
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
has not been present um and again I I
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
refer to that one part of the bill that
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
does allow defense attorney to file a
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
motion with the court and they may not
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
want their CLI and and I suppose the
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
defense attorney quit argue in that
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
motion I feel it would
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
unduly influence the jury to have my
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
client present and they Court May grant
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
that motion but then again it'd be up to
 
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.230 align:start position:0%
that motion but then again it'd be up to
the

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
court I think we have to be careful not
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
to confuse the the person's Fifth
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment right not to incriminate
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
themselves in other words not take the
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
stand versus the mere fact of them being
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
present in the room um for the for the
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
purposes of having to face their alleged
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
victim versus taking an inference from
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
and not testifying it's it's a different
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
but close situation further questions I
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
would just add to that Mr chairman
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point uh you know I
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
spent almost 30 years in the federal
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
court system and I can't recall any time
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
an attorney didn't want their client to
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
be present with them in court and of
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
course they're not just dressed in their
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
orange jumpsuits they have them in
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
civilian clothes uh the jury never sees
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
them in handcuffs or any other
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
restraints so U not Prejudice that
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
shy absolutely
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
see no further questions uh thank you
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
for intr thank the committee speaker
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%

I am opening the executive session on
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
1713 FN and I am recognizing myself to
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
make a motion and I move ought to pass
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
may I have a second I'll second
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
that representative G yes representative
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
gath is going to Second thank you though
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh secondly by representative Gite I
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
will speak to my
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
motion um as we've all aware of the the
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
the case that spurred this
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
bill um it it's horrific and for that
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
family to not be able to face the person
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
who did this is I think a
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
revictimization of them twice over
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
having said that we don't legislate
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
based on one
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
case but what one case can do is
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
illuminate for us an existing problem
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have I would say
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
conflicting laws on one hand we passed a
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
law that says victims can have a victim
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
Witness impact statement where they can
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
tell the court the damage the
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
perpetrator did to them and also many
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
times the letter is to the perpetrator
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
saying this is what you did to me and my
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
family and I hope you don't forget
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
that at the same time letting the
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
defendant basically say I don't care and
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
not show up really makes the first one
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
worthless what good is telling uh or
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
writing an impact statement to to a
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
perpetrator if he doesn't have to hear
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
it so based on that I think that it is
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
imperative that we make sure that people
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
that commit these crimes face up to what
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
they have done and not only for
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and the victims but for the
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
public at large to see that Justice
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a penalty for for
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
breaking the law and you will have to
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
face it also I would point out that
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
there are safety valves built into this
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
legislation where a judge will have
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
discretion in certain circumstances to
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
say this person doesn't have to be here
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
for various
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
reasons the prosecutor can even use that
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
to say we don't want this person here
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
for various reasons be intimidation of
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
witnesses or the jury or what have you
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
so there are mechanisms in this
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
law as I said that are safety
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
vals so I would urge you to support this
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
and vote ought to pass representative
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
here gather would you like to speak to
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
your second yes um I truly believe this
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
is a good bill and and um but I did have
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a concern um that a person
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
would be punished
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
um even though they weren't found guilty
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
yet so I think for me I like the idea
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
more so that the person has to be there
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
for sentencing but I'm going to vote for
 
00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:00.510 align:start position:0%
for sentencing but I'm going to vote for
this

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
bill um because I believe that it's at
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
least trending in the
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
correct way for um someone that refuses
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
appearance thank you further discussion
 
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.550 align:start position:0%
appearance thank you further discussion
representative

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
seig thank you um uh like representative
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
har GTH I to like the intent of the bill
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
I understand it it makes sense to me but
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
I have concerns also that it has to be a
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
a consecutive sentencing and that it
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't give the judge leeway or
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility I feel like our judicial
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
system is designed to allow our judges
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
to use their best discretion in
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
sentencing and and that's an aspect that
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me so I'll be voting in support
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I am hoping that there
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
will be a essentially a floor amendment
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
to address that and perhaps also maybe
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
make it that they have to be there for
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
victim statements and sentencing but not
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily mandated for the rest of it
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
if that's truly their
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
choice thank you um representative Stone
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I think this
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
bill is a necessary tool that the judges
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
can employ if it passes into law in
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
addition I think we have a history in
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
this country of having public trials for
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
a reason and that includes having the
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
defendant and victims both at the trial
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
to be heard in public uh we don't really
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
have closed criminal proceedings
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
therefore I think it's more appropriate
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
to have a defendant at a trial
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
especially to hear the impact on the
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
victim's family or from the victims
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
themselves I think a lot of times in
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
this committee we seem to focus more on
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
the defendants and not enough on the
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
victims in the impact that they have or
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
their families if they are no longer to
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability to hear it for
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you I just wanted to
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
add something um in in response to what
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative said
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh made she made a good point with
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
regard to discretion for the judge and I
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
would point out that this Still Remains
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
um there there's not a a a minimum
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence applied to this um so
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
if a judge were or a jury were to find
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
someone guilty of this secondary offense
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
they could sentence them to one day on
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
and after um they could stay um a a
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
sentence they could suspend a sentence
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
there there's no minimum mandatory it
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
just says consecutive so whatever they
 
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.630 align:start position:0%
just says consecutive so whatever they
get

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
has to be after this but it doesn't say
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have to sentence them to a certain
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
amount of time or a certain punishment
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
so they still have a lot of discretion
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
um representative new thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting in in support of
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
this bill um and I just wanted to you
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
know I I've uh been an activist and an
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
advocate for quite a while and one thing
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that we say is that stories are um
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
the most important thing you share your
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
story it connects with people on a human
 
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.030 align:start position:0%
story it connects with people on a human
level

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so the most important thing for me
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
about this bill is for people to be able
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
to um to connect beyond what the
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and Punishment
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
can do but be able to connect with um
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
with the perpetrator and uh and
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully get to a point of um healing
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh make a a a really true
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
impression um with the person who's
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
committed these crimes and and I that's
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
my hope thank you thank you in in
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
response to that I would say how many
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
times have we seen to the shock of us
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
all where the victim has said to the
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
defendant's face I forgive you and that
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
is part of their healing process to be
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%

Muse I I do wish that uh we would have
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to hear uh
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
um other folks with more knowledge of
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
our of our legal system weigh in as we
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
usually do on bills like this and I
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
understand that we're under a a very
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
very tight time frame um I intend to
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
support the bill uh I also intend to go
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
out and ask some of those folks uh what
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
they think about this bill um if they
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
think there are things that we may want
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
to adjust uh and if we do find things
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
like that um we will uh address them in
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
chair um I disagree with the that there
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
is not a mandatory minimum here and the
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is that if you look at
 
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.270 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is that if you look at
line

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
23 it says a person is guilty of a class
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
a felony if have having been charged or
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
awaiting a sentence of for an offense
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
punishable by life imprisonment or
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
imprisonment of a maximum term 15 years
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
or more the p and the person person
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
knowingly fails to appear or refuses to
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
comply with the transport order that
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
they are guilty of um let's see where I
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
can find
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
that they're guilty of a class a felony
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to what I brought up
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
earlier which is p line three on the
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
next page that says the term of
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
imprisonment imposed by pursuant to this
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
section and the term of imprisonment is
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
whatever I just described it shall be
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
consecutive it doesn't say it can be
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
reduced it doesn't say anything like
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
that so you can you have you could end
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
up with two consecutive 15-year
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
sentences and the second one in my
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
opinion is a defao mandatory sentence so
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
I that is a big problem for me with this
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
bill I think that language should be
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
changed but I am going to support the
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill and um just put that out there so
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
that it can be dealt with
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
wherever and I I appreciate you um being
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
willing to do that and I would encourage
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
you to talk to um someone from the court
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
or an attorney um because I'm fairly
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
confident that it's not a minimum
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory the the consecutive is
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory but what you get sentenced is
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
not mandatory because you are found
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
guilty of a class a felony the judge
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
still has discretion as to what he
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
sentences you to for that class a felony
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
there is a sentence um up to you can be
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
sentenced to but whatever he sentences
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
you to he could suspend it he could do
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things but if you are
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
sentenced to incarceration it would be
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
on and after that portion is mandatory
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
but the amount is not um but we can work
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
that out and I appreciate your support
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the bill this morning further
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%

same access that local County and state
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%

enforcement agencies the range of
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
respons has varied widely from a full
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
release of an investigative case File to
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
denial because the law enforcement
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
agency treats the request as a right to
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
no request under the latter no New

information would be released unless
 
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.190 align:start position:0%
information would be released unless
unless

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
authorized uh is authorization is
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
obtained by both the alleged offender
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
victim the proposed legislation would
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
enable the New Hampshire National Guard
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
to take appropriate security measures
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
and when appropriate take necessary
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
administrative actions against soldiers
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
and employees based upon the information
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
collected through Criminal
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
investigations this is something that is
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
quite frankly very very important many
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the National Guard members as well as
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the civilian employees have security
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
clearances and they hand they they
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
handle um High CL highly classified
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
documents and if a National Guard member
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
or employee has come into contact with
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of Civilian legal authorities
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
that could affect their security
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
clearance and whether or not it would
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
get revoked or amended um but right now
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability because they
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
can't uniformly get those
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
records because the potential actions
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
that may be taken are not judicial in
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
nature the due process rights within the
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire criminal justice system of
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the National Guard employees and service
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
members would not be affected by this
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um I'm not sure if any you
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
know but I teach um at the N Community
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
College in nashwa and when I teach a
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
section on our Judicial
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
System often say we have three Judicial
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
Systems we have the federal we have the
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
state and then we have one that we
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
voluntarily submit ourselves to and that
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
is the military um it's very very
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
different than a civilian um system of
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
justice and many people don't realize
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
that um um the proposed legislation um
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
does not provide access to the police
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
records um of a New Hampshire citizen
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
who is not a New Hampshire National
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
Guard employee or service member um at
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
this point Mr chairman um I will
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony the uh the
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
Commanding General of the National Guard
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Senator um we will reserve the

questions for the thing thank you for

01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
consideration uh the chair calls um
 
01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:46.630 align:start position:0%
consideration uh the chair calls um
General

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
melittis good morning Mr chair committee
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
members for the record a Major General
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
David meletus the agent general for the
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard with me
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
here today is Captain Ryan Alis a
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
military attorney a former County
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so it's just simple um we are
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
a standards based organization this is
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
about good order and discipline if
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate uh if if inappropriate
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
actions occur in the outside in the
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
private private sector we don't have
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
positive authority to coordinate with
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
civilian law enforcement agencies to
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
find out what our service members may
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
done um based upon the Privacy Act and
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
some other and so no law enforcement
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
agency is the same within the state they
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
have different jurisdictions so the
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
challenge we have is if inappropriate
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh we may or may not find about it or we
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
don't have access to those records so
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
the senator alluded to the fact that
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
security clearances that's one same
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
thing as domestic violence if a service
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
member's commiss domestic violence um is
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
convicted of it um that infects their
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
employment they can't carry a firearm
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
they are non- Deployable and we kick
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
them out of the service so having access
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
to criminal records allows us to instill
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
is a standards based organization good
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
order and discipline no more no less and
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions like I said I
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
have a military attorney here who can
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
ask you uh answer any questions you may
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
have thank you thank you General um my
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
first question would be does does the
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
CID currently not have access to if they
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
open a criminal investigation on the
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
records uh this is Captain Alis uh c
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
will conduct investigations for active
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
duty soldiers uh who are under title 10
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
but most National Guard soldiers are
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
under title 32 status and when they're
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
on state active duty they're under Title
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
5 status uh so CID will not investigate
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore we don't have access to
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
C's um access to military records okay I
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
see so the National Guard doesn't have
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
the same uh an agency equivalent to the
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
CID to be able to carry out those
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations without being
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
able to get these records correct yes
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Captain um further
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions um representative n thank you
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
question um I think you know it's it
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
sounds like a a good bill my question is
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
um do you think that this is limited
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
enough in scope to people within the
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
National Guard Etc who would need to
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
have this information for the purpose of
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
of carrying out this or it doesn't leave
 
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
it open to um being open to anyone in
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
the in the National
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
Guard so the the bill only provides
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
access to military attorneys judge
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh so uh it is limited to
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
attorneys who would be advising commands
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
as to how to uh enforce good order and
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
discipline it doesn't provide access to
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh commanders uh ncos or anyone else to
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
request and get uh criminal histories or
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
criminal reports and ma'am to give a
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
context you have about 3,000 Uniform
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
service members we probably have about
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
15 18 milli attorneys okay thank
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
you uh captain could you please just for
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the committee if you
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
could and I know this is a big ask in
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
like a minute explain how the Judge
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
Advocate General Corp is both the
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and a defense um because it
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
can get confusing in other words in your
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial role you might pull these
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
records and the guy who prosecuted
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday might be assigned to defend
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
that same Soldier the next day could you
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
explain that for us a little bit uh that
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
used to be the case sir however uh
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's no longer the case uh judge
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
Advocates are either assigned to a
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
commander uh and such as myself I'm a
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
brigade Judge Advocate and I have
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
another Captain who is a military
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
Justice adviser we ADI advise a 06
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
Colonel on Military Justice and all
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
operations however in within our state
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Army National Guard
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
we have a O2 first lieutenant Lieutenant
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
Aria who is a trial defense service his
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
Judge Advocate his sole role is to
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
defend soldiers within the state of New
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and his chain of command Falls
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
outside of the State of New Hampshire so
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
his rating chain goes to a uh person in
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to another person in
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania up to someone at NGB I
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
previously held that role uh for a
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
number of years uh and it ensures that
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
soldiers are not uh uh under the
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
influence of command within the state
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
and can do the uh best job to zealously
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for that Soldier the Air Force
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
has the same type of thing I believe
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's called area defense Council well
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see things have changed for
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the better in 30 years um any further
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions regarding this representa Muse
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question my
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
assumption is there would need to be
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
some violation of military Justice in
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
order to precipitate this type of
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
Records request or does it work the
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
other way would you actually want do you
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
I guess do you envision this uh also
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
working perhaps as a notification system
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
that would that would uh uh essentially
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
allow you to be notified um if if a
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
soldier was found guilty of something
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
like a domestic violence charge I'm I'm
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
a little curious just exactly how you
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
envision the statute
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
working sir I don't think the statute is
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
written to be a notification system I
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
don't think that it creates any burden
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement to actually inform
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard that
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
there uh has been a conviction or any uh
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
interaction with uh law enforcement
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
however it does enable us to get police
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
reports uh the intent is for us to upon
 
01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:45.799 align:start position:0%
finding out that a soldier has been
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
involved with law enforcement to reach
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
out to law enforcement and get the
 
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
police reports uh and take action in
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
that regard uh generally when uh
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
soldiers have been involved uh with law
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement it creates either a security
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
issue uh that we need to review or
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
creates as you said uh a potential
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
violation of the uniform code of
 
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.149 align:start position:0%
violation of the uniform code of
military

01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
followup

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
so the way that I I read the statute and
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
and please excuse me I'm I'm just I've
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
read it about two or three times but the
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
way that I've read it
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
um is that uh it not only would allow
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
you to request records for an individual
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
Soldier but it almost looks like the way
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's written you could actually request
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
the records of all your
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
soldiers um is that part of the
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
intention behind this no it's not sir
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's the first one right it's it's
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
a function of um uh if there's a
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence issue right um
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
generally speaking on minor mem meters
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
solders self-report they'll tell their
 
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
chain to come in I got get a speeding
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
ticket or I DUI and then but sometimes
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
when there's inappropriate behavior we
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
may not be notified so then for us it's
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to search for the
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
information to ensure that Hey listen
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
did that really happen and that's when
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes our privacy act like the
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
civilian law enforcement may not share
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
with you so it's the same thing domestic
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault it's we just
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get aware of that specific
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
issue for that specific Soldier and like
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
Captain ol alluded to is they're
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
assigned a milit attorney Judge Advocate
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
in their defense um when we take the
 
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.149 align:start position:0%
in their defense um when we take the
disciplinary

01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
you with regard to security
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
clearances not knowing about a soldier's
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
um potential civilian um problems could
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
that make them open to possible
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
blackmail because someone could threaten
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
to out them to their command if they
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
didn't re certain information or things
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
like that could you touch on why it's
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
important that there's full transparency
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
clearance that's probably you
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
sir no no so uh I would say this um you
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
know we have several positions or job
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
categories that require different
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
security clearances right there's a
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
standard secret clearance there's top
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
secret and there's other sort of caveats
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
associated with that right so for
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
example all our military police um and
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
security forces both in New Hampshire
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
Army and a National Guard require
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
security clearance so you are correct
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
that if inappropriate behavior occurs
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
and we do not know about it to revoke
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
that security clearance is actually
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a big deal and there was an
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunate issue in Massachusetts
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
recently uh that sort of brought to
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
light um some of the issues with
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
security clearance and who has access to
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
what type of material so yes it is a big
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
deal thank you I guess what I was trying
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
to point out is if someone held a highly
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
classified security clearance and had
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
certain information
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
and the command wasn't aware of what
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
they were involved in in the civilian
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement someone seeking to get
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
information from them could say unless
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
you want your command to find out about
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
this you better do what we say it makes
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
them susceptible to to um to losing
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
their clearance because of that any
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
further questions I think everyone
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
understands how important this is um
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh did somebody
 
01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
else did you have one oh okay thank you
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
um General and Captain for coming today
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
and I think we have a pretty good grasp
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
for us thank you very much thank you sir
 
01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
for us thank you very much thank you sir
thank

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
Grady thank you Mr chairman ladies and
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee for the
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is Kevin Grady I'm a 25y
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
year Air Force veteran and I'm a 25y
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
year resident of the town of hookit New
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today I'm here representing
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 20 member organizations of the state
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
veterans ADV advisory committee and we
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
are uh chared by state law 115 colon
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
a-8 to speak for the veteran Community
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire and one of the
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
things we do is we look at bills that
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
have veteran impact we take a position
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
on them then I come and tell you what
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
that position is we do wholeheartedly
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
support this bill we think that that
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
where possible uh civilian law
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement and military law enforcement
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
should work hand inand to the best that
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
they can and and I want to share a story
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
that that from my career on active duty
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
that might put some of this a little bit
 
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
into perspective for you uh in the mid
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
90s I was a flying squadron commander
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
down in Panama City Florida and one day
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
I get this phone call from this man who
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
says I'm with the National Security
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
Agency and I think that you should
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
revoke Sergeant so and so security
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
clearance for that possession of
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana conviction he had three months
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
ago up in Alabama and I went excuse me
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
what uh so I had no clue whatsoever that
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
that any of this had happened um as far
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
as security clearance items go this man
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
had a security clearance because most
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
people in the Air Force do have a
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
security clearance but but he held held
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
a job that uh he was packing my
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
parachute he was in my life support shop
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I want that person you know
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
and then when I got into the background
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the arrest thing they there was a
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
traffic pullover they were literally
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
smoking it in the car while they were
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
driving and and so that's bad uh so have
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
this knowledge is is where we can work
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
together is is a good thing and I've
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
also seen it in my career where you know
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
the the the local the in the
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
relationship is so good that the
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
military and the civilian uh folks get
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
together and say do you want to talk do
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
you want to do this or do you want us to
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
do it and then they they sort of pass it
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
off and say yeah we'll let we'll go
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and let you do it and just because
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
somebody has tried in the civilian world
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
for a a crime doesn't mean that
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
non-judicial I can't do things like give
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
them letters of reprimand or take
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
Stripes away from them or take pay away
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
from them those kinds of things on a
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
non-judicial basis that's really all I
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell you we do support this
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill and we we hope that you'll you'll
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
along thank you any
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions just to touch on that it's I
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
think that if anyone ever watches like
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
NCIS um do not believe that that's not
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
how that works military uh police are
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
not out there um investigating crimes in
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
the civili world um no they're not no
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you for your
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
sir uh the chair calls um Victor Muzzy
 
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire State
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
Police Captain Victor muzy I always
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
forget your rank thank you Mr chairman
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I just wanted
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
to speak very briefly after speaking to
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
the good Captain here behind me about
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill uh originally our
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I think kind of addressed
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with uh our state
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction record and also um
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
the FBI record and as I understand it
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's really not about necessarily the
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
criminal record it's more about police
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
reports if you will and court records or
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
documents and things like that and from
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
the from the law en enforcement aspect I
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
can understand some of the apprehension
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
that maybe some departments have had
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
relative to releasing these records um
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
like if it's not an arrest report or an
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
arrest record but rather an
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
investigation report there might be some
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
apprehension there given um the
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
defendant's position you know are we
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to get sued if we release this
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
report who we releasing it to you know
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
for what purpose what does it get used
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
for so I think this bill will clarify
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
that and allow uh some protections I
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
think to the agencies where these
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
gentlemen may be looking for reports
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
legitimately so and it's this is really
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
a matter of public safety um and um
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
public service and and it certainly
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me that these things be
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
available consistently for these these
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
folks to do their jobs for the reasons
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
stated and so I just kind of wanted to
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
correct I guess the fiscal note from
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
from our perspective as the good Captain
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
tells me it's it's not about paying the
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
$25 to the Department of Safety um it
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's more or less just having consistent
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
access to these things and so um for
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
those reasons you know I think I think
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
we would support the bill or the idea
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
behind it and make sense that um there's
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
equal access to these things for this
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
limited purpose uh and I appreciate the
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions about whether this would open
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
up other people to getting a hold of it
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
and I like the idea that no it it's
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for these judge advocates
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
in that process and um I think that's
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
all I have so I'm I'm happy to take any
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions to the best of your knowledge
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill that
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
exempts them from the unlawful
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
distribution of criminal offender record
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
information is there they would still be
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
held to the same standards as a New
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement officer would
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
correct that that's my understanding of
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
me yeah it just allows them what I would
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
consider consistent access in the brief
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
conversation we had it sounds like one
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
agency may be full willing to give them
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
everything another agency makes them
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
jump through a bunch of Hoops to get
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
what I would call or consider basic sort
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
of Records to have an understanding of
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
what occurred so I think it I think the
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
same standard would apply relative to
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
the the federal record and the state
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
record and the Privacy um inherent
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
privacy protections that are that are
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
there for
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
those um one more question and I'm not
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
sure if it should go to you or the other
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
Captain do you currently have uh the
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
ability to access Federal triple I
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
records or do you not have that ability
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
without going through a a New Hampshire
 
01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:19.550 align:start position:0%
without going through a a New Hampshire
law

01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement we tried to briefly discuss
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not I'm not sure so we
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what the what the the answer
 
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
don't know what the what the the answer
is

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
but uh to be frank sir I I don't know uh
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
if we had any difficulty going uh in
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
getting those records through uh New
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh law enforcement we would
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
contact federal law enforcement and
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
we've never had any problem getting any
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
records through federal law enforcement
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that this
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
encompassed enough because of the fact
 
01:19:50.629 --> 01:19:50.639 align:start position:0%
that we are surrounded by several states
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
where your soldiers could go and get in
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
trouble if you couldn't get that record
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire law enforcement and
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
Maine said no or Vermont said no you'll
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
be back to square one again so I want to
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that our people are covered so
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay if if you can get it from the FBI
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine yeah that's what I was going
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
to say chairman I just think you know
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
from our perspective if they have
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
another another Avenue to get it that
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve safety y um if if the
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
expectation were that we were going to
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
disseminate it that would be probably
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
another conversation and maybe some
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
cleanup language if you will and either
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
this you know RSA or another one just to
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that that we were authorized to
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
do that for that purpose I mean in my
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
mind the these these gentlemen are law
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement as much as I am or public
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
servants as much as I am and so I just
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
would want to clarify um if if there
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
were an alternate path that that was an
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay practice you know but it sounds
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
like they have alternate means to be
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
able to obtain that so that's good good
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
excellent all right see you no further
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you for your
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%

Vocational uh Planning Group um I will
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
just briefly say about the uh bill
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
before we turn to at a moment that
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see that establish uh correction
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
education vational Planning Group
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
certain folks on it and um then a set of
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
Duties which I will discuss a little
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
more detail later but I'd like to
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
provide first a little context about um
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
why this bill came forward and why this
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be a very useful tool for
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections to move
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
forward on education programs um I have
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
a handout that is uh going around um
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill arises out of the fact that
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
the um Federal legislation has
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
reestablished the uh pel program for
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people it's a second chance
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
pel program um pel education grants for
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated folks was uh eliminated
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
back in the 90s in the in the crime Bill
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
and uh there's been a desire really
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
arising from the prisons themselves and
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
others to say this is one of the best
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
tools we have to help recidivism
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development and uh atmosphere
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
within the in the prison is to be able
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
to have these educational programs um
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
available and the funding for them then
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
can come through the second chance pel
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh program so uh a year or so ago the
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
New England Board of higher education uh
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
on which which New Hampshire is a member
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
of is the six New England states which
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
deal with all kinds of educational
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
policy they got a planning Grant set to
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
commission to look at how we're going to
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
respond what what should the states do
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
what sort of Departments of Correction
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
do what should our uh University and
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
Community College uh system do um to be
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
ready for Second Chance uh P funding and
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
so you have before you a few pages of
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
that um report a little description of
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
what nebby itself uh does and I will
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%

01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
Services and we'll hear more about this
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but also then communitybased uh what
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
do we need to do to have support
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
services and make it seamless so trits
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
credits can transfer and that people
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
when they emerge from their educational
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
programs uh in prison if they want to
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
continue their education they haven't
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
completed a degree program we'll be able
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
to have the community wrap around the
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
easy entry into our community colleges
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
and uh University system um there are a
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
lot of recommendations that came out of
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
the commission that's what commissions
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
do as you know uh I wanted to focus in
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill on the um state level
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations which you will see
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
listed on the next page of your um
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
handout and so what this bill does is it
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
provides us really with the
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
liaison uh it through this body that
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
will the bill will set up so that we can
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
work uh with these Partners um in state
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
and out of state to do what we need to
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
do for our department of corrections um
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
other states around the region are uh
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
taking similar approaches to this or
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat different approaches that you
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
know each state is different and the
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh is
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
different as well so to just to return
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill um you'll see who is uh on
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
it I I do really want to commend the
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
leadership of uh commissioner Hanks and
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
we have Nick Nick Duffy here from
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh who have
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
been really instrumental not only in the
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
commission when it was uh meeting last
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
year but also in shaping this bill so
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
that it could work for the Department of
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
Corrections um and then also want to
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
particularly um thank both the uh
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
University system and particularly the
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
community college system because they're
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're the first ones who will
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
be stepping up to help um provide these
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
programs um you'll see uh other uh
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
people who you know will be connected to
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
the goals of the overall program
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative Services Department of
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh Employment Security so we
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
can have kind of have a sense of how is
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
this educ education the kinds of
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
programs people are going to take and
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
actually connect to jobs that they can
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
get um and I will note that a lot of
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
businesses now are actually looking at
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs and work
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for incarcerated folks um
 
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
and so it' be a good opportunity to uh I
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
I thought to make sure we're having the
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
education connect to actual skills uh
 
01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.350 align:start position:0%
education connect to actual skills uh
and

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
employability um and that's why we also
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
have the Department of Business and
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs um of course Department
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
division of adult
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
education we will certainly be looking
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
at those uh incarcerated folks who may
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
need um some adult education services to
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
make sure they're ready to take college
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
level uh uh courses um and then um
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
design from the Newland Board of higher
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
education because of all the money that
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
potentially be flowing to us from the
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
board of higher education uh to help
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
fund through grants some of our
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
activities um that's I thought that
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good person to have on here
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
and um get some advice somebody who was
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
formally incarcerated and did education
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
in prison as well so we can know kind of
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
what works for for the people that we're
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
um hoping to focus on in in this um so
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see the duties here uh and you
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
know as you're familiar with in these
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh of bodies um the kinds of
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
things they need to do starting the
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one of the the bill what
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
kind of Partnerships do we need so we
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh credits work and
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
programs work uh treit credit impacts
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's something that's
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
important now throughout the system you
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to create the seamless
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
flow from high school to community
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
colleges to University and we want to
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that um whatever programming
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
and educational program people take in
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
while incarcerated that they have a a
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
seamless credit transfer when they want
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
to continue their education any college
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
readiness programs that we uh we might
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
need through adult education um are
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
there ways in which we don't have to
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel if there's a good
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
program or course being offered at
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
another New England College University
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
um through the New England Board of
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
higher education one of of our huge
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
benefits out of that is that we get New
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students of any kind get to
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
take um courses at the other
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
institutions throughout New England if
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're offered without having to pay um
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
so that that might be a way to uh save
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
us some money and the cost of setting up
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
programs if there's already one existing
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
that people can participate um look at
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
the labor market needs
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
um as you know we're looking to build a
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
new uh Men's prison um we have a pretty
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
good facility for the women now and so
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
in that process uh ongoing discussions
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
about how they going to be facility
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
needs now and in the future for
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
educational um
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
programming uh and um career
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
Pathways um how the pel grant funding
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
supplemented when individuals
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
leave uh incarceration and I've had some
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with the um university
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
system and they have their granted
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
promise where they agree to top off the
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
costs beyond what pel grants provide and
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
that would apply to this population as
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
as well um take a look at are there
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to be any budget needs and we're
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
can we get some funding I mentioned
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get money money through the
 
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:43.639 align:start position:0%
ascendium grants you've got a in your
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
handout a couple of this has just been
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
announced but a couple of preliminary
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
things of how the money is going to flow
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
over the next few years and the kinds of
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
buckets that it's going to go into and
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunities that we will have
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%

uh what they shall do and it says
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%

01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
that looked on that I figured you
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
know we want to slip one in to go
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
International on us can I ask a follow
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman and I'm an English
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
Professor you know there you go thank
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
you representative wheer absolutely at
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
what point will Oxford be involved in
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
this goad represent um thank you Mr
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
chairman my followup uh has to do with
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh page one line 17 where you state that
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
a for formerly incarcerated person
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
appointed by the director of
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services um uh will be a
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
part of this and I just was wondering
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
what you think the criteria that the
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
director will use to choose that person
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
will be well thank you for the question
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll answer it in two ways I mean
 
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
Nick is here and he can he can tell you
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I I think this is important in
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
part because of the experience that we
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
had on the England Board of higher
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
education uh commission where there were
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
were quite a quite a number of formally
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated folks and um you know such
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
a range of people who had gotten out
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
started very successful businesses um or
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know doing other interesting things
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
with their lives and they could talk
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
very directly to the impacts but also
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
what programs
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
worked uh you know in the incarcerated
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
setting what what do they need what what
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
worked um and the message we got loud
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
and clear is we want things that really
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
can can contribute to our being
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
able to get out into the world and have
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
a have a good job um and so that that
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
was very important to hear and the gamut
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
of people um what they studied you know
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
from some social work to uh
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
Finance um
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
psychology uh you know the commissioner
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
of Department of Corrections uh Hanks
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
wanted us to change the title of this to
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
include vocational which is good
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so anyways I think that's that's what
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
can be contributed here and the criteria
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
um you know what I had imagined and
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
discussed on this was it would be
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
someone who had participated in um
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
educational programs um while
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated uh and then otherwise I
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
think Nick Duffy can tell you because
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
he's the person who you know handles
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
Release represent Mar thank you for
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um current certainly
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
um residents could take classes while
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and pay per credit um and I
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
just wonder what's going to happen when
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
the uh grant money does dry up is this
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a tax a burden for the
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thanks for the question um
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
unless the the Congress
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
repeals the eligibility for pel Grants
 
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
this funding will be available for the
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future so it's like pel
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
grants in general it it's you know the
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
pel grant program has been around for a
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
long time been funded for a long time um
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's what's driving
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
this now the the grants and things I
 
01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
think are kind of startup
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
funding um and uh you know that's why on
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
page two um you know consider I think
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
the question you raised a good one you
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
know what about the taxpayer and that's
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
why I put on um line 16 on page two to
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
we really to hear from this group just
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
that answer to your question and uh how
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
do we how do we plan for it but I think
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
the federal money is pretty
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
secure for as long as there's pel grants
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
in the future um but any if there are
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
any additional costs we got to we got to
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
get a hand on it and to be clear this
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't commit us to
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
spending any money it just would commits
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
them to telling us if they need money
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
and why is that correct thank you Mr
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
chairman this you know like most of
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
these if this is coordination
 
01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.470 align:start position:0%
these if this is coordination
and

01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
study that's what the bill
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
is see no further questions thank you
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
hos

01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
hos
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe HW I live in
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
gilmington I put my post office box on
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
my pink card and I put three minutes and
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
I have three items I'd like to talk
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
about and number one is
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh page one line number
 
01:45:48.189 --> 01:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
22 where it says other and then it has
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
the word corrections but before that it
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
has a higher education
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
so after the word education should be
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
like County houses of
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
Correction the superintendent uh should
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
be included I think in order to have
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
that other for Corrections because
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's no Corrections before that in
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
that uh paragraph Roman numeral
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
3 and uh line number 19 above that where
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
OPC that's office of professional lure
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's currently
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh headed by Lindsey Courtney the
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
attorney Michael Courtney's wife he's up
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
in Hatfield she's working over there and
 
01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add in there maybe
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
o the oplc director in good standing and
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
when I say good standing because I was
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
over there yesterday and I have a real
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
estate uh complaint there of June
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
2022 they take up to a year to
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
investigate it took 14 months for a
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
decision and it took another 6 months
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
for the decision to be sent to me that's
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and even the uh chairman over
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
there Mr Valentine he says we got to get
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
this backlog dealt with it's just like
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission I don't know
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
if you heard about that or not but uh
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
she asked for four more investigators
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu said I'm going to give
 
01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
you three she said no no I need four so
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
she got four and there shouldn't be a
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
backlog to begin with I just am upset
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
that uh you know you just presume that
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director isn't good
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
standing over there I just that's my you
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
know beef with uh the process over there
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's free there no no charge
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
for a filing fee for a complaint but
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's not complete and it's not you know
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
article 14 free complete impr prompt my
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights it's not and my last
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
Point number three is on page
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
two uh line
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
16 uh where it says f Federal funding
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to add in uh just like the
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh let me give you an example first the
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
US uh Marshall over there at the federal
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
building it says his oath of office is
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
to execute lawful precepts and I saw
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
the US Marshall woman over there
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday I said well what does that
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
mean does that mean that some are
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
unlawful and uh you know I won't get
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
into all the detail but I just would
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
like to put in there before the word
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
federal legal and lawful Federal funding
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
because this state operates I was told
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
by Bob
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
G him former Senator he he told danan
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
Richard who told me he said the state
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
operates on 40% Federal funding so
 
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
unless that Federal funding comes in a
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
lot of these state things aren't going
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
to be done and I'm really upset with the
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
feds I mean uh if somebody owes money
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
like on a
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
tax do they have a course with X number
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
of classes in that subject matter of
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration my friend Ed Brown over in

planfield he was arrested and sent to
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
the FCI federal correctional institute
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
have courses with classes there are none
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
in his subject matter and it's it was
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%

of our institutions were approved for um

currently are working with um students

Community College is the campus that is
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
offering those programs
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the initial group of students
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
started about a year ago in March taking
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
classes in um business administration
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
and liberal arts programs working toward
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
their associate
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
degree um we have um been working
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
closely also with our colleagues at the
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire to
 
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
work on transfer Pathways for those
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
students when they complete their
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
Associate Degree for those who wish to
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
to continue their education at the B at
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
the Balor level and we are also grateful
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the partnership with the Department
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
of Corrections on this on this um
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
program and area offering prison
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
education programming is not without
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
challenges so the idea of a Planning
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
Group that can bring together uh
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
relevant stakeholders is is a is a very
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
um good and useful beneficial idea
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
matters like um coordinating planning
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
and evaluation and looking at what can
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
be available for resources are matters
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
that this group could um could work on
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
together effectively um Senator Waters
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the sort of attributes
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
or or out expected outcomes of of prison
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
education and one of them is
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
self-efficacy and I'd like to just share
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
a brief story um with with the cohort of
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
students that we were working with at up
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
at White Mountains Community College at
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
the Northern New Hampshire Correctional
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
Facility they they they told a story
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
where um they tried to advocate for
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
something a few months a few months
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
before the program started I think it
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
was additional recreational time and it
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
didn't go very well their attempts to
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate but they said after we took our
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
first college composition course and we
 
01:51:58.830 --> 01:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
learned things like how to communicate
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
differently how to communicate more
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
effectively and then they went back and
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
they tried again and they were
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
successful that time um in getting what
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
what they what they needed and so not
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
only does this type of of of Program
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
help incarcerated individuals Post
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
relase in getting um employment and um
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
avoiding you know recidivism but it also
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
helps them to kind of learn and practice
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
those skills while they're still inside
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
the walls and and maybe improve their
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
their lives there and create a safer
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
environment so we're very supportive of
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
this bill um we thank the sponsor for um
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
engaging Us in its Drafting and um we
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
look forward to working as part of this
 
01:52:38.589 --> 01:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
task force if if this bill does get pass
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
Muse one thing I'm just guessing is that
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh can't offer all of your curriculum uh
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
to to folks so how do you how do you
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
make that decision or is that something
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for uh guidance
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
on I would I would I would say that um
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues that have to
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
do with things like first all faculty
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
who are who are available and willing to
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
teach you know within a prison setting
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
um things like equipment and technology
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
that can or can't be used in a prison
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
settings so those are some of the
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
considerations um I I might heard it Mr
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
Duffy from the Department to be a little
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
more specific about that I myself am not
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
directly involved in the program so I
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
might not have all the details that
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
for further
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.440 --> 01:54:09.310 align:start position:0%
 
stuffy

01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
good on now thank you for allowing me to
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
speak today um my name is Nick Duffy I'm
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
the director of rehability of services
 
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections um again uh as Senator
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
Waters was um mentioning uh education is
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
extremely important um for for in
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals incarcerated from making
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they have the skills needed
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
upon release um it helps lower
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
recidivism there's study after study
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
that shows just how important that um
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
education is and then the higher level
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
of Education that somebody can get while
 
01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um means that that level of
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
recidivism continues to decrease so with
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
each degree level of recidivism drops
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
drastically and that um is through the
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
Rand study um that uh that information
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
is so you can look that up
 
01:54:57.199 --> 01:54:59.189 align:start position:0%
is so you can look that up
um

01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh we we believe that this um this
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee would be extremely beneficial
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
um although we are doing these
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
connections now and having some of this
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
these conversations but bringing this
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
together with specific goals in mind in
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
order to uh not just the Department of
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections having those conversations
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
individually with each of these groups
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
with all the groups coming together
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of resources ideas each
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
state is doing things a little bit
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
differently um and so collectively
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
coming together and having these
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
conversations and figuring out how to
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
for long-term sustainability to make
 
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
sure that um it just isn't put on the
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to pay for um programming or um
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
or the residents to try to find a way to
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
um pay for this themselves but a way
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
that we can find um long-term
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability keep costs down and
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
provide as much education as we can um
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
incarceration thank you I'm willing to
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
take any questions you have at this time
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cel thank you and thank
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm wondering
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
if you might be able to share with us a
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
unexpected success story from one of
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
your uh someone who who participated in
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
this kind of a program yeah so I think
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of um success stories
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
that I could probably uh draw from but
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
overall I think there's you know there
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
was a couple years ago one of our high
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
school graduations um you know it there
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
was a individual who was struggling to
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
sort of keep up with his high school
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
education um and his son was going to
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
drop out of school and he said that he
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
basically came up with an agreement with
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
his son you stay in I'll stay in and so
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
they completed together um and I think
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing is it's it's
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
not just even about them but it's about
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
generational incarceration and
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
generational um impacts at this has and
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
so the more that they can get and see
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
that okay my dad was able to do this or
 
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
mom was able to do this the more that um
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
that the their children can see okay now
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is I can do this as well so um
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
although that was a high school um
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
example I think that um it's it's it the
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
the example that they're setting for
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
their children the example they're
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
setting for um their own future and he
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
said it was a rough patch but that was
 
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
he was able to overcome it and and um
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
and uh has been extremely successful
 
01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:26.189 align:start position:0%
and uh has been extremely successful
since

01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
so as part of the work product for this
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
group will it be um kind of a a a sort
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
of um public relations type thing
 
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
whereas you're going to show the the
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
return on investment to be able to so
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
that whatever portion does end up coming
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
from Public Funding that the cost
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
benefit is it weighs in favor of helping
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
with the education versus further en
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
eration given the the current public um
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
issues regarding student loan debt I
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
feel like there will be some people
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
saying wait a minute why why are we
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
doing this and the mine's not getting
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
paid to show them well actually it saves
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
you money by doing this that type of
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
thing yeah absolutely and I think that's
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
where grants are really helpful because
 
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
they can show the success of something
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
then say well yes it might cost a little
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
bit more long term for us but this
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
investment can save us so much more um
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
down the road and I think that's really
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
what we need to show this is is not just
 
01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
about um doing it but is it working and
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have programs that
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
aren't working and and just sort of
 
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
waste of money this we know that um
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
these types of Investments has shown to
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
be successful but we need to show it
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
successful within our within our own
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
programs as well and bring that data
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
forward and and say in our reports and
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
and what we're reporting this is what
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
the impact has been very good thank you
 
01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
the impact has been very good thank you
representative

01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.629 align:start position:0%
representative
n

01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
n
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um last year in a
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
hearing about um
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh we were talking about
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
essentially what would commonly be known
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
as you know time off for good behavior
 
01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
um and one of the you know was a variety
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
of programs that you could go through uh
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
we had someone who came in and spoke to
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
um uh things like education being one of
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
those uh where the financial uh they did
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
not have the uh financial means to be
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
able to do that so I was wondering if
 
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
you could uh speak a little bit to the
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
way that this levels the playing field
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to um rather than
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
financial uh having a financial barrier
 
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
having it be based on uh Merit and their
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
determination and and what they do with
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
it so currently with um with uh earn
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
time credit is that uh there is already
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
that in place where they depending on
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the degree they get they can get earn
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
time credit for um currently right now
 
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
um they would have to pay for those that
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
themselves unless they're participating
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
in our um our current pel um classes
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
so you're right is that somebody needs
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
the financial ability to be able to um
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
do the correspondence courses or um or
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
participate in that way this really
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be about um our current standards
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
are more about remaining um as doing the
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
right things remaining disciplinary free
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
making sure that you're um being a good
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
citizen within our our environment to be
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
selected for this um this program and so
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
there is a huge Advantage for us as well
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
just from a behavioral standpoint to get
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
people to do the right things in order
 
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
to go into this program um so in the in
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that respect um somebody who has a
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
financial barrier to pay for higher ed
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
well that will remove that um Financial
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
barrier um again this committee itself
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
is really um uh we're already working
 
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
toward pel grants and we're already
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
doing pel grants and so that's already
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
happening I think um this committee is
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
really about ensuring long-term
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability of those
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
represent BR thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at it real quickly
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's in here and I and I passed it
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
up please um excuse that is would this
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
be effective for every person regardless
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
of if whether it's a life sentence or
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
so uh pel you mean pel pel funding can
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
you get pel funding regardless of your
 
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
sentence the so the so the education
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is yeah that is being discussed
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
here yeah would that be available to to
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
every per to every inmate regardless of
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the sentence yeah so we we offer
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
education to anyone regardless of their
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
um of their sentence structure so
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether they um have a life sentence or
 
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
um they're going to be there various
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
amount of years however prior priority
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
is given to people who have um have less
 
02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
time to to achieve that while
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so if somebody only has a
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
couple years um they would probably be
 
02:02:00.270 --> 02:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
able to get into the program quicker if
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
there's weight list for that program um
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure they can
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
get that um prior release um if there's
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
room in a program you know space
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
available in the program we do allow um
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
any sentence structure to um participate
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
and I think there is um data to show
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
that even for individuals who aren't
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to be released um there's benefits
 
02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
to that um uh just institutional
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%

House criminal justice committee it's
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
great to be here for the record my name
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
is Senator Howard Pearl I am the senator
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
from District 17 I live in the Great
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
town of Lowden I am here today to
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
322 this bill requires a licensing
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and excuse me this bill
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
requires a li license authorizing an IND
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
individual to carry a loaded pistol or
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
revolver in the state to include the
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
name title and signature of the person
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
issuing the license the bill further
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
provides immunity to law enforcement
 
02:03:34.109 --> 02:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
officers who in good faith issue these
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
licenses under the RSA so the background
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
on this why I put this bill in which is
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
always important is a constituent came
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
to me with a situation where they had uh
 
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
received a license to carry and you know
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
as you recall back when we did
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry we left that
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
provision in that folks could get a
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
license so that if they wanted to carry
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
in other states they could enjoy
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and the individual that came
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
to me their their police chief would not
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
sign the license because they for
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that they had an issue with the
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
Constitutional carry itself not so much
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
the person you know not my constituent
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
but they just didn't want to sign any of
 
02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
them because they felt that the
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
Constitutional carry provision had taken
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
away their ability to decide if someone
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
was suitable or not and only allowed the
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
federal prohibitions on whether they
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
could issue a
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
license so when that happened this now
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
leaves you excuse me you me anyone else
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
whose Chief decides that they didn't
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
want to sign the license with a a carry
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
license but it's not signed well that's
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
a potential problem if you're traveling
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
and you want to go to another
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction where they recognize our
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
license you know we have reciprocity
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
with them you get in a situation where
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
you get pulled over for whatever reason
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're now carrying a firearm with a
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
license to not signed that's a real
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
potential issue and so that was the
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
Genesis for me putting in this bill and
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
as you'll see all it does is it requires
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
that the uh issuing um municipality that
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
the officer who's issuing it that they
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
sign it and that they put their name
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
title and their signature on it now in
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
return U the we made sure I believe they
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
already had immunity from acting in
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
their capacity as an officer and doing
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
their official duty but just to be sure
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
we also included the IM Immunity Clause
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
in this bill to make sure that it was
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
very clear that they had no personal um
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
liability on on doing their job so that
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
is the uh nuts and bolts of the bill I
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
do have my constituent here today to
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
testify on the bill on as well so that
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh she was willing to come in and step
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
up and tell her story here as well so if
 
02:05:47.069 --> 02:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
um you'll have an opportunity from here
 
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
to hear from her too if you have
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
specific um questions for her about the
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
Court situation that she went to to try
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
through to try and compel the uh the
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
signature on her license so with that I
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
will take any
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator so just for
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
the to be clear for the committee New
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a sh issue state is that
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
that correct I'm sorry I didn't hear you
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a sh issue state is
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
that correct so a chief has no
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
discretion unless you are a prohibited
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
person by federal law they have to give
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
you the permit correct does the permit
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a space on it for the uh Chief
 
02:06:26.189 --> 02:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
signature yes so they were not
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
completing the the form properly is what
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing some of the chiefs were
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
put great question and thank you some of
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
the chiefs were putting per RSA rather
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
than their signature on it and boy I
 
02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if I get pulled over in a
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
another state and I pull that out saying
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
I have a right to have a concealed
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
carryer I'm not sure that that would
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
give me the confidence I wouldn't end up
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
with some legal issues that I didn't
 
02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
want yeah I I would hate to be in
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
Alabama trying to explain what RSA means
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
there you have it
 
02:06:54.669 --> 02:06:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stone thank you thank
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh during
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
your research for this bill did you find
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
that this was an ongoing problem with
 
02:07:01.149 --> 02:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
many agencies or just a handful of
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
agencies in New Hampshire I don't know
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
the exact number and that's a great
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
question but there are some I did work
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the uh the chief's Association and
 
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
worked with uh with them on trying to
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
craft a some language that would be
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable to them there's still some
 
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
resistance from some of the Chiefs but
 
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
they do understand that they have a duty
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
to do and uh that the giving you know
 
02:07:24.189 --> 02:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
clear clearly spelling out that the uh
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
the immunity in this bill helped ease
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that they had
 
02:07:29.079 --> 02:07:29.910 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that they had
follow

02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
up in your opinion in the research
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
you've done isn't it uh kind of
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
obligated by their office of chief of
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
police to sign these forms if there's no
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
reason to deny a
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
license I felt that was the case but the
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
court and again I'll let my uh
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
constituent talk about her court case
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
and the Court ruling that came through
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
essentially my understanding is the
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
court uh said that you know they they
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to issue the license but it wasn't
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
clear that they had to sign it so we're
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
making it clear that they have to sign
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
it and that's what compelled this
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%

morning

02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
um well I'll just start my story um I
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
had already had a
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
signed um concealed carry permit issued
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
to me in
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
2015 and basically what I'm going to go
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
through is just the the court case and
 
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
then the judgment and I have copies for
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
everybody of both uh because the exhibit
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's exhibits and and if you um you
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to get into the detail if you
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't want you can just give us
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
basically the timeline on what happened
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
and what the judge said yeah I'm going
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
to give you the reader's dive just for
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
and if you want to hand out more
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
in-depth stuff for us to read we'd be
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take it okay um so I did have a
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
ass signed permit and there is a picture
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
of it in here um I went to renew it um
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that was after conceal uh
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry had passed so that
 
02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
2019 um nothing had changed I'm not a
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited person I'm actually a
 
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
certified NRA instructor as well as a
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
range safety officer I have a ton of
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
certificates um and I'm highly
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
trained so when I went to uh go get it
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019 I picked it
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
up um and instead of it looking like the
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
one that I had before
 
02:09:55.629 --> 02:09:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
said uh where it has authorized
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
signature it says per RSA
 
02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.310 align:start position:0%
signature it says per RSA
159

02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
159
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
-6 um so I question it because of it not
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
being a signature and there is no title
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
given on there um I do travel to other
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
states um and like you said before I
 
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to explain something
 
02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:16.350 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to explain something
in

02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
Alabama because it just doesn't look
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
like it's filled out um so so I went
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
back and I was like you know to the
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
chief I'm like what is this and he's
 
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
like well per constitutional carry
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
passing um I I'm not signing any of them
 
02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
so I was like oh great um in addition to
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
that there was an issue too um he didn't
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
issue it for the correct number of years
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so I got an attorney um the attorney
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
contacted him we got another um pistol
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
revolver license that had the correct
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
number of years but he still refused to
 
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
sign it um he worked with my attorney a
 
02:11:01.629 --> 02:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
little bit um so it actually went to
 
02:11:08.109 --> 02:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
court um and the judge found that RSA
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
1596 does not require Chief signature in
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
order for the license to be validly
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
issued however he must include his name
 
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
as chief of police of northward as it is
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
the chief who has the authority to issue
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
such licenses not the police department
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
generally so
 
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
um basically what she said that the RSA
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed uh because there is
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in the RSA currently
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
that says he has to sign it so I did get
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
another one it has his um title on it
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
but it still says P
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
RSA so all I'm looking for is to have my
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
PRL look like everybody else's and not
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
give I get a hairy eyebrow when I do
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
have to show
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is he currently still the chief yes I
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
see okay and are you aware of any other
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
um in your experience working with
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
firearms and things are you aware of any
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
other Chiefs that are doing this is this
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
some kind of a movement or what it's
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's not just my chief there are others
 
02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
um uh my attorney Evan napen he was
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
working with a couple other people or
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
had spoken to a couple other people at
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%

enjoyed your
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
lunch uh it is
 
03:30:41.229 --> 03:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
1:00 um so we are going to open up our
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon hearings and I would just like
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody before We Begin that
 
03:30:50.590 --> 03:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
looking at our agenda it would appear
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
that several of our bills may end up
 
03:30:54.990 --> 03:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
being a little bit controversial so I
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
would just like to remind the committee
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to ask a question
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
please just remember to keep your
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
opinions for the executive session and
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
just please remember to State the
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
question from the get-go that would be
 
03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
helpful and we recognize Senator abbis
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
to introduce his
 
03:31:14.920 --> 03:31:19.469 align:start position:0%
to introduce his
bill

03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone uh Senator Daryl
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
abbis I represent District 22 I serving
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
the communities of Pelham Salem aent and
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
plastow I'm here to introduce Senate
 
03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:31.229 align:start position:0%
plastow I'm here to introduce Senate
Bill

03:31:31.229 --> 03:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:31:33.790 --> 03:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
248 as the prime sponsor this language
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
may look very familiar as Senate Bill
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
252 that this committee passed I know
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
there was some amendments there but
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
there were two the two Senate bills
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
filed at the same time we felt it was
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
important to one on the poliy alone was
 
03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
worth passing it again out of the Senate
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
but also um without knowing when we did
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
pass it we weren't sure what the status
 
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the um Senate Bill 252 would have
 
03:31:57.309 --> 03:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
been but those the original Bill the
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
languages are identical there is a
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
actual uh Gap in the bail system the
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
bail laws right now the
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
procedure if someone is arrested and if
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's a I guess if the state would
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
like to request a dangerousness hearing
 
03:32:13.150 --> 03:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
or have someone held because they
 
03:32:14.309 --> 03:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
believe them to be a threat to
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
themselves or to the public they they
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
can request that hearing but it has to
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
be done uh it's a 48 hour notice so in
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
theory this person could be held to be a
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
danger to themsel or someone else
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
however they've been
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
released uh into the public or been
 
03:32:32.750 --> 03:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
released by a bail commissioner before
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
that hearing would ever happen uh so if
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the list of offenses and
 
03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
they're all all the offenses listed all
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
of them are there the two types of
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
crimes a violent crime with the victim
 
03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
is a human being or it's a sex crime
 
03:32:48.349 --> 03:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
against a
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
child those are the crimes all listed
 
03:32:53.710 --> 03:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
all of those are egregious
 
03:32:55.710 --> 03:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
offenses uh I hope you leave all those
 
03:32:59.830 --> 03:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
in there because uh they are all serious
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
offenses many of those offenses are
 
03:33:04.750 --> 03:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
elevating offenses uh some of those are
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
crimes where the victim never recovers
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh particularly child
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
pornography that image never goes away
 
03:33:15.070 --> 03:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
once it's out there it's out there and
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
the courts have been very consistent
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
when you support that market by simply
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
possessing the the material you're
 
03:33:23.950 --> 03:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging the the activity a lot of
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is a lot of those um Productions
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
are made overseas so we can't always
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily stop that but we certainly
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to support the market uh also
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
many individuals um who are charged with
 
03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
that are considered to be dangerous
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
because one they're they tend to not be
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
willing to serve out the offense you had
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
an issue in Florida where the federal
 
03:33:45.150 --> 03:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
government was executing an arrest
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
warrant uh for child pornography and two
 
03:33:50.510 --> 03:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
agents were uh actually shot through the
 
03:33:54.910 --> 03:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
door and died so these type of offenses
 
03:33:56.110 --> 03:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
all it's going to do is they're going to
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
be held and we're not saying bail
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are doing a bad job but
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to be held until they're
 
03:34:03.070 --> 03:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
brought before a judge I understand
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a desire or appetite for
 
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
magistrates uh that's something that's
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know a work in progress but in the
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
meantime uh we shouldn't jeopardize
 
03:34:13.389 --> 03:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
Public Safety while we work that
 
03:34:13.399 --> 03:34:14.710 align:start position:0%
Public Safety while we work that
procedure

03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
out I think this this is an opportunity
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
for us to do the right thing and fix
 
03:34:22.510 --> 03:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
that procedural Gap and I hope you all
 
03:34:24.349 --> 03:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
support the ought to pass I'll answer
 
03:34:24.359 --> 03:34:28.030 align:start position:0%
support the ought to pass I'll answer
any

03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative scitec isn't
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
this duplicative you you I thought you
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
said that so why are we why are we
 
03:34:40.469 --> 03:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
passing this if two 318 for example well
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
well stting the obvious I I like my
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
version the bill that I file better than
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
the other one I wish I filed first by
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
the way but it but but that aside uh I
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
believe the bill was actually amended
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 so this kind of gives
 
03:34:58.510 --> 03:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
you a chance to reconsider whatever was
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
done in that also uh when we bid pass
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
this we weren't all clear what would
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:11.070 --> 03:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
be um I think part of the change was to
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
change domestic violence to
 
03:35:15.750 --> 03:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
felony domestic violence can you live
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
with that as opposed to
 
03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:20.550 align:start position:0%
with that as opposed to
misdemeanor

03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
um sexual domestic
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
violence can I ask for clar is that the
 
03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
only offense that you want to remove I
 
03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to remove them all but I think this
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
is probably the most reasonable one
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
because I in my view I think a bail
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner would probably not release
 
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
any I would not release any of these
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
people I and I don't need the law to
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
tell me that because I recog recogniz
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that there are danger I don't want to
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
preach the one that is most that is so
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
routine I've done 500 I'm picking it and
 
03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not wrong by much misdemeanor uh
 
03:36:01.870 --> 03:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence where somebody slams
 
03:36:04.510 --> 03:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
the door pulls a phone off the wall uh
 
03:36:07.950 --> 03:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
throws something and you
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
know there's no real uh no real assault
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
No Bottle injury no I didn't say I'm not
 
03:36:16.279 --> 03:36:17.269 align:start position:0%
No Bottle injury no I didn't say I'm not
forgiving

03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
forgiving
 
03:36:20.429 --> 03:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
or saying it's not serious but it's a
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crime not a felony he didn't
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
grab her by the throat throw her around
 
03:36:27.150 --> 03:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
thing so so I'm looking to can you my
 
03:36:33.870 --> 03:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
question is can you live with
 
03:36:33.880 --> 03:36:35.870 align:start position:0%
question is can you live with
misdemeanor

03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
03:36:40.269 --> 03:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
um leaving in misdemeanor domestic
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
violence so I I wish every bail
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner would take the position you
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
you are you're taking but obviously we
 
03:36:48.990 --> 03:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
can't we can't do
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a tough pillow to swallow
 
03:36:54.429 --> 03:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
someone who's represented both victims
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence and people who have
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
committed horrible
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
crimes domestic violence tends to
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
escalate it's Al Al also one of the most
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
underreported crimes out there so my
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
experience working on the ground level
 
03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
in interacting with indiv idual
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
individuals without getting into those
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
details I I would strongly strongly
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
recommend against that with that being
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
said would I would I support the whole
 
03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill go not passing IID have to think
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
about it but when I when I say when you
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
said if no assault
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
happens if no assault happens there's no
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it's because that
 
03:37:43.229 --> 03:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
whatever conduct they engaged in put
 
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
that person in fear for their safety and
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the that's one of the
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
standards so if they're ripping a phone
 
03:37:52.030 --> 03:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
off the wall and and making you know
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
threats on top of that and this is an
 
03:37:54.439 --> 03:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
threats on top of that and this is an
escalating

03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
escalating
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
situation I would I would I would uh be
 
03:38:03.389 --> 03:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
that we had a case in this state where a
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
person was arrested for domestic
 
03:38:10.269 --> 03:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
violence was released by Bill
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then that that same
 
03:38:16.030 --> 03:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
within that night went to the victim's
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
house broke in and sexually assaulted
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
her while her child was in the room so
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
again escalating
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
offenses we're trying to address the
 
03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
offenses we're trying to address the
most

03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
egregious situations that arose from
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
bail reform Without Really backtracking
 
03:38:32.830 --> 03:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
or erasing the whole
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
system rep representative scitec I I
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
feel like we're getting down into an
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
argumentative path so is this that's
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what it's going to say I'm not I
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to debate it but it would be
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
fine thank you representative Murray
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair repres stices a
 
03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
friend by the
 
03:38:51.070 --> 03:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
way um so if I remember correctly the
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
way we amend and I was on the bail
 
03:38:55.389 --> 03:38:55.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the way we amended
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
s252 was to remove like representative
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
scitech is saying the misdemeanor level
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence um but we also um
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
lowered the standard for um like
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
dangerousness to the public so instead
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
of it being
 
03:39:15.790 --> 03:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
um uh it's basically between
 
03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence and clear
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence um so it also
 
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for them to hold someone
 
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
um if they are considered a danger to
 
03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
the public I'm just wondering if you've
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review the bill and like
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
have um any yeah thoughts on if this is
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
really needed with the compromise we
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
already arrived to as a
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
house so that it's now the legal
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
standard in between clear and convincing
 
03:39:42.030 --> 03:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
evidence in preponderance of evidence I
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's a substantial evidence which is
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be yeah between those
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
two I suppose if you want to articulate
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
a fact pattern to decipher between th
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
what would meet one and not the other I
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
understand lowering the burden I think
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof is really it's I I
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
think it's important that the state if
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
they want someone to be
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
held you know in pre-trial detention
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
they should meet their burden of clear
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence I think that's
 
03:40:10.349 --> 03:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
fair because person hasn't been
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
convicted I mean there is two sides of
 
03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
it but when someone's charged with a
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
violent offense with whe the victims a
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
person or sex crimes against children
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is that that bail hearing
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
they be held and can be overnight it can
 
03:40:25.469 --> 03:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
be for a day or two that's how that's
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
just how our system is right now I I
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
would prefer that to be in front of a
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
judge because what happens is when
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
people are released by a bill
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner the practice is that they
 
03:40:37.469 --> 03:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
wave their arraignment and then that
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
person is not going to be in court for
 
03:40:42.030 --> 03:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
quite some time so all this is that's
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
really what we're trying to do is is get
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
this person in front of a judge that's
 
03:40:47.309 --> 03:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's not even to say the state is going
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
to ask for the person to be held on
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detention that they may agree
 
03:40:54.670 --> 03:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
to personal recog that's up to the the
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor on that particular case if
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
they want to go forward with that
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and the person is held then that
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
the defendant would be able to then
 
03:41:05.309 --> 03:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
challenge that I the procedure is
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
already in the law for that I believe
 
03:41:09.790 --> 03:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's 48 hours at a that's that's the
 
03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
minimum I mean uh excuse me the maximum
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
time they would have to wait unless they
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
requested more
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
but more importantly to me is that it's
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
not saying that no matter what they're
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
going to be held so I think keeping the
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
higher standards appropriate for know
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues or like Liberty
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
arguments but at the same time I don't
 
03:41:31.149 --> 03:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
see the harm in them being brought
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
before a
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
judge thank you for answering my
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
question um and thank you and
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
um uh so to to be clear the reason why
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
you think this bill UMB 320 or SP 248 is
 
03:41:48.510 --> 03:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
necessary is because we don't know how
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
the magistrate thing is going to play
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
out and we need to address these issues
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
right now um I guess one concern I'd
 
03:41:55.950 --> 03:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
bring before you that we heard um during
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is the public defenders
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
um talking about just their own capacity
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
to because when it goes before a judge
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
then they are required to have um an
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
attorney a public defender assigned to
 
03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
them and under that timeline it can be
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
kind of hard and then the capacity um
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
increases so I'm just curious if you
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
talked with them or if you've heard
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
anything about their almost inability to
 
03:42:20.670 --> 03:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
potentially be able to meet this
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
standard because of um the increase in
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
public defenders that would need to be
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
brought in at an earlier point in these
 
03:42:31.870 --> 03:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
cases so I think the the amount of uh
 
03:42:34.189 --> 03:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
hearings per day we did the math last
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
term so my numbers are a little bit
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
outdated uh in the sense that they from
 
03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:38.670 align:start position:0%
outdated uh in the sense that they from
more

03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
2022 but uh I think it was about around
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 per day throughout the entire
 
03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:46.830 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 per day throughout the entire
state

03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
I understand that some areas be more
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
populated but they also have more
 
03:42:52.830 --> 03:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
funding for legal aid in those areas uh
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are some legislation that's you
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
know out there to increase funding for
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
legal aid they're underfunded either way
 
03:43:01.229 --> 03:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
by the way so just keep that in mind
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
that if that comes up in future budgets
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
but they haven't brought that attention
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
to me but Public Safety is Public Safety
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
I understand that they may be meeting
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
that client for the first time that day
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't go well and the person
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know is not uh not released they can
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
ask for another hearing with within you
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
know a few days to get more evidence and
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
they can even have witnesses come in so
 
03:43:26.189 --> 03:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
and that cuts both ways because if the
 
03:43:28.349 --> 03:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is asking them them be held
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
quite often the prosecutor is also just
 
03:43:32.110 --> 03:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
getting that file that day because the
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
person was just arrest unless it's an
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
indictment representative Harry
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
cther you're you're good representative
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
Willer thank you madam chair
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Senator
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
abbis to hone in on what representative
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
Murray was saying it just feels a little
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
bit like Groundhog Day here when we're
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
seeing this bill again and I'm wondering
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
why why file this bill if we're in the
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
process of the houses passed on the
 
03:44:03.469 --> 03:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
consent calendar a number of bail bills
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee has taken them
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
up in a way which suggests their passing
 
03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
and and being moved to your body uh in
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
which case you would have the
 
03:44:12.590 --> 03:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to amend those and bring
 
03:44:14.429 --> 03:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
them back to us and I'm I'm a little
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
curious as to why we're creating another
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle for this issue to be dealt with
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the bium so first I
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
filed I filed this bill before the other
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
one it just that's just how how it
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
worked out 248 just just beat my my good
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
friend from from Manchester to the punch
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
who was sent a bill 252 I and I I did
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
ask uh her to co-sponsor this but I
 
03:44:38.349 --> 03:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
think it just kind of got lost in
 
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
Shuffle so the two bills were the exact
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
identical language um I let my I agreed
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
in gave the blessing and I testify in
 
03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
support of Senator susi's Bill passing
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh last year but we kept this and we
 
03:44:53.790 --> 03:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
re-referred it and held on to it again
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
without knowing the result of the bill
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh the magistrate bill it never hurts to
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
have two vehicles going in case one
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
falls apart which can happen based on
 
03:45:06.429 --> 03:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
attendance I'm sure this this body's
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
learned it all too well this term uh so
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
regardless the way you fall on that it
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
does not hurt to have two but I also
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
think that they're different because if
 
03:45:17.149 --> 03:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
the Magistrate um you know Provisions
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
don't go forward then you can at least
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate this on its own form without
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
the magistrate system but and maybe
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps consider which offenses you want
 
03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
to leave in I would recommend leaving
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
them all in but you know that's that's a
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
different conversation to
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
have I'm
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
also representative wheeler there's
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
nobody you can trust better than just
 
03:45:42.149 --> 03:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
yourself so I might be the reason why
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
people want to make sure that they're
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
good to go
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
I believe you had a competing bill as
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
well that you kind of get lost in the
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:54.750 --> 03:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
happens representative
 
03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:56.349 align:start position:0%
happens representative
Muse

03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
Muse
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
so just to sum up um one way to think of
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
your bill is as the kind of the before
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
Bill uh and Senator susi's Bill s252 is
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.229 --> 03:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
Bill well I I would say if you pass them
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
both and sign them both into law they
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
will from what I understand would
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
conflict with each other so that would
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
be ill
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
advised but I I think assuming one will
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
pass and one won't I would also be ill
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
advised so I think if one does not pass
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
and does not make it over the Finish
 
03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
Line this this is another vehicle to
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
consider because it does address I think
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
a procedural Gap in the the process I
 
03:46:41.229 --> 03:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
can't imagine someone's charged with you
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
know a discussing crime sex crime
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
against a child and the state wants that
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
person to be held you know not released
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know pending their trial because
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's a very egregious offense and we
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
have to get into the specific facts of
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
what that would be the person could be
 
03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
released awaiting that hearing which
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
that if this is a public safety concern
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
the person is actually found to be
 
03:47:05.070 --> 03:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous and there's sufficient
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
evidence of that it just seems odd that
 
03:47:10.110 --> 03:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
that that procedural Gap is there this
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
addresses that does this solve the
 
03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
entire problems of bail it no but it's I
 
03:47:15.870 --> 03:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
think to
 
03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
you looks like nobody else wants to ask
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
anything Senator you're
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
free thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
Rothstein

03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon my name is David
 
03:47:59.469 --> 03:47:59.479 align:start position:0%
Rothstein um I'm here uh on behalf of
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers and speaking in
 
03:48:06.510 --> 03:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this um this particular
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 248 and sitting here and in
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
talking to Professor Sher beforehand I'm
 
03:48:13.149 --> 03:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
gathering there's a lot of other moving
 
03:48:15.990 --> 03:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
Parts uh with respect to this issue and
 
03:48:17.790 --> 03:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill so some of
 
03:48:20.830 --> 03:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
what I say may not really matter if
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
there's other packages or Bills moving
 
03:48:24.910 --> 03:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
forward but I'm here so for what it's
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
worth I'll say what I came to say um
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um and potentially another one
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's move further in the process
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
purports to separate out certain
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
offenses for differential treatment
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
based upon uh the nature of the offense
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh alone the the title of the offense uh
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the criminal code um that is not
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
unprecedented the federal system uh does
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
this with respect to bail um in the
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
federal system there are a number of
 
03:48:54.910 --> 03:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
offenses that are segregated and treated
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
differently and pushed further more
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
toward a presumption of detention with
 
03:49:03.309 --> 03:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
respect to bail um for the most part
 
03:49:05.309 --> 03:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
these are mandatory minimum firearm
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
offenses uh cases where there's a
 
03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
destructive device used terrorism uh
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
offenses very serious drug offenses also
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
offenses in the federal system that are
 
03:49:16.590 --> 03:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
punished Able by up to life or death
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
such as treason uh aircraft piracy or or
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
homicide um so the the list and it also
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
I I will say the federal list does
 
03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
include crimes against minors which this
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
list also purports to include but for
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
the most part we're talking about some
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
of the most serious offenses that we
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
know or that we hear of we're talking
 
03:49:38.670 --> 03:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
about Timothy McVey we're talking about
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
people who have a very large amount of
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or Methamphetamine facing very
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
very ser serous time in prison otherwise
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
the federal system tends to favor uh
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
pre-trial release the federal system um
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
is supported by a very robust pre-trial
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
release system where there's a report
 
03:49:59.469 --> 03:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
done on basically every single defendant
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
that comes into the court and also um a
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
pre-trial supervision system that's
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
tailored to the circumstances of the
 
03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:06.790 align:start position:0%
tailored to the circumstances of the
individual

03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
offender um so what what's discussed
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
here is not without precedent but I
 
03:50:12.990 --> 03:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
think the Federalist and the federal
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
system is is different in a couple
 
03:50:14.359 --> 03:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
system is is different in a couple
respects

03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
respects
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
this separation of uh offenses for
 
03:50:20.309 --> 03:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
treatment on bail is also not without
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
president in our very bail statute under
 
03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:24.309 align:start position:0%
president in our very bail statute under
RSA

03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
5971 uh small C there is differential
 
03:50:30.429 --> 03:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
treat differential treatment already for
 
03:50:33.070 --> 03:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
those offenders who are accused of an
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
offense which is punishable by up to
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
life in prison in those situations it is
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh there's a whole different system set
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
forth in the statute um there is a very
 
03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
major burden um that has to be met a
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
much more significant burden that has to
 
03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
be met for a person facing uh a life
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
sentence than there is for any other
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
type of crime so we do already have that
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
um in our criminal code in our bail
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
statute for people who are charged with
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
the most serious
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
offenses so here we're talking about um
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
some offenses that are serious and I
 
03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
don't mean to suggest otherwise but are
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
not on the order of homicide so we have
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
a list and when we have a list there's
 
03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
typically a commonality among the items
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the list but this list lists it has
 
03:51:20.429 --> 03:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
homicide at the head of the list um and
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
it has a number of other uh types of
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
crimes that um in in my view and in the
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
view of the criminal code are not
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably comparable in terms of the
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
penalty and in terms of the ultimate
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
sentence that a person is likely to
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
serve as you probably know um and as I
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
know well from defending many people
 
03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
charged with homicide uh those people
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
generally get convicted the cases are
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
charged by the Attorney General's office
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
they're generally very strong cases um
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
if they do not serve life without parole
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
The Plea Bargains involved tend to
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
involve decades uh in in prison so as a
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
practical matter if this person is
 
03:51:59.710 --> 03:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
charged with first deegree murder second
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
degree murder um they are going to serve
 
03:52:04.510 --> 03:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
a very long time in prison there's a
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
statute that recognizes that and makes
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
it nearly impossible for them to get out
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
of jail and I think as a system and as a
 
03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
defense attorney I expect that my client
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be held and is probably
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
going to serve a very long sentence so
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
homicide I think is the Apex in terms of
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
danger in terms of risk of flight um in
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the probability of a person um
 
03:52:28.110 --> 03:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
being convicted and serving a very long
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
sentence but many of the offenses here
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's been pointed out that misdemeanor
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is on this list but
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
even other offenses frankly first degree
 
03:52:37.870 --> 03:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
assault many second degree assaults that
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
are on this list they're often resolved
 
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh with no or little incarceration um
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes reduced to misdemeanor
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes they end up being dropped um
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
altogether which is a a devastating
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
consequence uh for a person who is uh
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial potentially more likely
 
03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
to be held due to a
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
presumption and a person who's charged
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to pick on second deegree
 
03:53:04.750 --> 03:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
assault um is not necessarily more
 
03:53:06.750 --> 03:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the alleged victim not
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily more dangerous to the public
 
03:53:11.429 --> 03:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
not necessarily any less amenable to
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
release than a person who's charged with
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
DWI operating after certification as a
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
bital offender or burglary but maybe
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
they are and this is this is what um
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
judges prosecutors and defense attorneys
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
do every day I will assure you that when
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
a person is before a bail commissioner
 
03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
when a person is before a judge that
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
judicial officer that bail commissioner
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely considers the nature of the
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
offense the gersting affidavit um the
 
03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause affidavit that may be
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
before him or her if someone is charged
 
03:53:45.950 --> 03:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
with first degree assault a light bulb
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
goes off if someone is charged with
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
forgery maybe you know maybe there's a
 
03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
more of a presumption of release
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
especially if the person doesn't have a
 
03:53:56.189 --> 03:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
record so I do think this is something
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
that is already very seriously being
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
considered um I do not think that a lot
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
of these uh offenses belong on the same
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
list as as homicide um with respect to
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
offenses against children which are as
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
abhorent and and viewed as as abhorent
 
03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
as homicide and in many respects and for
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
good reasons um currently I will tell
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
you that there are people charged with
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
aggravated fluous sexual assault who are
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
released on bail there are people who
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
are not and the same thing with child
 
03:54:29.630 --> 03:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
pornography and there's a lot that goes
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
into that sort of calculus um maybe the
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
sexual assault occurred a very long time
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
ago maybe it was an isolated incident
 
03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
maybe this person otherwise has baale
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
facts that um make them amenable to
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
release in the community same thing with
 
03:54:46.149 --> 03:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
the so-called child pornography maybe it
 
03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
was one or two images maybe it's an
 
03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
especially young or an especially old
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
person um I think all of these things
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
are taken into consideration already so
 
03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
just in some I I think that that our
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme um already sorts things
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
out appropriately I think that the
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
actors in the scheme um can um make
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
these assessments we're not always going
 
03:55:10.349 --> 03:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
to agree with these assessments and
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's always with bail going to be a
 
03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
story that can be told about something
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
that happened and there's not a lot we
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
can do about that unless we just lock
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
everyone up pre-trial can happen um in
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
any respect um so for those reasons I
 
03:55:26.710 --> 03:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
would uh just offer my comments uh in
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to this list and and this
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
type of segregation based on offense
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.239 --> 03:55:45.429 align:start position:0%
 
Newman

03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as I read it thank you madam
 
03:55:52.830 --> 03:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
chair this bill as I read it um prevents
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner that on on the off
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
hour the off hours of of the
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
Court um the these this list prevents
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
any of
 
03:56:08.149 --> 03:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
these um crimes to be heard by a bail
 
03:56:11.790 --> 03:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner so you no matter how they
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
keep making it smaller and smaller
 
03:56:16.349 --> 03:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger do you do you think do
 
03:56:16.359 --> 03:56:17.149 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger do you do you think do
you

03:56:17.149 --> 03:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:56:21.309 --> 03:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
find um concern about the elimination of
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners before
 
03:56:26.110 --> 03:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
we get something else that will take
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
care of the auth hours like the
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
magistrate bill or the judges I my
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
understanding and again from talking to
 
03:56:34.030 --> 03:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
Professor sh my understanding is that
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
there is and I've read a bit about um a
 
03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
magistrate initiative that is in effect
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
or that is progressing um I've spoken
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
before um about bail Commissioners um
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners have been in our
 
03:56:53.469 --> 03:56:53.479 align:start position:0%
system for a very long time um I I think
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are they're capable
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
of exercising their judgment they're
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
capable of exercising their common sense
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
um and and looking at um the information
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
they have to make the determinations
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
that they make to have off hours that
 
03:57:09.630 --> 03:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
being said I always think that we can do
 
03:57:11.309 --> 03:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
a better job I think judges can do a
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
better job in the federal system when a
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
judge makes a bail to determination he's
 
03:57:16.990 --> 03:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
got a probation officer who wrote a
 
03:57:19.630 --> 03:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
whole report uh to guide him or her in
 
03:57:22.510 --> 03:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
making the decision um so I'm not I'm
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm hitting on on the center of
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
your question um I think that that more
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
training or potentially magistrates is
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
potentially better but I I'm I mean I
 
03:57:38.070 --> 03:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
from my position I have confidence in in
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
in bail Commissioners exercising their
 
03:57:41.950 --> 03:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
discretion with respect to any offense
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:50.189 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
you we hear often in this testimony
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
because this is we've had testimony on
 
03:57:56.830 --> 03:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
bills like this for year for as long as
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
I've been here and and this is my third
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
time around um but there's always a
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
premise that's made that the bail
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
commission that the
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
judges they the bail commissioner don't
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
do as good a job it's judges and more
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
people get released have have have you
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
found that premise that that bail
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners release more people to uh
 
03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
than judges or I what's your opinion on
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I I certainly do not have
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
any sort of numbers my my impression is
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case I mean it would
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
be as as you probably know if you've sat
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
through number of these bills our system
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
is is a great system but it's it's not
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's very deficient in terms of
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
collecting any sort of information I
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if states do I I do not have
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
an impression that bail Commissioners
 
03:58:54.630 --> 03:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
are more permissive in relacing people
 
03:58:57.670 --> 03:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
than um judges are in fact I wouldn't I
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
I think there probably are a number of
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
different types of bail Commissioners in
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the backgrounds they come from
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't be surprised if it were
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
more the opposite where a bail
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to say this is a
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault I don't know very
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
much about the this person um I'm not
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
really liking what I hear about them
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to get a hearing in in a
 
03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
short period of time I'm going to be
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
more cautious and I'm going to I'm going
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
to hold them or I'm going to set a high
 
03:59:24.110 --> 03:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
build I wouldn't be surprised if in
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
other words I wouldn't be surprised if
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
the opposite were in many cases
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
you if if I may ask a question so you
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
had mentioned about isolated incidences
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
and when you had mentioned that you were
 
03:59:43.469 --> 03:59:43.479 align:start position:0%
um talking about um sexual assaults
 
03:59:43.479 --> 03:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
um talking about um sexual assaults
specifically

03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
so if a person has this isolated
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
incident or it may be thought that it is
 
03:59:51.309 --> 03:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
there really isn't a way for New
 
03:59:53.070 --> 03:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to know if it indeed is
 
03:59:56.349 --> 03:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
isolated correct if a well correct I
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
mean if you have a person there's all
 
04:00:01.389 --> 04:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
different you should I should I finish
 
04:00:04.110 --> 04:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
the answer if not then I
 
04:00:06.750 --> 04:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
won't you can but that was why just want
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
to know that there's there's not really
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
a way to know if you're right I mean
 
04:00:12.429 --> 04:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
there's all different types of charging
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
right there are different type oh okay
 
04:00:20.590 --> 04:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I'm sorry there are
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
different types of charging decisions
 
04:00:23.309 --> 04:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
that are made and they're made after
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
careful investigation typically there's
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
a Child Advocacy Center interview that's
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
done a forensic interview where a child
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
is interviewed um there are detectives
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
involved who have specialized training
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
so there's an effort if somebody if
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is charged with a single kind
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault there is an effort to
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
determine in from a from an
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
investigative perspective and aeren
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
forensic interviewing perspective what
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
you have do you have a person who
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
committed an isolated incident do you
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
have a pattern of sexual assault where
 
04:00:54.670 --> 04:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
you have a girl who's been groomed and
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted for years do you have
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
multiple victims this is something that
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
I I think investigators are always
 
04:01:02.110 --> 04:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
looking at and I think they're getting
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
better and better at at at doing it um
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
and when they bring a case before the
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
court sometimes there's one indictment
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's 50
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
indictments that that presumably is
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to make a difference in in in in
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
baale I would
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
you afternoon everybody uh for the
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is Albert Sher uh I'm a
 
04:01:42.670 --> 04:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
law professor at uh Franklin Pi Law
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
Center and a Police Commissioner in
 
04:01:48.030 --> 04:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh what I say here today is
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
my opinion only not that of either UNH
 
04:01:54.510 --> 04:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
or the Portsmouth police commission
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
um I I know this committee spent
 
04:01:59.550 --> 04:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and much of the committee
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
spent three months last fall going
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
through um all the permutations of bail
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
and trying to put in place Common Sense
 
04:02:13.149 --> 04:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
practical uh changes that address the
 
04:02:16.110 --> 04:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
concerns of all the stakeholders who
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
came in front of the the committee and
 
04:02:20.189 --> 04:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
in fact all the stakeholders came in
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
front of the committee and um came up
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
with a package of bills that are making
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
their right
 
04:02:31.030 --> 04:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh all of them have made it through the
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
the house the substance of the bills uh
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
I think a couple of them are in house
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
finance my understanding they're going
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
to make their way through house finance
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
relatively shortly and head to the
 
04:02:41.279 --> 04:02:42.830 align:start position:0%
relatively shortly and head to the
Senate

04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
um I I think the danger from now on in
 
04:02:50.429 --> 04:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
the package that uh this committee put
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
together after a lot of work is that one
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislature legislator or another is
 
04:03:00.830 --> 04:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to see a thread that they think
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
they can improve if they pull that
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
thread and put another one in they can
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
make the package that this committee so
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
carefully put together over three months
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
of hearings they can make it better
 
04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
um and I think this committee knows as
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
better than anyone now once you start
 
04:03:22.269 --> 04:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
pulling those
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
threads um the whole thing might unravel
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know there were
 
04:03:31.389 --> 04:03:31.399 align:start position:0%
everybody who testified prosecutors the
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs uh the public defender
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
program uh myself uh many other
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh bail
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um every body recognized
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that what this committee came up with
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
involved a set of compromises on
 
04:03:50.880 --> 04:03:52.110 align:start position:0%
involved a set of compromises on
everybody's

04:03:52.110 --> 04:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
part you know uh and uh I think thread
 
04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
pulling is the biggest danger to
 
04:04:01.389 --> 04:04:01.399 align:start position:0%
something that was carefully crafted and
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
pulling one thread May unravel the whole
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
thing um you know I was and
 
04:04:11.469 --> 04:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
and I think this committee will
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
understand the significance of what I'm
 
04:04:15.550 --> 04:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
about to say say you know I'm in support
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
of this compromise and when I was in
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
house finance last week the executive
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
director of the police Chiefs
 
04:04:24.670 --> 04:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
Association got up and said that the
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs Association was in
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
wholehearted support of the compromise
 
04:04:35.149 --> 04:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
what I call the Grand bargain um so I
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't you know you can quibble this way
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
or that way whether Senator ab's Bill
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
improves something that matters to him I
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it does I think everything
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
that is in his bill is in uh the
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
compromise Bill and more I think it's
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
better um than this is and so I really
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that this committee
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
interim study Senator ais's Bill and if
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
for some reason Things Fall Apart in the
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
Senate uh then we can pull Senator
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
avis's Bill back if need be and address
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
it but um let's
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
let's not be distracted by a particular
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
thread that one legislator or another
 
04:05:20.159 --> 04:05:23.309 align:start position:0%
thread that one legislator or another
doesn't

04:05:23.309 --> 04:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
like thank you attorney representative
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:05:33.229 --> 04:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
question this compromise that you speak
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
of that's on its way um does it does
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
this solve the problem that occurs when
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
you take bail Commissioners away or is
 
04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
there something something would the bail
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
commission is remain in the interim or
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
or would there be a blank now because
 
04:05:53.189 --> 04:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
like this bill that they would also take
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
away the bail Commissioners so um to
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
great question and captures the
 
04:06:04.590 --> 04:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
multi-layered approach of the grand
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
bargain the compromise
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
Bill compromise bill says identifies 12
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
crimes they're all felonies a little
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
different than what's in Senator avis's
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
Bill but and it says uh they will be
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
held without seeing a bail
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner but they must see a
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
magistrate within 24 hours or a judge
 
04:06:31.269 --> 04:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours okay it doesn't the
 
04:06:33.790 --> 04:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
compromise as a whole does not get rid
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
of bail Commissioners I know
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative site believes differently
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't get rid of bail
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in fact it raises the pay
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
of bail Commissioners and in fact it
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
requires that if the the defendant can't
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
pay the bail commissioner that the state
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
pays the bail commissioner so we do
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
better by bail Commissioners in the
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
compromise Bill than anyone has done for
 
04:07:03.030 --> 04:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
all the years that I've been and some of
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
you on this committee know how many
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
years that is all the years that I've
 
04:07:07.870 --> 04:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
been involved working with this
 
04:07:09.870 --> 04:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
committee and other committees on bail
 
04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
so uh I I want to get rid of the
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that the the
 
04:07:18.910 --> 04:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
compromise gets rid of bail
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on on certain crimes it
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
says it meets the needs
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
of police
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
departments who said during all the
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
hearings last year we don't like these
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
serious crimes going to bail
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because we don't trust
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
them and that's one of the reasons that
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
we put in place the the Magistrate
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh system a host of other reasons um so
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh it it takes care of that problem
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else that is here
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
that would like to testify on Senate
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%

04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
card see none I will close the public

plastow

04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
plastow
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm introducing this on behalf of
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon uh what this does it
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
creates a mandatory minim minimum
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
sentence for someone uh who distributes
 
04:09:29.950 --> 04:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or fentanyl class drug to
 
04:09:32.109 --> 04:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
someone and it causes their death it's a
 
04:09:34.990 --> 04:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
10-year mandatory minimum sentence uh
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
and they could actually serve up to a
 
04:09:36.439 --> 04:09:38.790 align:start position:0%
and they could actually serve up to a
life

04:09:38.790 --> 04:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
imprisonment that's what the bill does
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.479 --> 04:09:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.550 --> 04:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you for taking my question
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that um
 
04:10:02.670 --> 04:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
this penalty increase would make
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
overdose I couldn't speak on whether
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to overdose because
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
a synthetic drug like fentol is Con
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
constantly changing and being disguised
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
on the drugs but when it comes to
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
Distributing the drugs and you're going
 
04:10:20.349 --> 04:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
to hand it to someone else and it's
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
going to kill someone I think someone
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
would be less likely to do that to know
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
that if they did that and it resulted in
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
a death because they're giving someone a
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
drug that has a high frequency of people
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
overdosing and dying they're going to
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
face a mandatory minimum of 10 years in
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
jail that's that's the best case
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
scenario so I think they would be less
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
people willing to take the risk of
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
Distributing it and I don't believe this
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
would really come up very often when you
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
have two addicts doing hand to hands
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves because and I'm sure
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
someone with law enforcement experience
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
could explain this better than I can but
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
generally it's hard to prove who gave
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
what to who when it's in that isolated
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
confession followup thank you um so it
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
then I take it it's your impression that
 
04:11:07.510 --> 04:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
a mandatory minimum
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be known by people
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
Distributing drugs
 
04:11:16.830 --> 04:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
and um they would be less likely to
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
distribute them I just trying to make
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
sense of how a mandatory minimum changes
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
Behavior over what we have today
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
considering that today there is a
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
penalty someone dies you are facing jail
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
time what does more jail time do to that
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
um mathematical situation well number
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
one they killed someone they did
 
04:11:40.590 --> 04:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
something that they know could likely
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
cause the death of someone and then in
 
04:11:44.910 --> 04:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
fact fact results in the death of
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
someone is it an intentional kill are
 
04:11:50.030 --> 04:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
they intentionally killing the person I
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to go that far but
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
they're they're giving someone an
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
illegal synthetic drug that they know
 
04:11:58.229 --> 04:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
has a high propensity to lead to death
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
and they did it so perhaps what will
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
they know that they're going to face a
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence I'm not I can't speak
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
to what a drug dealer would know but I'm
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
sure after the first person gets a
 
04:12:11.149 --> 04:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence it will be well known
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
within the criminal underworld and
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's something that would
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have people dying over 400 people
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
died of drug overdoses 80% of those were
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and if you're going to give
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
that drug to someone and it's going to
 
04:12:26.000 --> 04:12:26.910 align:start position:0%
that drug to someone and it's going to
kill

04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
kill
 
04:12:29.550 --> 04:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
someone at this point I don't see why
 
04:12:34.109 --> 04:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
gther thank you for taking my question
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
so is this bill supposed to be for the
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
dealer or is this bill directed towards
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
um people that do drugs together it's
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
anyone who distributes the
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
drug that's what who would apply to now
 
04:12:58.349 --> 04:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
could it apply to two drug addicts who
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
are you know living in an apartment
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
together technically it can in those
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
scenarios I will say it's extremely
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove Who had who had what
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
first especially when the other person's
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
dead so although it could be prosecuted
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
that way that's not the likely scenario
 
04:13:19.389 --> 04:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
but when you're dealing with someone
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
who's Distributing drugs and selling
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
them and that results in a death that's
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
what this is targeting I I also point
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
out that when it comes to law
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement getting
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
informance well someone facing 10 years
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
on their head they may uh that that's
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
how that's how this works from the
 
04:13:39.000 --> 04:13:42.030 align:start position:0%
how that's how this works from the
ground

04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.040 --> 04:13:44.269 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:13:44.279 --> 04:13:45.950 align:start position:0%
up
representative

04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question given that
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
fenel is ubiquitous um that it is
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
basically in everything and that we have
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
um thus far not past um testing and
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
analyzing comprehensive testing and anal
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
analyzing um capabilities how would you
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
um demonstrate that someone actually
 
04:14:12.510 --> 04:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
knew what was in there and the amount
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
that was in what they were giving to
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
someone so demonstrating intent in any
 
04:14:21.109 --> 04:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
way well it's the intent would apply to
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
them Distributing it now they're trying
 
04:14:24.189 --> 04:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
to distribute a drug if you have what
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
you think is cocaine and it turns out to
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
be heroin the intent elements satisfied
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
because you're intending to distribute
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
said control substance that you believe
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
is a a drug that's a controlled
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
substance what the person's doing is
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
still illegal the fact that they didn't
 
04:14:40.030 --> 04:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
know how much fentanyl is in there I
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
mean we do have testing strips we did
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
pass that law but with that being said
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
they're Distributing drugs we're talking
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
about someone who's dealing drugs that
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
are killing people and that's what we're
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
worried about here if someone says oh I
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't know how much was in
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
there well it's it's a synthetic drug
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it includes the mixing
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
agent so the reason why people overdose
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
is that it's very difficult to tell how
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
much is in there based on its potency so
 
04:15:08.349 --> 04:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and that's why we
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
want to really make a statement that you
 
04:15:12.429 --> 04:15:12.439 align:start position:0%
need to stop dealing this because people
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
are dying because exactly what you said
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they're
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
doing can I just follow up really
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
quickly so is the intention
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
to save lives or is it to make a
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
statement well it's to save lives by
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
people who are doing this and it results
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the death of someone now they're in
 
04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
jail that's one person engaging in
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
Behavior that's plaguing our society
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's now off the street so it's when
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
we say we make a statement what we're
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
trying to explain to the criminal
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
underworld and the people who are doing
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
things that they know will kill people
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
and people who are sick and I've lost
 
04:15:53.109 --> 04:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
good friends to drug overdoses so I'm
 
04:15:55.469 --> 04:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
not someone who's not and I'm sure a lot
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
of people can relate to that I mean one
 
04:15:59.309 --> 04:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
of my best friends that I lived with her
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
five years in college died of fentanyl
 
04:16:03.550 --> 04:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
all right he was an attorney just like
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know so no one no one's exempt here
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
but the person who gave him that
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
fentanyl I wish what they really did was
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
ask them to go to rehab or had them call
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
me but that's not what happened they
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
gave him a drug and now he's dead my
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
other friend who died his wake I
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
remember his wake was on was on the day
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
that his fiance's due date was for their
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
unborn child I wish same scenario I wish
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
that drug dealer rather than give him a
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
drug did something different and all
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
that person is going to get is a
 
04:16:33.000 --> 04:16:34.830 align:start position:0%
that person is going to get is a
distribution

04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
charge I'm going to refrain from I think
 
04:16:39.389 --> 04:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
they I think they belong in jail thank
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um I don't
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
know off the top of my head so maybe you
 
04:16:48.429 --> 04:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
can enlighten me if we're talking about
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
you know the intent not being death it's
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
like manslaughter right and I was just
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a mandatory minimum
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
for manslaughter and is that 10 years I
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe I don't know the mandatory
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
up the top of my head it's um I don't
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
10 no
 
04:17:07.800 --> 04:17:09.349 align:start position:0%
10 no
mandatory

04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
oh I'll take I'll take professor she at
 
04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
his word who's not here on behalf of any
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
academic institution
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
right but
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
but with that being said this is a
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
little different than manslaughter
 
04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
because I I would put this one step
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
above because you're
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
engaging in some in Behavior where you
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
really know that that there's a a
 
04:17:35.710 --> 04:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood or at least a a possibility
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
of a harm happening and then when that
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
harm happens it's kind of hard to say
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
well I didn't mean for that to happen I
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's common knowledge even
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
amongst addicts about the high overdose
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
rat a lot of drug addicts will not do
 
04:17:49.950 --> 04:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
drugs alone at least they try to avoid
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
doing that in case one of them
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
overdoses and that's why we passed the a
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
law um where if you're with someone who
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
overdoses and you bring them to the ER
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
that that person has immunity so we're
 
04:18:03.109 --> 04:18:03.119 align:start position:0%
trying to save as many lives as possible
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
on every end of this but one of the ways
 
04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
of doing that is to for the people who
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
are Distributing this there needs to be
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
penalties for it especially when they it
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
results in de I I certainly would be
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
Muse so as as I look at the statute a
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
judge currently has the ability to
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
actually sentence somebody who does this
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
to life in prison right
 
04:18:34.800 --> 04:18:36.389 align:start position:0%
to life in prison right
now

04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to know is what
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
evidence you have that attacking a
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum onto a crime that
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
already provides the potential for a
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
life sentence does uh in terms of
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
messaging I guess number one uh what
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
message aren't people getting by the
 
04:18:59.870 --> 04:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
fact that the current statute has a life
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
sentence uh tacked onto it and the other
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
thing uh the other thing I'm curious
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
about also one of a Time representative
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
Muse please okay okay I represented
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
people facing a mandatory T to to life
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
trust me it weighs on them very much and
 
04:19:19.149 --> 04:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
very first of all that's that's a heavy
 
04:19:23.469 --> 04:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
way for them to be carrying and it's
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
obviously a serious offense and it's one
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
of those instances where when that's out
 
04:19:30.990 --> 04:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
there it really puts a stamp on what's
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
Happening when the it's a possibility
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
this a possibility there's a lot of
 
04:19:36.510 --> 04:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
mitigating circumstances perhaps can
 
04:19:39.790 --> 04:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
come up uh what we're saying is when
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's a mandatory sentence like this um
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a stiff penalty and is
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
it going to deter all this Behavior no
 
04:19:49.630 --> 04:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
but it it's certainly I think a step in
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
the right
 
04:19:53.790 --> 04:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
direction followup represent followup
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and and and I guess the other thing
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm curious about is is what is the
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
case that instituting a 10-year
 
04:20:03.030 --> 04:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum is actually going to
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
have any impact at all I mean have we
 
04:20:08.309 --> 04:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
seen uh I know other states have been
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
approaching uh this issue in a similar
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
way have we started to see that those
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
states are actually getting better
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
results by doing this I'm not familiar
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
with how many other states have done it
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
because I think the first of all when it
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
comes to debts there's a lot of some
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
states are not doing their you know as
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
good of a job with Naran so some of the
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
numbers can be skewed in different
 
04:20:33.550 --> 04:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
directions I think we've done our First
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
Responders have done an amazing job of
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
saving lives which is you know which is
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
unbelievably and they deserve a round of
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
applause but that also mitigates the
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
number down to where it doesn't look
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
like it's as much of a problem as it
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
still is so I think what we're trying to
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
deal with is the people who are
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
Distributing that drug uh this is how
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
you bring down these Enterprises where
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
they stop dealing the drugs that can
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
kill you from an overdose maybe they'll
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
stop lacing it into street level drugs
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
like LSD or or cannabis maybe they'll
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
stop doing that knowing that they're
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to face a mandatory
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
sentence that's what's happening is that
 
04:21:10.910 --> 04:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is getting mixed into cocaine
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's getting mixed into heroin it's get
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
mix in other stuff and they're not even
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
telling the person that they're selling
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
it to that it's in there and then the
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
person's dying so as bad as it is to be
 
04:21:24.030 --> 04:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
selling those other drugs mixing another
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
deadly drug in
 
04:21:28.269 --> 04:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
there as a because it's less expensive
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the as a cutting
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
agent is is problematic and that's
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
what's causing a lot of these deaths so
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deter that behavior if
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
you don't think a mandatory sentence
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
deters the behavior I'm not sure why we
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
followup representative Muse we would
 
04:21:49.389 --> 04:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
would you be okay if we came back to
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
that if it doesn't get answered because
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have I think four other people that
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
still have it's an immediate kind of a
 
04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
thing if you don't mind okay real quick
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
um um I'm I'm all said thank you I I
 
04:22:05.550 --> 04:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
understand you don't prefer the
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory result but mandatory sentence
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
but if that if you don't think that's
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
the solution I are we interested in
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
hearing what what the solution is I
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
think it's a collective effort of
 
04:22:17.830 --> 04:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
penalties strong mandatory sentences
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
also uh drug treatment mental health
 
04:22:20.670 --> 04:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
treatment on the other side of it I
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a really you want to take
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
every angle possible and this is one of
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.830 --> 04:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
angles so just before I continue to go
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
down my list I just want you guys to
 
04:22:31.309 --> 04:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
know I do see your hands and I'm I'm
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
writing them down and before we go back
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
around the room I'm trying to get
 
04:22:36.109 --> 04:22:36.119 align:start position:0%
everybody that had their hand up before
 
04:22:38.349 --> 04:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
we go back for our second round uh
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you madam
 
04:22:41.309 --> 04:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
question senator in your experience do
 
04:22:45.950 --> 04:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
we have drug dealers out there still
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
making uh rules of money off people's
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering by trafficking
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
narcotics that they particularly may not
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
indulge in
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
themselves that's what's happening some
 
04:22:59.469 --> 04:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
some use it in themselves some don't but
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
but they not only is it C causing pain
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and suffering it's causing people to
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
you representative celik thank you very
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
much um in uh and thank you particular
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
my question in line 12 U or 11 and 12 it
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
says that it it's if the death was not
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
um too remote in its occurrence as to
 
04:23:22.510 --> 04:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
have just bearing on the person's
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
liability I was hoping you could clarify
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
what you what you mean by that or what
 
04:23:30.189 --> 04:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
the bill means by that so my
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that's the ex that's the
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
existing law but I think sometimes when
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
someone takes a drug if they were to
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
let's say die the next day of let's say
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
like a heart attack it's much harder to
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
link it link that to it now could could
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
have contributed to their
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
death perhaps but that's really
 
04:23:50.109 --> 04:23:50.119 align:start position:0%
something that a medical um expert would
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
bden um a few years ago I remember um it
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
was bipartisan legislation was passed
 
04:24:11.109 --> 04:24:11.119 align:start position:0%
into law to um
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
forgive or or Overlook um the charge of
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
possession when someone makes a 911
 
04:24:21.109 --> 04:24:21.119 align:start position:0%
called report an
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
overdose um but that only applies to the
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
charge possession and not with intent to
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
distribute and as I said that
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
was I think unanimously I think it
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
passed on consent and uh was a Voice
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
vote in the Senate and um so I'm curious
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
how a mandatory minimum on this sort of
 
04:24:45.070 --> 04:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
penalty interplays with the
 
04:24:48.269 --> 04:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
decision-making process when maybe
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
someone who supplied someone with a drug
 
04:24:54.429 --> 04:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
that they're overdosing on is faced with
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
the option of leave and let them die or
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
call 911 and help them knowing that
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
maybe they would be spared the charge of
 
04:25:05.469 --> 04:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
possession but could spend 10 years
 
04:25:08.910 --> 04:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
behind bars what do you think that um
 
04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
what decision do you think people would
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
make in that situation and how do you
 
04:25:12.520 --> 04:25:13.750 align:start position:0%
make in that situation and how do you
think

04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
it would play out as far as overdose
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
death rates in New
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh I would have be speculating
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
on what people are thinking at the time
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
that when they gave someone a drug and
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
then watching the person die right in
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
front of them how they would handle it I
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
would hope that they would take that
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
person to the hospital or at least make
 
04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
an anonymous call or do whatever use
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
that the other person's just do
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
something rather than leaving them there
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
to die could that happen I good friend
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
of mine sister that happened to
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh she overdosed the person with her did
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
nothing and she died in that person's
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
apartment you know I I I don't know how
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
those people can live with themselves
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
but that's what they're doing uh with
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
that being said again if that if someone
 
04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
were to overdose it's very hard for law
 
04:26:01.229 --> 04:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement and keep in mind the burden
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
of proof for a conviction Beyond A
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt to De demonstrate who
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
gave what to who first if you have two
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
people using drugs you know in an
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
isolated area at for all you you for all
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
they know the person who overdose is the
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
one who supplied the drug they don't
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
know that absent a confession so it's
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
unusual for that to happen but they
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
would have immunity I think just to the
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
POS potential of the possession charge I
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say immunity any I I believe
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's I'm going top of my head but any
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
evidence they get during that process
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
where they reported it the overdose have
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
brought them to the hospital that would
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
be um they couldn't use any of that
 
04:26:37.760 --> 04:26:41.229 align:start position:0%
be um they couldn't use any of that
evidence

04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.239 --> 04:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
obtained

04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
obtained
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
follow thank you
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
um in my experience and I think it's
 
04:26:49.319 --> 04:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
um in my experience and I think it's
limited

04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not seeing a lot of people in New
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with a substance abuse
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
issue that also have a
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
JD um so if they don't know about burden
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
of proof they haven't been educated in
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
that they don't know the exact wording
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the law is there a possibility that
 
04:27:12.990 --> 04:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
hearing about a mandatory minimum would
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
adversely impact the likelihood that
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
someone would call 911 potentially
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
resulting in unsolved um you know
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
situations where there's I remember
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
hearing from a republican um a
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
republican lawmaker who was an EMT about
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
finding um you know bodies in the snow
 
04:27:37.030 --> 04:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
bank outside of the ER and hearing from
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
police officers about getting a call to
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
a location for an overdose and finding a
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
dead body and driver's license in the
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
scene of being cleaned and so like
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
looking back on those situations that
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
occurred that resulted in creating the
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
immunity law that we have in
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
place I guess I'm just
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
wondering is it possible that the
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
unforeseen consequence of this
 
04:28:01.630 --> 04:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
legislation as proposed would cause more
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths as opposed to reversed
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
overdoses and would it cause more
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths with no evidence at the
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
scene instead of someone calling 911 one
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
getting someone help and being present
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
and cooperating with
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
police I would have no way of answering
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
that accurately because I have no
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to no study or information to
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
base that on I would certainly hope not
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
because that's clearly not the intent of
 
04:28:32.189 --> 04:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is to cause more deaths I I I
 
04:28:35.670 --> 04:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
always lean back on if there's no one
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
selling fentanyl no one's going to
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
overdose from It ultimately I understand
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
you got to treat people who are addicted
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
you got deal with the mental health side
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
of things there's a lot of pieces here
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
but if no one sold it and no one
 
04:28:50.429 --> 04:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
distributed it that solves your fentanyl
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
problem that's where it all starts so I
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
think we got to be mindful of that and
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
for the people that are going to be
 
04:28:58.349 --> 04:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
Distributing it I think that we got to
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
keep make this a mandatory sentence do
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
people will people not report
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
Newman I have just a question on on the
 
04:29:18.750 --> 04:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
wording of the bill because I've heard
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
testimony about dealers selling we've
 
04:29:24.429 --> 04:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
got to stop that kind of thing and it
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
looks like in the bill we've made two
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
changes that are that kind of make it
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
man make it be what it is and it change
 
04:29:35.469 --> 04:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
May to shall so there used to be
 
04:29:35.479 --> 04:29:36.910 align:start position:0%
May to shall so there used to be
judicial

04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
04:29:39.950 --> 04:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
discretion on and the judge was was able
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
to do have judicial discretion
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
and then it it says and maybe you can
 
04:29:47.710 --> 04:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
explain this to me because I'm not sure
 
04:29:50.189 --> 04:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
I understand the phrase correctly
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
strictly liable so does that mean that
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be selling it they
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
could just be giving
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
sharing the the uh the drug with someone
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
and then someone dies and then they are
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
subject to this mandatory minimum so
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
distri thank you for the question
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
distribution does not necessarily
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
require an exchange of consideration so
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to just hand it to people as
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
a gift that's that's a form of
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
distribution which can just as likely
 
04:30:22.990 --> 04:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
kill someone as the person selling
 
04:30:23.000 --> 04:30:25.429 align:start position:0%
kill someone as the person selling
it

04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
followup followup okay
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
so is is there something in here that
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
says distribution is is required I all I
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
see is strictly liable for a death well
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
I'm using the the term distribution but
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
it says manufact existing laws
 
04:30:45.149 --> 04:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer sells or
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
dispenses so it's talking about when
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
what happens when you that I'm just kind
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
of summing up in a general term is
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
distribution yeah I didn't see that but
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
it all it's all connected so when
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it only for someone to
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
sell it only for someone to then
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
dispense it that that's what's happening
 
04:31:03.159 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
dispense it that that's what's happening
thank

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
you representative her G are you good um
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
yes and no so thank you for taking my
 
04:31:11.439 --> 04:31:12.510 align:start position:0%
yes and no so thank you for taking my
question

04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
um so if this bill was to pass um would
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
you agree that this bill takes away the
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judicial of the
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
judges uh when it comes to applying the
 
04:31:24.750 --> 04:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence it does limit the
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
discretion because there obviously it's
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
a mandatory sentence but the judge would
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to sentence that
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
person beyond what the mandatory is up
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
sentence why do you say
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
that so someone who's convicted under
 
04:31:45.870 --> 04:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
this yeah it's a mandatory 10 up to a
 
04:31:47.710 --> 04:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
life they the judge could sentence them
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
to say 15 years or 12 years you know all
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
right that that would be within a
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion but not less sorry
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
but not less than correct hold on a
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
minute correct okay thank you
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you madam
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
chairman this is a little bit off but
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
relevant nonetheless we're losing a lot
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
of lives def fent all overdoses do you
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
think shutting down the Border would cut
 
04:32:15.109 --> 04:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
off the supply as well and perhaps
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that we should address
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I wish we could address that
 
04:32:22.469 --> 04:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
at the state level I I think a lot of
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
the the illegal fentanyl comes into this
 
04:32:26.109 --> 04:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
country it's coming in through the
 
04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
southern border there's also fentanyl
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
coming in through the northern border uh
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
would that stop this problem
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
instantaneously it it would certainly
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
help because you get rid of the
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
supply well that's a big part of it if
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's no Supply you know supply and
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
Senator with
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
this we have a lot of bills that have to
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
do with fentanyl we're hearing it
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
Non-Stop and we keep on using or hearing
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
the term of harm reduction do you think
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
this would be a tool along with the harm
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
reduction if the people are not able or
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
at least know that there's going to be a
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
serious consequence to destroying
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
families destroying communities the
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
state the country as a whole absolutely
 
04:33:10.990 --> 04:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
the worst harm you can cause is death I
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
that literally killing someone is the
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
worst thing you can do and when you if
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
the people who are causing the death of
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
other people are no longer um able to do
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
that at least they're they're
 
04:33:23.789 --> 04:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I think that that's that
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
will ultimately lead to harm reduction
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
because if they sell it to me they'll
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.629 --> 04:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:33:33.639 --> 04:33:36.949 align:start position:0%
you representative
Pratt

04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
hello old friend old friend here to Yes
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh could this be called a benefit versus
 
04:33:44.080 --> 04:33:44.910 align:start position:0%
uh could this be called a benefit versus
risk

04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
Bill where a drug dealer is willing to
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
risk another person's life to make a
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
profit well I think the drug dealers are
 
04:33:55.470 --> 04:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
doing that now so they're already doing
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
that and this is trying to stop and they
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think that they're aware that what
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing could cause the death of
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
someone and they may sell someone drugs
 
04:34:04.830 --> 04:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
and then you know knowing that that
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
person may share with you know amongst
 
04:34:09.869 --> 04:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
their their other you know friends or
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
whatever and they're doing it anyway so
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow up follow up um so this
 
04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
is basically trying to modify a deal as
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
Reckless Behavior in the results of a
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
death of another person I would call it
 
04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
intentional Behavior but
 
04:34:29.551 --> 04:34:29.561 align:start position:0%
yes representative nman do you have a
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
followup yes I just have a followup to
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
on once I found the word cell I went
 
04:34:37.310 --> 04:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
back and read again and if you look on
 
04:34:37.320 --> 04:34:38.230 align:start position:0%
back and read again and if you look on
line

04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
four it says all that above and then it
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
says or is strictly liable for a death
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
so does that still include the sale when
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
it says or or or do I have to rely
 
04:34:53.789 --> 04:34:53.799 align:start position:0%
strictly on the on the definition of
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
strictly liable but thank you for the qu
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
question I think what you're asking me
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
is the existing law but when you say
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're strictly liable whether
 
04:35:03.629 --> 04:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of which one you did it if
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
you're handing it out you're giving it
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
out you're selling it you're trading it
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know what you know for a sandwich
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you're doing what
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you're doing if you're
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
the one that's putting it out there into
 
04:35:15.789 --> 04:35:15.799 align:start position:0%
Commerce that's includes manufacturing
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you're doing uh yes you
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
are liable whether you intended to kill
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
someone or not they're saying based on
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that you did something that
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
caused the death of someone where it it
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
is clearly should be on the person's
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
radar be shocked to find a single person
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
um that's an adult that would actually
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
believe that fentanyl isn't killing
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
people or could not kill someone thank
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
you and if you know how small of amount
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl it is to kill someone yes I
 
04:35:43.230 --> 04:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
do we'll find that on the on the next
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
bill two two milligrams I
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
believe Senator I I think that we
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
stirred this soup enough we're going to
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
go ahead and let you off the hook now
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%

so many Pathways to Recovery available

we guide individuals in finding the

pathway that feels most most aligned

with their values and needs prior to
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%

Shield New Hampshire is currently
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
grapping grappling with a severe
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
addiction crisis largely fueled by the
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
widespread availability of opioids such
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
as Fentanyl and its
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
analoges however the proposed
 
04:37:42.510 --> 04:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
legislation both SB 414 and 4 15 if
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
enacted would inflict further harm upon
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
those already suffering the most from
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
this epidemic individuals struggling
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
with opioid addiction and other subance
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
use disorders it would lead to the
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration of citizens who do not
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
pose a threat to our state but are
 
04:38:01.949 --> 04:38:01.959 align:start position:0%
instead in dire need of support and
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
treatment for their subance use
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
disorders rather than spending
 
04:38:06.240 --> 04:38:07.590 align:start position:0%
disorders rather than spending
approximately

04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
$68,000 per citizen per year to
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
incarcerate the individuals I question
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't allocate these tax
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
dollars toward evidence-based prevention
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
treatment harm reduction and Recovery
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
initiatives s SP 414 would inadvertently
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
contribute to an increase in overdoses
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
and related fatalities individuals
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
associated with those using these
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
substances will naturally hesitate to be
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
present during drug drug consumption if
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
they fear legal repercussions
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
administering the lock Zone brand named
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
Nan is impossible while the user is
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
unconscious further heightening the risk
 
04:38:52.590 --> 04:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
of fatal
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses it's instructive to note that
 
04:38:57.390 --> 04:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has made significant
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
strides and reducing its overdose death
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
rate which has declined to
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
13.3 for 1,000 citizens in
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
2021 after being the third worst state
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
in the United States for overdose deaths
 
04:39:11.119 --> 04:39:12.789 align:start position:0%
in the United States for overdose deaths
in

04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
2016 I do not believe the intent of this
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is to fill our jails and
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
prisons with some of the most vulnerable
 
04:39:25.709 --> 04:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
citizens yet if these bills are passed
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
that is precisely what will happen
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
instead I urge this committee to Target
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
the dealers and suppliers responsible
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
for trafficking illegal
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
narcotics specifically I propose
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the Quant
 
04:39:45.788 --> 04:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl specified incate Bill 414 to
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
at least 28 gr it should be noted that
 
04:39:49.920 --> 04:39:50.990 align:start position:0%
at least 28 gr it should be noted that
many

04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:39:54.190 --> 04:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
users of fentanyl average four to five
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
grams per
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
day I also would implore the committee
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
eliminating mandatory minimum s
 
04:40:08.590 --> 04:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
sentences without judicial
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
discretion we must focus on holding
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
those primarily responsible for the
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
addiction epidemic
 
04:40:17.070 --> 04:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
accountable without needlessly
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the rate of incarceration for
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
those desperate in need of assistance
 
04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's crucial to recall the failure of
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentencing laws for
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
drug possession which began during the
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
crack cocaine epidemic of the
 
04:40:34.750 --> 04:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
1980s the incarceration rate in the US
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
surged from 100 per 100,000 in
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
1972 to 760 for 100,000 in 2008 with
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
minimal impact on patient
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
safety I implore the legislature to take
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
prompt action to amend the quantity of
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and its analoges and
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
sp415 and to abolish mandatory minimum
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
sentencing let us also prioritize
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
allocating funds to support
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and effective addiction
 
04:41:06.430 --> 04:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
treatment which has been proven to
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate the impact of addiction and
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you madam chair
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
I really want to kind of drill down a
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
little bit on what we're talking about
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
when we say dealers I think people um
 
04:41:28.750 --> 04:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
are referring to to uh something beyond
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
the scope of what this would uh actually
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
entail so for example you were saying
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
the average user I think you said 46
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
milligrams but I didn't write it down
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
right away so right I said the average
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
some average users some users Aver
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
average 45 Mig of fentanyl per day yes
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so my My ultimate question is um in
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
your experience working with people who
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
are uh struggling with substance use um
 
04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
is it common for someone who is in the
 
04:41:59.470 --> 04:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
midst of that um to uh to sell to
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
support their own
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
habit um I mean anecdotally um that
 
04:42:06.670 --> 04:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
happens on occasion but typically the
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
folks that we work with our participants
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
are the are the users they're not
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you madam
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman what
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
how what um do most substance use misus
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
people how do they support their habit
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
how do most of these people afford their
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
their addiction thank you yeah I think
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
it would be speculation for me to say
 
04:42:43.470 --> 04:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
anything to ative certainly um some
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
people are employed um some people um
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
have their own financial means to do so
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and it varies widely from Individual
 
04:42:53.280 --> 04:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
um and it varies widely from Individual
to

04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
individual representative
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
Pratt uh thank you for coming today I'm
 
04:43:04.590 --> 04:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
asking a question about the number you
 
04:43:06.510 --> 04:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
through our a minute ago about the 13
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
per thousand what was that number the um
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
you talking about the incarceration rate
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
no I think you were talking about the
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
drug overdose rate has dropped down 13
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
out of a thousand which is an acceptable
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
rate I said the uh drug overd the drug
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
overdose rate per 1,000 has dropped to
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
32.3 individuals as of
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
2021 the number was much higher in 2016
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire had the third worst
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
weight third worst um overdose rate of
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
deaths in the United States if you
 
04:43:40.680 --> 04:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
deaths in the United States if you
divide

04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
divide
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
a population of 1.3 million people by a
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
thousand that would be like over
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
18,000 overdoses a
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
year uh 30 to do the quick quick math
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
now would be
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
um three I don't have to have an exact
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
number I just we're talking thousands or
 
04:44:03.550 --> 04:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of overdoses is
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
that acceptable level yeah I I can go
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at the attribution but um
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
those are the facts as
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
we gathered them thank you sure
 
04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you madam
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
question in your experience do a lot of
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
these individuals that are street level
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
users do they commit other crimes to
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
finance their
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
habit um again where I come from in
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
Milford we don't see um actually much
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
crime associated with that that might
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
occur in other areas but um we're not uh
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
we don't see a lot of it does it does it
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
happen for sure it does thank you
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative sik thank you and thank
 
04:44:46.830 --> 04:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm wondering
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
do you see any potential to this to
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
being for harm reduction or do you think
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
that those efforts are better spent
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere from this legislation for harm
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
reduction um I don't see this
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislation as engendering harm
 
04:45:01.310 --> 04:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
reduction really at all I think there's
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
other efforts that would be much better
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
reduction see no more questions thank
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
Anderson hello my name is Lucy Anderson
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the time to
 
04:45:38.110 --> 04:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
speak as a community member person in
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
recovery from substance use disorder and
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
employee of SOS recovery Community
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
organization I appreciate the
 
04:45:47.310 --> 04:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to submit testimony and
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
opposition to both Bill 414 and
 
04:45:55.470 --> 04:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
4:15 3 years ago to the week my best
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
friend died of an overdose he was smart
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
and kind and resilient and a valuable
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
member of his community I tell you this
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
because I want you all to know how
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
intimately aware I am of the impact
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
drugs have on our communities overdose
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
deaths have had an incredible toll on
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
community Statewide and I know we share
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
a common goal of public health and
 
04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
safety unfortunately the proposed
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation would not make our
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
communities safer but rather Target
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
those most in need of support and
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Services while the goal
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
of mandatory minimum sentences and
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
harsher penalties for death resulting
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
may be intended to Target large scale
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
dealers that is not what will happen if
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation is passed instead it
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
would result in the incarceration of
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
individuals working tremendously hard to
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
battle substance use disorder create
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
Better Lives for themselves and their
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
loved ones and in many cases simply
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
survive under the unfair circumstances
 
04:46:56.350 --> 04:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
Society has created for them the
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
incarceration of such neighbors would
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
cost New Hampshire taxpayers enormous
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
amounts of money which could better be
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
spent funding evidence-based substance
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
use prevention recovery and harm
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
reduction Services the decision to spend
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money on incarc ation rather
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
than quality and accessible treatment
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
and harm reduction supports would be an
 
04:47:17.788 --> 04:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
error as it would not build up
 
04:47:20.830 --> 04:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
communities but rather ravage them
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
individual punishment does not serve as
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
an effective solution for this communal
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
and societal problem people who use
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
drugs and or are in recovery constitute
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
some of our state's most vulnerable and
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
resilient members and it is our duty to
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
approach this issue with evidence-based
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions I personally know people who
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
have been impacted by mandatory minimum
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing laws and I can assure you
 
04:47:48.030 --> 04:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
that they were not cartel leaders I also
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
know people who had Mand had mandatory
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
minimum sentencing laws been in place
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
would currently be incarcerated instead
 
04:47:57.390 --> 04:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
of given the opportunity to become
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
valuable community members I will never
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
forget sitting with my dearest friend as
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
she was tried for fentanyl possession do
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
the the fact that no mandatory minimum
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
existed the judge assigned to her case
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
was able to determine that she was not a
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
threat to safety but rather a victim
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
herself today instead of being
 
04:48:17.070 --> 04:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated she is in school of
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
pursuing her bachelor's degree and
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
working as a champion for substance use
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
disorder recovery in her Ral Community
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
her story does not have to be
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
unique I think it is somewhat absurd to
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
sit in this room with the assumption
 
04:48:33.430 --> 04:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we are the people who know best how
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
to address this issue it is people who
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
use drugs that are on the front lines it
 
04:48:40.548 --> 04:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
is people who use drugs that don't want
 
04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
their loved ones to Die the most it is
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
people who use drugs who are most
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
infrequently who are most frequently
 
04:48:48.510 --> 04:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
administering the lock Zone otherwise
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
known as our can for these reasons I
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose both bills 414 and
 
04:49:02.110 --> 04:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
you representative Su thank you so much
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
for people who might be watching or
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere can you just explain what SOS
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
recovery is I I'm familiar with it but
 
04:49:13.548 --> 04:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
some people might not be familiar with
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
that acronym absolutely so SOS recovery
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
Community organization is a recovery
 
04:49:20.590 --> 04:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
Community organization that offers peer
 
04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
support in a variety of services so we
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
offer harm reduction support such as
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
providing safe use supplies and we offer
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
support navigating the criminal justice
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
system uh and it really is everything on
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
a day-to-day I can help someone get an
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
ID one minute help them get on a shelter
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
list another minute and provide safe use
 
04:49:43.708 --> 04:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
supplies the next minute so I really
 
04:49:45.548 --> 04:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
believe that the funding of
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based harm reduction Solutions
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
such as those SOS recovery Community
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
organizations provide would be a better
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.638 --> 04:50:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
Barry

04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair honorable
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jake
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm the vice president of policy
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
at new Futures as many of you know new
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
Futures is nonpartisan nonprofit Health
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
policy and advocacy organization we've
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
been working for more than 25 years to
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
address alcohol and substance use issues
 
04:50:35.310 --> 04:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
in our state I don't want to repeat too
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
much of what's been said this afternoon
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
but I do want to stress new Future's
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
strong opposition both to this bill sb14
 
04:50:44.548 --> 04:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
414 and the next bill has be 415 simply
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
put the data shows that mandatory
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
minimums don't work they don't deter
 
04:50:50.110 --> 04:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
individuals from using or selling drugs
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
they don't save lives reduce costs or or
 
04:50:55.470 --> 04:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
reduce human suffering to the contrary
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums often lead to
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
increased incarcerate increased rates of
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
incarceration and greater racial
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
disparities within our Criminal Justice
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
System here in New Hampshire rather than
 
04:51:06.430 --> 04:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
focusing on criminal penalties we have
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
worked hard to recognize substance use
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
disorder for what it is a chronic
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
relapsing condition of the brain that
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be treated not one that needs
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
to be punished uh we have invested to
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
expand our substance use treatment
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
Network we have we have prioritized harm
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
reduction principles and systems we have
 
04:51:24.750 --> 04:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
worked to establish drug courts to try
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
and all for the sake of trying to keep
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
people out of the Criminal Justice
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
System uh data seems to show that this
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
is working as we noted earlier uh the
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
number of Overdose tests recorded in
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
2023 was at
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
422 while that number is far too high it
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
is down 50 from the year prior and
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
looking nationally as was ref referenced
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
earlier our fatal overdose rate uh which
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
was as high as third in the country back
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
in 2016 uh fell to 22nd in 2021 the most
 
04:51:54.670 --> 04:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
recent data
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
available in addition to incarcerating
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
individuals and limiting their access to
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
treatment we fear that these bills will
 
04:52:02.350 --> 04:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
punish taxpayers and stretch the budgets
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
of our prisons and jails and our
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
counties which are already stretch to
 
04:52:04.958 --> 04:52:05.628 align:start position:0%
counties which are already stretch to
their

04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
limits uh a recent report from the
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
Council of state governments shows that
 
04:52:11.548 --> 04:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
it costs our counties and average 100 of
 
04:52:13.948 --> 04:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
$185 to house a single inmate for a
 
04:52:16.750 --> 04:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
single day extend that over the 3 and2
 
04:52:18.548 --> 04:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
year minimum sentence required under
 
04:52:27.150 --> 04:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.160 --> 04:52:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
$236,300

04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
$236,300
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
75,200 much of which will fall on the
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
backs of taxpayers imagine if we just
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
put a fraction of that money towards
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment and Recovery uh
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
systems and programs for these people in
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
need it would certainly go a long way to
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
help help increase access to treatment
 
04:52:48.110 --> 04:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
and help individuals achieve long-term
 
04:52:49.628 --> 04:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
recovery and helping our state finally
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
bring an end to this addiction crisis
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we urge you to oppose
 
04:52:57.390 --> 04:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
both SP 414 and 415 and vote them itl uh
 
04:53:01.270 --> 04:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions of Stone thank you madam chair
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
in your opinion do you feel that the
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
individual that results in the death of
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
another human being should basically be
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
giving a
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
warning I no no certainly not I think
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
that there are many you know there there
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
are many tools within our criminal
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
justice system to address this now I I
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
think that I would say that it's a you
 
04:53:25.030 --> 04:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
know this is a complicated question I
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
think that when you're talking about
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder you're talking
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
about addiction distribution of drug you
 
04:53:32.350 --> 04:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
know many people um I think we all have
 
04:53:33.868 --> 04:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
in our minds the idea of these drug
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
cartels that are coming in and selling
 
04:53:37.230 --> 04:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
in large quantities and targeting people
 
04:53:39.070 --> 04:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
I think that uh you know when it comes
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
to distribution of drugs it's not always
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
that easy it's not that clear-cut I
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
think that this bill the way it's
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
written would broadly apply to people
 
04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
who again are not selling in huge
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
quantities but are are using themselves
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
or sharing with Friends uh and you know
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
they they far too many people are dying
 
04:53:58.030 --> 04:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of that but some of the people
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
who are connected to this are
 
04:54:01.948 --> 04:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
experiencing again addiction themselves
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that they uh these are
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
things that need to be treated for their
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
sake for the sake of their families and
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the sake of our entire State I think
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
that U you know again I think treatment
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
is um the
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
priority could you give me your
 
04:54:17.548 --> 04:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
definition of what a street level dealer
 
04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
is oh there are others um there are
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
others in the room who could answer that
 
04:54:23.070 --> 04:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
much better than I do I would certainly
 
04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
um defer to Professor Sher or others who
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
who work more closely with it than me
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
but I think that um again in in our view
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
I think that many of us picture have a
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
certain picture in our mind of what a
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
street level dealer is but I think that
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
they uh it's much harder to Define than
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
that and applies to many people well
 
04:54:42.910 --> 04:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.920 --> 04:54:45.788 align:start position:0%
 
thank

Community
 
04:55:24.910 --> 04:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
organization we have peer-based recovery
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
centers in Dover Rochester Hampton um we
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
also off we also provide a Workforce
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
Development restaurant social Enterprise
 
04:55:34.670 --> 04:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant in summersworth we employ
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
about 27
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
individuals um and I a person in the
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery with experience with
 
04:55:44.190 --> 04:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
drug use and homelessness I have a
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
daughter who is in recovery and am a
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
family member and I am standing here in
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to both um 414 and 415 um I
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
think these are harmful bills I think
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
it's important to look at the human
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
element behind what these policies
 
04:56:04.510 --> 04:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
address and it's stunning to me that we
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
are talking about mandatory minimums
 
04:56:07.990 --> 04:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
because we've already been down this
 
04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
road we did this in the 80s it it failed
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
miserably there's a plethora of of data
 
04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide data that showed that all it
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
did was increase overdose death rates
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
not decrease them there was no evidence
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
to show that it helped people stop using
 
04:56:27.310 --> 04:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
drugs what it what there is evidence to
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
show is that it put more people in
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
prison and that's it and and did so with
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
wide disparities because we know that
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
when we look at our drug policies in
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
this country that there's a disparity
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
for communities of color and those
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
impacted by poverty and so this
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
increases those disparities because it
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
is the people who are the most
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
marginalized and the most vulnerable
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
that tend to be um affected by mandatory
 
04:56:56.670 --> 04:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
minimums it takes the discretion away
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
from judges and it gives them to the
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutor which in turn results in um
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
unfair like if if we're appointing
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
judges and we're confirming them and we
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
trust that they're neutral why do we
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
want to take their Authority away and
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
hand that to the prosecution and and un
 
04:57:17.590 --> 04:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
unbalance um the sentences that already
 
04:57:19.990 --> 04:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
exist and I also think when we look at
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
people who use drugs we work we provide
 
04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
harm reduction supplies and services at
 
04:57:25.868 --> 04:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
all of our recovery centers um we do
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach with our homeless
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
communities you know when we look at
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
three and a half years for five
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
grams the basically what you're
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
targeting there is the individual who
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
has the car and the license to go pick
 
04:57:43.548 --> 04:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
up their substances and often times that
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
money is pulled with three or four of
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
their peers that they're using with and
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
now they're looking at a three and a
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
half year prison sentence cuz they had
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
the car they had the transportation It's
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
Not Unusual on a day-to-day basis for me
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
to work with individuals with with daily
 
04:58:00.670 --> 04:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
use of two to three grams upwards of
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
five grams sometimes so five grams could
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
be what somebody uses in a day and yet
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
here we are looking at a 3 and a half
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
year prison sentence what they do need
 
04:58:10.990 --> 04:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
is they have a health care issue here we
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a chronic health issue that needs
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
treatment it needs recovery supports it
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
does not need more prison time all the
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
prison time is going to do is is create
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
more barriers it removes access to them
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
receiving any sort of help and when
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
they're released they now have a myriad
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
more be more of a myriad of more
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
barriers to getting well and increases
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
and there's evidence to show that that
 
04:58:37.628 --> 04:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
will that for those incarcerated it is
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
only going to increase recidivism
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
because what they're going to learn ins
 
04:58:41.310 --> 04:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
out of a prison is not going to help
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
them on the outside when they get out so
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I these are troubling um
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
because I look at the work we do and at
 
04:58:54.430 --> 04:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
every turn in order to to be funded we
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
have to prove that what we're doing is
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and we do and nothing we
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
do that's funded isn't evident
 
04:59:03.430 --> 04:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but yet we move forward
 
04:59:05.470 --> 04:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
policies like this and say we will
 
04:59:07.868 --> 04:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
support them with evidence that says
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're harmful and there's no evidence
 
04:59:11.548 --> 04:59:11.558 align:start position:0%
that can be provided that's going to
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
show this is going to reduce overdose
 
04:59:15.190 --> 04:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
deaths there's no evidence that this is
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
going to reduce drug use deterrence like
 
04:59:19.948 --> 04:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
this is not a deterrent and there's no
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
evidence that shows it is and yet we
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
keep pounding our fists on the table
 
04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
saying well maybe if we just increase
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
the penalties people will listen and
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
they'll stop you know the the I
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
constantly see people that I know facing
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
death resulting people that I've worked
 
04:59:37.030 --> 04:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
with in our recovery centers trust me if
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
I know them they're not connected to
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
cartels these are street level kids and
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
these are people who are sharing their
 
04:59:45.390 --> 04:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
drugs with their friends there you don't
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
even have to sell to get a death
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
resulting all you have to do is go buy a
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
bag and share it with two or three of
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
your friends and you are now guilty of
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
death resulting if one of them dies and
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the point that was made about the
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
immunity laws in New Hampshire we do
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
Nock Zone training on the streets in in
 
05:00:04.190 --> 05:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
our Outreach on a regular basis when we
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
tell them encourage them we part of our
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
training is encourage them to call 911
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
and regularly we hear from participants
 
05:00:12.910 --> 05:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not calling 911 not with those death
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
resulting laws if I'm using with
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
somebody there's no way I'm calling 911
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so we encourage them to call anyways
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
and run when they hear the siren if if
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
nothing else just so that that person
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
gets Medical Care um and we know these
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
are the people that are reversing
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
overdoses way more people are overdose
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
deaths are reversed with public
 
05:00:32.350 --> 05:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
administration of Noone by people who
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
use drugs than by First Responders and
 
05:00:37.150 --> 05:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's terrifying to me that they're
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
scared to call um and that that tends to
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
increase overdose deaths rather than
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
help it when we put laws like these in
 
05:00:46.110 --> 05:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
place so I I thank you all for listening
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
and hearing our testimony and I hope you
 
05:00:51.310 --> 05:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
will um oppose both of these pieces of
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:56.670 --> 05:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Burns is there any
 
05:00:59.548 --> 05:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative n thank you
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
question um I think a lot of the framing
 
05:01:08.350 --> 05:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
is around um um harsher penalties being
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
more of a deterrent so my my question is
 
05:01:13.708 --> 05:01:13.718 align:start position:0%
in your experience working with so many
 
05:01:16.430 --> 05:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
people not uh not the least of which is
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
yourself and and your daughter um is are
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
fear stress and shame conducive to
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
recovery are they do um does that
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
increase your potential for Recovery or
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh decrease it no in my opinion well the
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
definition of a substance use disorder
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
is problematic or chaotic use regardless
 
05:01:36.798 --> 05:01:37.510 align:start position:0%
is problematic or chaotic use regardless
of

05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:01:40.830 --> 05:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
consequences so our aren't worried about
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
consequences when we have a substance
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
use disorder it's we're focused on not
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
getting sick generally speaking at least
 
05:01:50.110 --> 05:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
that was my experience I didn't I wasn't
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
I figured I wouldn't get arrested for
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
anything I did um and my cat use didn't
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
lead to fear of being arrested uh than
 
05:02:03.548 --> 05:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
run if I saw police near me so thank
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you um I know that you been
 
05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
working as an advocate um since
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
before this legislature passed into law
 
05:02:22.590 --> 05:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
the immunity um when you're reporting an
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
overdose how could you speak in more
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
detail to how the passage of that
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
affected overdose death rates and how
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
you believe a mandatory minimum would
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
affect the rate of death yeah I don't
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
know how much the mandat minimum is
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to affect it um I I can't help it
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
I know that what I do know is that prior
 
05:02:47.590 --> 05:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
to that immunity law being
 
05:02:50.190 --> 05:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
passed there was widespread what we
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
would call dumping of of people at
 
05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
hospital room entries where you would
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
literally like it was like a tuck and
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
roll people would just drive by the
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
emergency room open a door and push
 
05:03:01.548 --> 05:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
people out that it overdosed because
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
they were so afraid of getting arrested
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
and they still wanted them to get help
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
but they were not in a position where
 
05:03:08.830 --> 05:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
they were they were too scared of of an
 
05:03:11.310 --> 05:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
arrest at that at at that moment um I
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
remember people pulling up to our
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
recovery centers out front with somebody
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
overdosing in their car that's happened
 
05:03:19.868 --> 05:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
multiple times prior to the immunity law
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
um where they would come and they'd run
 
05:03:23.070 --> 05:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
in the door like I know you guys have no
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
lockone right and we'd go out and help
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
them reverse that overdose so um and and
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
what I have seen is as the Attorney
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
General's office Focus their
 
05:03:35.548 --> 05:03:35.558 align:start position:0%
prosecutions around death resulting we
 
05:03:38.350 --> 05:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
have seen that it has had a substantial
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
that immunity law and watering it down
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
to the point that people don't take it
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
that seriously so mandatory minimums is
 
05:03:48.190 --> 05:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
only going to increase I think that
 
05:03:51.310 --> 05:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
attitude and that fear that what's like
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.718 --> 05:04:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
Lin

05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Ted lothstein
 
05:04:20.910 --> 05:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me I am here on
 
05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Association
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
of criminal offense lawyers I'm um been
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
a criminal offense lawyer here in New
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 29 years and a member of
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
that Organization for almost that entire
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
time and the first thing I want to say
 
05:04:38.548 --> 05:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
is I understand where the anger that
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
lies behind a
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
like this comes from you know I've
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
raised my wife and I have raised our
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
children to quazi adulthood here in
 
05:04:50.190 --> 05:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
conquer over the last 20 year 22
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
years and um and elsewhere in New
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um we've traveled around
 
05:04:57.150 --> 05:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
the country and seen the ravages of
 
05:04:59.070 --> 05:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
drugs in cities and here in New
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's really hard and I see
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
it in my job every
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
day um I understand the sense that you
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
know we got to do something big we have
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
to make a statement but this is the
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
wrong approach it's the wrong approach
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
because it just transfers discretion I
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
mean that these types of bills the
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
people who support mandatory minimums
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
which we used to have in New Hampshire
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
and realize were wrong and mostly got
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
rid of but people who support them want
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
to take away discretion from a judge but
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
all they're doing is giving the same
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
discretion more to the prosecutor who
 
05:05:34.990 --> 05:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
decides what charge to bring in the
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
first place um in the Senate hearing a
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
state police sergeant I believe
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
testified very correctly by the way that
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
that um death result in cases are
 
05:05:48.990 --> 05:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove they are very
 
05:05:52.270 --> 05:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove prosecutors tend to
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
prefer loow hanging fruit things that
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
are easier to prove someone in this in
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
this room asked a question you know what
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
are we talking about here are we talking
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
about BigTime drug dealers or are we
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
talking about people who do drugs
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
together and the senator correctly
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
stated that our definition of dispan
 
05:06:11.788 --> 05:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
distribute just means to give it to
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else it doesn't matter if it's
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
people using together and and um I think
 
05:06:19.590 --> 05:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the other speakers we just heard
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
would agree drug using is a very
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
communal activity a very shared activity
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
just like drinking alcohol people obtain
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
it together share it with each other and
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
use it together and so which case will
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
be the first to prosecute is the easiest
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
and that's simple um two people who are
 
05:06:44.110 --> 05:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
um drug addicted friends or
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
acquaintances um you one of them gets
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
the drugs using shared money they do it
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
together and someone um overdoses at
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
that point what would a good person do a
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
good person at that point obviously will
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
call for help and try to save their
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
friend's life what would a bad person do
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
run because as the state police sergeant
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
said it's very hard to prove these
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
cases um when the person stays helps and
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
tells the police what happens it's the
 
05:07:17.230 --> 05:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
good person who will get the 10-year
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum not the bad person who
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
flees because they're somehow aware of
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
this law and don't want to get a 10-year
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum so it goes after it
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
ends up being applied to the wrong
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
people again the prosecutor decides are
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
we just going to charge a person with
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
possession are we going to charge them
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
with distribution or are we going to
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
charge them with death resulting that is
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
100% a decision made by a prosecutor
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
often right at of law school often
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 30 years old often who
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
has not been married raised children and
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
gone you know had all the life
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
experiences and heartache we have over a
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
longer period of Our Lives they don't
 
05:08:00.990 --> 05:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
have the life experiences and the wisdom
 
05:08:03.628 --> 05:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
of Judges they're also making decisions
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
that are not accountable when a judge
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
makes a decision she has to say it out
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
loud or write it down and you can take
 
05:08:11.788 --> 05:08:11.798 align:start position:0%
to a higher Court when prosecutors make
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
a decision who to go after with the
 
05:08:18.190 --> 05:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
death with the mandatory minimum um they
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
they make their decisions in private
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
without having to State their reasons
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
and and almost completely
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
unreviewable um so moving the discretion
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
from judges who can sentence all the way
 
05:08:33.070 --> 05:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
up to life in prison but don't have a
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
floor to prosecutors to decide which
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
people should get 10 years here's what
 
05:08:40.830 --> 05:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
that that will lead to one is it will
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
lead to the the the great the greatest
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
injustices you know because again it's
 
05:08:48.430 --> 05:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
much harder to prove it with a
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
sophisticated person who who who be who
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
conceals their tracks than against a
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable street level person who did
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
drugs with their friend and then tried
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
to save their friend's life
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully um and so the most
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people will be the ones
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
targeted for the mandatory minimums but
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
the other problem with mandatory
 
05:09:11.470 --> 05:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
minimums is that mandatory minimums
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
cause innocent people to go to prison
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
and that really applies here because the
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
people who are innocent in these
 
05:09:20.548 --> 05:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
scenarios They're Not Innocent of all
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing they they're using drugs
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
maybe they're sharing drugs maybe
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
they're selling drugs but again as the
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
state police sergeant said it's very
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
hard to figure out and to prove who
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
actually supplied the drugs that killed
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
the person because addicts have so many
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
different sources and so much and and
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
drugs are just passed around um and so
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
what you know what you end up with is
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
that a person who dispensed gave or sold
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
drugs that didn't kill the deceased is
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for death resulting and is
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're told by their lawyer we can take
 
05:09:58.750 --> 05:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
it to trial but if he lose there's a
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
10-year mandatory minimum and
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutors use that as a cudgle to get
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
the person to agree to five six seven
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
years in prison 2 three four years in
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
prison the same person that for the the
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
same crime would have gotten um maybe a
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
diversion program maybe a house of
 
05:10:16.030 --> 05:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
correction sentence maybe their first
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
felony conviction but not
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
prison um and so it's a it's a a
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
powerful tool that's too easy to abuse
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums because it forces
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
people into decision- making like well
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
even though I'm innocent if there's a
 
05:10:33.310 --> 05:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
20% chance I'll be convicted after trial
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm being offered one year in prison
 
05:10:38.470 --> 05:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll do 10 if I'm wrongfully
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
convicted I guess I'll just say that I'm
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
the one who caused the
 
05:10:43.520 --> 05:10:46.868 align:start position:0%
the one who caused the
death

05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.230 --> 05:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
so what happens at that point is
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
prosecutors then say okay you've agreed
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
to app plea bargain will remove the
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
death resulting part so you don't have
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
to face the 10-year mandatory minimum
 
05:10:58.590 --> 05:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
and you will sign up for whatever prison
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
sentence you signed up for under that
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
duress the New Hampshire Association of
 
05:11:06.030 --> 05:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
criminal offense lawyers opposes both um
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
415 and four and Senate Bill 415 but my
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
comments would be exactly the same and
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
um I read the sheet that's going to be
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
distributed by Devon chaffy the ACLU and
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Association criminal
 
05:11:20.670 --> 05:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers agrees with all those
 
05:11:22.510 --> 05:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
points and that's why I haven't repeated
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
them here
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
today thank you the committee have any
 
05:11:28.680 --> 05:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
today thank you the committee have any
questions

05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um Mr chair um
 
05:11:37.110 --> 05:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
I'm curious um so I live in Durham we
 
05:11:43.150 --> 05:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
have the university so if we have Joe
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
college student who has come to school
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
with what they believe is a bottle of
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
Aderall that they've picked up from a
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
friend um and they say to their study
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
group okay we all need a lot more energy
 
05:11:57.150 --> 05:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
and more focused I've got this Aderall
 
05:11:58.990 --> 05:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
we could just share it so they
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
distributed except that they didn't test
 
05:12:02.590 --> 05:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
it because they just thought it was
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
Aderall and it turns out that it's not
 
05:12:08.110 --> 05:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
just Aderall and one of their peers dies
 
05:12:09.868 --> 05:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
would that based on your interpretation
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
of this law would that person then be
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
subject to the 10-year mandatory minimum
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
if if it was leased with one of these
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
um category drugs yes and I think the
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
senator correctly answered that question
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cel that is because it's
 
05:12:26.110 --> 05:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
a strict liability crime all they have
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
to prove is the person knew they were
 
05:12:30.190 --> 05:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
distrib dispensing a controlled drug
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have to know which controlled
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
drug it was they don't have to know is
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
ventanal it's a very pertinent question
 
05:12:38.670 --> 05:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
because a lot of opiate drugs are sold
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
in the street now have fentanyl instead
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
of what the person expects there to be
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're it's awful they're now sold in
 
05:12:47.470 --> 05:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
pill form so that you know the pill
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
resembles like a perco set but you don't
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
know is it opiates in there or is it
 
05:12:54.670 --> 05:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
something else or is it fentanyl so
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I think the college
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
setting is the best way to understand
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
this because most of us have been to
 
05:13:02.670 --> 05:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
college at least for a while and um in
 
05:13:04.270 --> 05:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
that setting you know if there's several
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
people in a room and there's a case of
 
05:13:10.030 --> 05:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
beer we all know that not not every
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
Everybody didn't go out and buy one beer
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
each somebody pulled money or somebody
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
just went out and bought a case of beer
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
that person is the person dispensing the
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
beer just like in your question whoever
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
brought in the drug that they thought
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
was I can't remember what drug you said
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
but they thought was not venl that
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:45.070 --> 05:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
I suppose on that in that vein could
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
there be
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
complications I guess I'm foreseeing
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
consequences with this legislation in
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
situations where someone might be caring
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
for an elderly person or someone
 
05:13:55.320 --> 05:13:57.628 align:start position:0%
for an elderly person or someone
who

05:13:57.628 --> 05:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:14:00.270 --> 05:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
um does the I guess does the bill
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
clarify the difference between elicit
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
and prescription
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
overdoses um because I know that people
 
05:14:11.708 --> 05:14:11.718 align:start position:0%
with cancer take Fentanyl and people
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
post surgery take
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
oxycoton I think well the I mean the
 
05:14:19.390 --> 05:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
definition of a controlled drug is not
 
05:14:22.670 --> 05:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
prescribed so and I think most of that
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that the fentanyl was
 
05:14:25.390 --> 05:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
prescribed I think that would take it
 
05:14:32.548 --> 05:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
Newman thank thank you for taking my
 
05:14:42.548 --> 05:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
question um the bill is it's written and
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just take a little bit of it here
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
that says shall be sentenced to the
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentences shall shall
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
be sentenced to not less than 10 years
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
of imprisonment does that leave room in
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
there for a plea bargain before a trial
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
or does that wording mean that they
 
05:15:02.548 --> 05:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
would have to go through a trial and
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
then be sentenced and then the mandatory
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
minimum would apply or or could or does
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
the men I guess my bottom line question
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
does the mandatory minimum apply if they
 
05:15:15.868 --> 05:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
were offered a plead bargain of some
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
nature maybe they'd have to go to a
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
lesser penalty right that's what I was
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that that if the start
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
the charge to begin with is a death
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
resulting charge the prosor can always
 
05:15:30.150 --> 05:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
offer a plea bargain to just
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
distribution of the drug possession of
 
05:15:35.230 --> 05:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
the drug you know some reckless conduct
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
as a felony some other offense and so
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's ways to get out of the 10 years
 
05:15:42.110 --> 05:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
and what this these bills do is it just
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
gives that power to a 28-year-old
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor who's been at a law school
 
05:15:49.150 --> 05:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
for 3 years instead of giving it to a
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
judge who's been vetted by the executive
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
councel appointed by a governor and um
 
05:15:56.590 --> 05:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
and subject to a pellet
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
down thank you honorable members of the
 
05:16:25.070 --> 05:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
Devon chaffy I'm the executive director
 
05:16:30.510 --> 05:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the ACLU of New Hampshire and I am
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
here today to testify an opposition to
 
05:16:32.878 --> 05:16:33.948 align:start position:0%
here today to testify an opposition to
HB

05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:16:37.390 --> 05:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
414 um I want to start by just putting
 
05:16:39.750 --> 05:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
um these bills in context right today
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear three bills that
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
create mandatory minimums for drug
 
05:16:47.470 --> 05:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
related crimes um I want to just hearken
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
back to um a point that was made by a
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that recently New
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has very much moved away from
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
all mandatory minimums across the board
 
05:17:00.910 --> 05:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
in its criminal code um and in fact in
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
I've been advocating at the state house
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
for a little over a decade and there
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
have been very few times when I have
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
seen proposals to introduce new
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums most of the bills I
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
have seen over the years have all been
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
pulling back on mandatory minimums
 
05:17:20.788 --> 05:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
sentences in our laws um and there is so
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
this this these bills together represent
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
a significant shift and would represent
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
a significant shift in how uh New
 
05:17:30.548 --> 05:17:30.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire goes about administering
 
05:17:33.310 --> 05:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice in our system and there
 
05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
are many reasons I believe why New
 
05:17:38.910 --> 05:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has chosen not to go um
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward with across the board like um
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
many mandatory minimums especially in
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the uh drug context and I do want to
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
highlight that that support for reducing
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums has historically come
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
from both sides of the aisle um and I
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
would never speak for another
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
organization but I do think it's worth
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
noting here today that both the New
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liberty Alliance and the
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity both opposed
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
these bills in the Senate so these are
 
05:18:07.470 --> 05:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
two fairly conservative traditionally
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
considered conservative organiz ations
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
who opposed these bills in the Senate
 
05:18:13.390 --> 05:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
because of the mandatory minimums and
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why there's historically been
 
05:18:17.830 --> 05:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
this opposition to mandatory minimums is
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as I think fourfold one
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
they are expensive two they are
 
05:18:27.310 --> 05:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
uneffective three they're sort of a oniz
 
05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
fits-all form of justice that don't take
 
05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
into account the particulars of a given
 
05:18:36.430 --> 05:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
case and finally they transfer judicial
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
discretion away from the Judiciary and
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
two prosecutors as was described earlier
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to dig more into some of
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
these points um and when I testify on HB
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
415 in a moment but for right now I
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
really want to focus on the particularly
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
egregious aspects of HB 415 which is of
 
05:19:00.270 --> 05:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
course creating uh 10-year mandatory
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
minimum for death resulting which as has
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
been discussed is a strict liability
 
05:19:07.750 --> 05:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
crime you don't have to know what you
 
05:19:09.628 --> 05:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
are uh pass passing to another
 
05:19:12.190 --> 05:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
individual in order to be subject to
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
this mandatory minimum and it's a crime
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
of essentially passing drugs to someone
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
else who then dies of an
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
overdose and I know that the senator in
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill says that well he
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
thinks it's unlikely that the folks that
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be that are prosecuted
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
under this law are are the the friends
 
05:19:31.708 --> 05:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
or the loved ones of the person who
 
05:19:34.270 --> 05:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
eventually dies but I want to tell you
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that there has been a national
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
analysis of the prosecution under death
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
resulting laws across this nation and
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
the conclusion has been that it is not
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
drug dealers that are primarily
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and when you think about it
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be surprising because
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
drug dealers don't stick around long
 
05:19:56.110 --> 05:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
enough to get picked up by the cops and
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
Associated by a death instead what we
 
05:20:02.590 --> 05:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
see here and this is again there's been
 
05:20:04.750 --> 05:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
um studies of these
 
05:20:07.150 --> 05:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
prosecutions that show this in many of
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
these deaths we're talking about
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
individuals who are friends and families
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
of the deceased often times themselves
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
struggling with the drug use disorder
 
05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I really encourage you there's been
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
a podcast on this in New Hampshire cases
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
specifically and to read some of the
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
bios of these cases because it is
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching when you read these
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
cases we're talking about friends who go
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
to jail for over a decade because they
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
were using together cuz they were afraid
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
to use alone right there are people a
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
husband whose wife wife uh bought heroin
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
and then asked her husband to please
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
inject her with that heroin and her
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
husband was prosecuted under these laws
 
05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
um a wife whose husband asked her for
 
05:20:51.150 --> 05:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
some some prescribed liquid methadone to
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
help him fall asleep who then passed in
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
his sleep um to and the wife you know
 
05:20:58.750 --> 05:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
woke up and and tragically her husband
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
had passed so these cases I would I
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
would put before you are the definition
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
of why judicial discretion is so
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that the
 
05:21:10.990 --> 05:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
punishments that are meted out under our
 
05:21:14.110 --> 05:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System actually line up
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
with our understanding of what is
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
just moreover and this I cannot
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize enough there has been a lot of
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
studies that demonstrate very clearly
 
05:21:28.470 --> 05:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
that death resulting laws and mandatory
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
minimum sentences do not reduce opioid
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
deaths they do not reduce drug use and
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
they do not reduce crime and I've
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
extensively cited studies and I'll pass
 
05:21:41.470 --> 05:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
out my written testimony in a moment and
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
you can look at those citations um but
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at a particularly um a a
 
05:21:48.788 --> 05:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
particular study of drug induced
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
homicide practices in the jurisdictions
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
of New Jersey Tennessee North Carolina
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
Illinois Louisiana in New York it
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrates clearly that despite
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
dramatic growths in the drug induced
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
homicide prosecutions death resulting
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutions all jurisdictions experienc
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
significant increases in over those
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
deaths in that same year what has worked
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
instead in New Hampshire and this was
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
discussed before were the laws that you
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
all have passed that have actually
 
05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
allowed greater availability of noo Zone
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in the decline in
 
05:22:23.040 --> 05:22:24.670 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in the decline in
overdose

05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
overdose
 
05:22:27.990 --> 05:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
deaths and I just want to end my remarks
 
05:22:30.830 --> 05:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
um because I want you to know that I the
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
the the pain caused by overdo deaths are
 
05:22:37.948 --> 05:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
not the pain caused is not lost on me
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
those deaths are unspeakably tragic and
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
they cause unimaginable pain and anguish
 
05:22:46.350 --> 05:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
and I can relate to that in 2020 I lost
 
05:22:49.628 --> 05:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
um my cousin to an overdose somebody I
 
05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
was very close with um and I grieved
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
with his mom and dad and with my family
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
and so I understand just the sliver of
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the pain that is caused by these deaths
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
in our community and and I have to say
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
that personally when I think about my
 
05:23:07.750 --> 05:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
cousin would I wish for a friend or a
 
05:23:10.510 --> 05:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
girlfriend or a co- user even of my
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
cousins to be jailed for 10 years as
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
retribution for his passing or is what I
 
05:23:19.150 --> 05:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
really wish that he wouldn't have been
 
05:23:21.548 --> 05:23:21.558 align:start position:0%
using a loan that somebody had been
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
there with him who had Naran and could
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
have saved his life and I have to say
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
that for me the answer is clear and for
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
that reason I respectfully ask that you
 
05:23:33.788 --> 05:23:33.798 align:start position:0%
recommend inexpedient to legislate on S
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%

welcome back committee members we are

now opening the public hearing
 
05:39:33.070 --> 05:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill

415 and Senator abbis you're up again
 
05:39:39.788 --> 05:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Senator Daryl abbis
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
I represent District 22 serving the
 
05:39:48.430 --> 05:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
communities of pelum Salem a and plastal
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce sener Bill 415
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
which will increase the penalty for
 
05:39:55.230 --> 05:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
certain fentol related offenses and I
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
heard some members of the public
 
05:39:59.590 --> 05:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
addressing this bill before the hearing
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
opened what when they were testifying on
 
05:40:03.750 --> 05:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the last hearing but I can tell you for
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
sure that if you have 5 grams of
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl more they'll be a mandatory 3
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
and A2 years in jail if you have 28
 
05:40:14.190 --> 05:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
grams or more then you will face I
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's seven uh years in jails a
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentence uh five grams
 
05:40:22.750 --> 05:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
I hear drug treatment you know rehab
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
mental health 5 grams of fentanyl is
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 2,000 to 2500 lethal doses
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl if you are an addict and you
 
05:40:35.230 --> 05:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
are carrying that much of that drug
 
05:40:38.030 --> 05:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
around uh one you're extreme danger to
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
yourself but it's unlikely that you're
 
05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
just a simple addict just using drugs to
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
get high that is enough to kill every
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
elected body person in in both the house
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and the whole
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
building so when I when I hear that this
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
is you know the substance abuse this is
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
this is someone who's dealing drugs you
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
can make that you can make that leap or
 
05:41:08.830 --> 05:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
presumption so that's what we're
 
05:41:10.590 --> 05:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
addressing so if you have 5 grams of
 
05:41:12.190 --> 05:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
fentanyl on you which or you have over
 
05:41:15.788 --> 05:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
2,000 lethal doses of fentanyl on you
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to face a mandatory
 
05:41:19.510 --> 05:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
sentence of three and a half years
 
05:41:22.510 --> 05:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
because you're I believe with that
 
05:41:24.750 --> 05:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're dealing drugs and that's that's
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
what it is now if you have 28 grams on
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
you I I'm not going to even break down
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
the math but clearly that person's
 
05:41:35.548 --> 05:41:35.558 align:start position:0%
dealing because that person has five
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
times the amount as the other person
 
05:41:36.958 --> 05:41:38.030 align:start position:0%
times the amount as the other person
who's

05:41:38.030 --> 05:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
who's
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
so that's about 10,000 to 12,000 lethal
 
05:41:44.310 --> 05:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
doses now right so that's a mandatory
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
sent sentence as well this person is
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
selling a drug Distributing throughout
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
the community and it's killing people I
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
heard someone say that the addicts and
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
dealers are whatever are better at
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
saving the lives and the First
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
Responders well these people wouldn't be
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
dying in overdosing if not for the
 
05:42:02.788 --> 05:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
dealers so maybe if they're better at
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
Reviving them after they give them
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that almost kills them so
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's what's all right they're there so
 
05:42:10.110 --> 05:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
they're already there so perhaps they're
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing they're able to do it I
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate them trying to save the
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
person's life but they're still
 
05:42:16.468 --> 05:42:16.478 align:start position:0%
Distributing and Drug killing
 
05:42:18.750 --> 05:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
people and I think we got to put a stop
 
05:42:21.070 --> 05:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
to this and one way to do that if the
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
person is in jail they're not selling
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
this on the street killing people in the
 
05:42:28.030 --> 05:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
state simple as that so please hope you
 
05:42:29.788 --> 05:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
support the arthop pass and I'll take
 
05:42:29.798 --> 05:42:33.110 align:start position:0%
support the arthop pass and I'll take
any

05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.868 --> 05:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
questions do you have a question
 
05:42:40.468 --> 05:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
repres I'm sorry oh Representative
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
no thank you madam chairman and thank
 
05:42:44.430 --> 05:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking chairwoman and thank you
 
05:42:47.708 --> 05:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm wondering
 
05:42:50.190 --> 05:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
about uh we we often give these
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
statistics about how much will kill the
 
05:42:55.390 --> 05:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
average person or how much is is a
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
lethal dose but there's also the concept
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
of Tolerance not to get into a
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
story please don't I won't I know I know
 
05:43:07.390 --> 05:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying um but that contributed uh
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
the the lowering of Tolerance based on
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh someone taking Vivitrol contributed
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
to the death of someone I love very much
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so my question is when L by the
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
way thank you um when we talk about
 
05:43:21.788 --> 05:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
these statistics on how much will
 
05:43:23.868 --> 05:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
actually uh kill someone and yet someone
 
05:43:26.590 --> 05:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
else talks about um people doing an
 
05:43:30.030 --> 05:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
average of uh four to six grams a day
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
some some people that to me indicates
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
tolerance so how does this account for
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
the tolerance that someone might have
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
built up in uh in their use over time so
 
05:43:43.390 --> 05:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
two two parts of this number one uh if
 
05:43:44.910 --> 05:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
you have a cutting
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
agent that can
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
create um a higher amount so if you cut
 
05:43:52.990 --> 05:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
the drug which if someone's cutting the
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
drug it's also fair to say that they're
 
05:43:57.628 --> 05:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
a dealer now when someone overdoses it
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that will come
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
into place their overall health you know
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
someone with you know a poor respiratory
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
system is more likely to overdose at
 
05:44:10.110 --> 05:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
least die from the use of uh opioids uh
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
the body weight would matter if they
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
have asthma that would matter there's a
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
lot of things that get factored in um
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
and their tolerance level so and also it
 
05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
depends on how they actually take it
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes as well whether it's injected
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
or if it's you know there's a lot of
 
05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
different ways to do it so there's that
 
05:44:29.310 --> 05:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
this doesn't Factor it in but what I
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
would tell you is that the five grams of
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in you that's not been diluted
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
and diluted several times over is Enough
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
To Kill A lot of people now when I say
 
05:44:45.708 --> 05:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
it's between 2,000 and 2500 lethal doses
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm basing that on on uh what the
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
federal government has reported so will
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
vary from person to person if everyone
 
05:44:54.270 --> 05:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
took the same do yes not everyone will
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
overdose but that's the that's the
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
belief that that's the approximate
 
05:45:01.468 --> 05:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
lethal dose is about 2
 
05:45:04.110 --> 05:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
milligrams follow um just quickly what
 
05:45:07.150 --> 05:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at is that there are
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh many factors that contribute to the
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
potency and um the the harm that
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
something can do but this um but this
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't take that into account and and
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay well I think it does and to
 
05:45:21.548 --> 05:45:21.558 align:start position:0%
an extent thatan when you come up with
 
05:45:23.788 --> 05:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
what the number should be you know if
 
05:45:26.270 --> 05:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
that was three grams or one gram I mean
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
one gram is still lethal doses but at
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
the same time 5
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
gr is is an when I say two 2,000 lethal
 
05:45:38.190 --> 05:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
doses again I I don't I'm not sure what
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
someone's doing with that unless they're
 
05:45:42.350 --> 05:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
selling it that's unlik that is highly
 
05:45:43.990 --> 05:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be for one person's
 
05:45:44.000 --> 05:45:47.350 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be for one person's
individual

05:45:47.350 --> 05:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:51.070 --> 05:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
Newman i' just like to thank you for
 
05:45:55.948 --> 05:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question I would just like to
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
clarify the line beginning
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
on line 19 where it says well it says
 
05:46:06.190 --> 05:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
five five grams or more including any
 
05:46:08.510 --> 05:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
adulter or or
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
dilutant so is it five grand of killing
 
05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
level heroin or how much of it has to be
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not heroin how much of it has to be
 
05:46:22.270 --> 05:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and the rest be dilutant but it
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
comes up to five grams where's the
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
differentiation in there and thank you
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the question I'm really glad you
 
05:46:30.030 --> 05:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
asked that question because I countered
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
that uh in a trafficking statute little
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
South of the Border and uh they mistake
 
05:46:36.910 --> 05:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislator made in Massachusetts
 
05:46:38.590 --> 05:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
is one of The Inspirations of why I ran
 
05:46:40.830 --> 05:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
for office because the fentanyl
 
05:46:42.190 --> 05:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking statute was not drafted
 
05:46:44.030 --> 05:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
correctly which made it impossible to
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
convict someone of trafficking it has
 
05:46:50.350 --> 05:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
since been fixed by the way but um so if
 
05:46:52.510 --> 05:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a synthetic drug you have
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
to include the the mixing of the cutting
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
agent because literally a grain of salt
 
05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
would change the ingredient because it's
 
05:47:02.670 --> 05:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
it's an artificial drug so you really
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any drug whether it's
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
cocaine heroin fentanyl you have to
 
05:47:10.990 --> 05:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
include any dilutant that may alter the
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
weight but when you're dealing with a
 
05:47:14.990 --> 05:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
synthetic drug it can create something
 
05:47:16.468 --> 05:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
all different altogether so you really
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
need to if it doesn't include that it's
 
05:47:21.270 --> 05:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
really hard to prove Purity with a
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
synthetic drug as opposed to like
 
05:47:26.430 --> 05:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
cocaine or heroin that's you know
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
natural drugs I would say follow up
 
05:47:33.310 --> 05:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
follow up so how do how does that affect
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the statistics that you gave out
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
about 200 all the people in the
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and everything how how does
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
that affect those statistics or does it
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm basic on what the federal
 
05:47:45.680 --> 05:47:46.590 align:start position:0%
well I'm basic on what the federal
government

05:47:46.590 --> 05:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:47:48.750 --> 05:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
reported so I I relied on that
 
05:47:50.548 --> 05:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
information I I hope that the
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
information they're putting out there
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
about fentanyl is
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
accurate thank you representative Murray
 
05:47:59.830 --> 05:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:48:02.548 --> 05:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question um we heard during
 
05:48:04.430 --> 05:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
testimony on the previous bill and I
 
05:48:06.150 --> 05:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
think I've seen in this committee that
 
05:48:08.110 --> 05:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
we are moving away from mandatory
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
minimums in general um in the criminal
 
05:48:14.430 --> 05:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
code and um relying more on giving the
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
judges um you know the ability to decide
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
what they think is the appropriate
 
05:48:19.230 --> 05:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
sentence and I'm just wondering if you
 
05:48:22.030 --> 05:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
have any specific reasoning behind
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to bring mandatory minimums into
 
05:48:26.190 --> 05:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
this part of the criminal code are you
 
05:48:29.708 --> 05:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
observing judges um regularly sentencing
 
05:48:32.430 --> 05:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
people to um a shorter time frame than
 
05:48:34.468 --> 05:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
this or is this just something that you
 
05:48:36.390 --> 05:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
think will help I'm just curious if
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
there's anything like behind that sure
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
so the War on Drugs I understand where
 
05:48:45.030 --> 05:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's some strict mandatory sentencing
 
05:48:47.948 --> 05:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
had had some uh some of the statistics
 
05:48:50.788 --> 05:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
that came out suggested that that wasn't
 
05:48:52.510 --> 05:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
the best approach but when we're talking
 
05:48:56.110 --> 05:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
about simple possession charges that's I
 
05:48:58.190 --> 05:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
understand why that's not a mandatory
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
sentence simple possession that is a
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
drug addict that is someone that needs
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
help I understand that there's a lot of
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
things that can contribute to why that
 
05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
person is in that situation untreated
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
mental health issues or even if they
 
05:49:11.868 --> 05:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
getting treated for mental health issues
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
they could have suffered traumatic
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
events there's a lot of things that
 
05:49:15.070 --> 05:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
contribute to
 
05:49:17.548 --> 05:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
that it's the drug dealers that are the
 
05:49:19.628 --> 05:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
problem here you if there were no drug
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
dealers the overwhelming majority of of
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
this problem would be gone it wouldn't
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
exist anymore you would have some very
 
05:49:28.990 --> 05:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
small problem here because not only are
 
05:49:31.430 --> 05:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
they infecting people who are addicts
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
literally they're they're in the sales
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
business they're seeking out new people
 
05:49:40.030 --> 05:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
to sell their drug to to create new
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
addicts the other problem is is when
 
05:49:43.390 --> 05:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
people get out of rehab or they get out
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
of jail they go right back in the same
 
05:49:47.830 --> 05:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
circle of friends who are many are
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
addicts and I had a friend he was sober
 
05:49:52.230 --> 05:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
for three months and he he actually
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
started putting on some he was you know
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
real frail from his drug use and when he
 
05:49:58.110 --> 05:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
was getting rid of some of his old
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
clothes he found something in one of his
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
pockets that was kind of left over he
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
was right back to it and he's still an
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
act today so it's it's pretty sad how
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
easy it is for someone to fall back off
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
the ladder that quickly so the but even
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
though that was not a drug dealing thing
 
05:50:17.310 --> 05:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
the dealers this focus on the dealer and
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's leading to the deaths
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's what's leading to these further
 
05:50:22.110 --> 05:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
problems and you know the people who are
 
05:50:25.030 --> 05:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
relapsing a big part of it is the
 
05:50:26.350 --> 05:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
dealers and if you have this much
 
05:50:28.030 --> 05:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
fentanyl on you I don't think it's
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to assume that you're
 
05:50:29.120 --> 05:50:30.310 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to assume that you're
Distributing

05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
Distributing
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
it follow up thank you madam chair I
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm not quite referring to you
 
05:50:37.868 --> 05:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
know treating dealers differently than
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
um those who are just possessing but
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
more like mandatory minimums as a tool
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
um like have you seen judges regularly
 
05:50:50.948 --> 05:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
um you know in their discretion under
 
05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
sentence in your opinion um in these
 
05:50:56.750 --> 05:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
cases that you think it's necessary to
 
05:50:59.350 --> 05:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
create a mandatory minimum so I I
 
05:51:00.910 --> 05:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say I observe an individual
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
judge a lot of when it comes to
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
sentencing there's so many factors to go
 
05:51:06.270 --> 05:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
into places they first offense do they
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a is the prior criminal record
 
05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's pled down to from like a
 
05:51:12.750 --> 05:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
higher charge to a lower charge so it's
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
really circumstantial and keep mind this
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
is five grams let's just say you had 27
 
05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
grams so you just missed that seven-year
 
05:51:21.310 --> 05:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
cut off that's a bigger deal than if you
 
05:51:23.830 --> 05:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
had let's say six grams or so I think
 
05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a big part of it is uh a lot of
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
the other circumstantial things that can
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
go into this also it's the strength of
 
05:51:32.510 --> 05:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
the case when they enter a plea that
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
that may play an impact there may be
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
some evidential issues we don't know
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
about so lot there's so many things that
 
05:51:39.868 --> 05:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
go into sentencing uh what I will tell
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
you living on the border of you know
 
05:51:44.830 --> 05:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
where methu and Lawrence is I Lawrence
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
is you know it's been titled the
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
fentanyl Hub of New England if they're
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
going to if people want to engage and
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
behave yourself Bo I can't control that
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
but in my district right along the
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
border uh for someone who represents
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
criminals they're well aware of when
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're in what jurisdiction they are
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and what the penalties are and I I can
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
my source is very reliable
 
05:52:08.160 --> 05:52:09.590 align:start position:0%
my source is very reliable
thank

05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
you I should say
 
05:52:15.948 --> 05:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
sources representative SEL thank you and
 
05:52:19.590 --> 05:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
in straford County where we've had
 
05:52:23.788 --> 05:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
tremendous success from our drug courts
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so this seems to be the kind of
 
05:52:28.150 --> 05:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
thing that would take diversion programs
 
05:52:30.510 --> 05:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
like that away as an opportunity and I'm
 
05:52:30.520 --> 05:52:31.230 align:start position:0%
like that away as an opportunity and I'm
just

05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:52:34.468 --> 05:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
wondering um you know in in certain
 
05:52:36.510 --> 05:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
cases uh for example we hit testimony
 
05:52:38.190 --> 05:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
previously that it may well be someone
 
05:52:39.910 --> 05:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
who's just pulled the funds because they
 
05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
had the vehicle to go pick up the stash
 
05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
for their their group of friends um and
 
05:52:47.548 --> 05:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
so where someone might be better suited
 
05:52:49.390 --> 05:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
by going into a treatment program and
 
05:52:52.510 --> 05:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
through the drug court programs I just
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
curious how you see this as being able
 
05:52:57.270 --> 05:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
to balance with that so if let's say
 
05:52:59.868 --> 05:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
there's a group of four friends one per
 
05:53:02.708 --> 05:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
one of the four goes to buy a large
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
amount of fentanyl for the group of four
 
05:53:06.030 --> 05:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
and it exceeds the five grams and how
 
05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
how that would impact them at least
 
05:53:10.110 --> 05:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for the drug court a
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
drug diversion program if that's the
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
case one is still Distributing fanol
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
which you know could lead to their
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
friends or friends death so there's that
 
05:53:22.468 --> 05:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
issue but there's also some some
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
discretion of the prosecutor and how
 
05:53:26.510 --> 05:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
they want to handle that uh but if
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have over five grams
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
and they get caught with that amount I
 
05:53:33.190 --> 05:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
mean again they they're gathering this
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
and they're Distributing that's my whole
 
05:53:35.548 --> 05:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
point is that they're not just using
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes but please just ask the questions
 
05:53:41.280 --> 05:53:43.110 align:start position:0%
yes but please just ask the questions
okay

05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:45.910 --> 05:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative um you're welcome I to
 
05:53:47.948 --> 05:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
clarify so you would give the discretion
 
05:53:49.468 --> 05:53:49.478 align:start position:0%
to the prosecutor and not to the judge
 
05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
case well I'm this bill would not do
 
05:53:55.868 --> 05:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
that what I'm saying is the prosecutor
 
05:53:58.830 --> 05:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
could in their discretion offer to
 
05:54:01.230 --> 05:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the charge as part of diversion
 
05:54:03.468 --> 05:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
program that happens uh frequently
 
05:54:05.868 --> 05:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
especially with someone who has um you
 
05:54:08.590 --> 05:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
know a lighter record shall we say uh
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
someone who has kids if there's you know
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're working they're gainfully
 
05:54:13.510 --> 05:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
employed sometimes it's you know if
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
someone's not working and they have all
 
05:54:16.990 --> 05:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
this money you know it's pretty again
 
05:54:18.510 --> 05:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
they can kind of put it all together
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's not rocket science but the person
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
has you know some other circumstance
 
05:54:24.468 --> 05:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
going on that the prosec may be more
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
inclined to uh offer that also again
 
05:54:28.230 --> 05:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
strength of evidence a lot of things
 
05:54:30.030 --> 05:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
that go into it but I think I don't
 
05:54:31.868 --> 05:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
think it it would it completely prohibit
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
them from being involved in it it just
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
um again but I think the example you
 
05:54:37.270 --> 05:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
used sounds like they they're
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
still representative Stone thank you
 
05:54:44.830 --> 05:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for Tak you my
 
05:54:47.390 --> 05:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
question in your experience uh when
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
involving uh what we call drug dealers
 
05:54:52.270 --> 05:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
in the state builds a case is it usually
 
05:54:53.788 --> 05:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
uh one occurrence of a sale or is it
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
usually multiple sales before the actual
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
charges are brought with a intent to
 
05:54:59.670 --> 05:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
distribute or possession with intent to
 
05:54:59.680 --> 05:55:01.708 align:start position:0%
distribute or possession with intent to
distribute

05:55:01.708 --> 05:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
I it's kind of it's It's both I mean the
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
larger ones are usually the subject of a
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
much large you know large investigation
 
05:55:10.670 --> 05:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's a kind of an Enterprise
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
or going on with several that's L done
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
with a lot of different law enforcement
 
05:55:18.910 --> 05:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
agencies involved uh when it comes to
 
05:55:21.788 --> 05:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
like stuff like this your lower level
 
05:55:25.628 --> 05:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
dealers um that's Lui sometimes they
 
05:55:26.948 --> 05:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
they can Target the person but sometimes
 
05:55:29.230 --> 05:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
they can it can be as simple as either a
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
they know the person is been involved
 
05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
and has a prior history and they kind of
 
05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
can then see they're going to an area
 
05:55:35.948 --> 05:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
where that's known for drug trafficking
 
05:55:35.958 --> 05:55:36.750 align:start position:0%
where that's known for drug trafficking
and

05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:38.670 --> 05:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
engage in behavior that way sometimes
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
they witness hand to hands and sometimes
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
they don't you know when they SE a
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
person after they arrest them when they
 
05:55:45.628 --> 05:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
observe the hand to hand the person will
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a large quantity on them uh
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's when you know drunk
 
05:55:51.430 --> 05:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
driving arrest can Le these so it can be
 
05:55:53.590 --> 05:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that kind of can invoke
 
05:55:56.350 --> 05:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
this type of charge thank you in
 
05:55:58.990 --> 05:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
followup in addition prior testimony you
 
05:56:00.910 --> 05:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
gave was that uh certain individuals
 
05:56:02.670 --> 05:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
might be inclined to become a
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
cooperating individual if they do have a
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
charge and obviously if you're in the
 
05:56:08.030 --> 05:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
game then you can cooperate if you're
 
05:56:09.788 --> 05:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
not in the game and it's an isolated
 
05:56:10.948 --> 05:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
incident you don't have the connections
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
to work if that's involved does that
 
05:56:15.150 --> 05:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
usually uh kind of hinder their ability
 
05:56:17.830 --> 05:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
to continue with their course of
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
business well it depend depends on how
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
the cooperation agreement working what
 
05:56:22.990 --> 05:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying is when a person's
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
facing a mandatory sentence or you know
 
05:56:29.708 --> 05:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
a you know strong penalty that is one
 
05:56:32.430 --> 05:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
tool that law enforcement does use to
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
get their in you know to get an
 
05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
informant and that's how they go up up
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
the ladder so when you talk about those
 
05:56:40.830 --> 05:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
larger uh drug operations to get to that
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
point it Lui starts lower down the
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:53.230 --> 05:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
you one question I mean you're your bill
 
05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
I mean we seem to be defining a drug
 
05:56:59.390 --> 05:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
dealer by the amount of drugs that they
 
05:57:00.910 --> 05:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
happen to be caught with on their person
 
05:57:04.350 --> 05:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
isn't it more complicated than
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
that well it's an legal drug the person
 
05:57:12.270 --> 05:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
has 2,000 to 2500 doses on them that's
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
can be a lethal amount if the person's
 
05:57:17.070 --> 05:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
just simply an addict I mean they're
 
05:57:20.350 --> 05:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
buying in bulk for how long now it seems
 
05:57:22.350 --> 05:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
to me that that when someone buys in
 
05:57:25.110 --> 05:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
that large quantity you can use that as
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
a presumption to assume that it's one
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
you know intent to distributed you can
 
05:57:30.468 --> 05:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
use it as a presumption
 
05:57:32.868 --> 05:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
to assume a lot of
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
things and I think in this case if you
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
have that large of a Quant
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh it it's it's implying that you're
 
05:57:42.590 --> 05:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
beyond just a simple addict I understand
 
05:57:44.110 --> 05:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
that it's not you can't I don't think
 
05:57:46.590 --> 05:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's fair to compare that to other drugs
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
or you know if someone has a large
 
05:57:49.468 --> 05:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
amount of marijuana like they have like
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
a half a pound some people buy in bulk I
 
05:57:53.948 --> 05:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
guess but even then they can you can
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that the person's
 
05:57:59.468 --> 05:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
dealing that illegally it's it's how
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's packaged can often lead to that
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
assumption as well but again when you
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
have that many doses I mean that's an
 
05:58:08.310 --> 05:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly high amount I I mean if
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's an addict I they can explain why
 
05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
they have that much on them they L don't
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't go out and buy that much because
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
too follow up yeah if
 
05:58:27.510 --> 05:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
the so one of the things about mandatory
 
05:58:30.510 --> 05:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
minimum laws is they don't give judges a
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
great deal of of discretion when it
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
comes to things like that so it would
 
05:58:38.310 --> 05:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
seemed that just the very fact that you
 
05:58:41.468 --> 05:58:41.478 align:start position:0%
had that amount of drugs that were
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
connected with you connected with you in
 
05:58:46.030 --> 05:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
evidence is just primacia evidence of
 
05:58:50.190 --> 05:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
the fact of your guilt so does anything
 
05:58:53.390 --> 05:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
else come into play in in a situation
 
05:58:54.670 --> 05:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
like that I mean you're a defense
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
attorney how would you defend somebody
 
05:59:00.468 --> 05:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
if they had over five grams on them yeah
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
how would you do it well the search and
 
05:59:04.468 --> 05:59:04.478 align:start position:0%
seizure is usually the best best way to
 
05:59:06.628 --> 05:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
go about then if that's lawfully and the
 
05:59:10.190 --> 05:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
test comes back as it
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
is you know sometimes you got to it's
 
05:59:16.350 --> 05:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
what it is Johnny CER himself would uh
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
run into a a wall if that's the case so
 
05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
no defense I didn't say there's no
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
defense what I'm what I'm possession
 
05:59:25.350 --> 05:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
also matters where they found it so
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's say it's in the car you can defend
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
it other ways but if it's in their
 
05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
pocket and and the search is
 
05:59:33.670 --> 05:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional and it exceeds that
 
05:59:35.548 --> 05:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
amount I mean there's only so much you
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
can do
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
beg for
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
mercy argue for Mid gain circum try to
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
get him into diversion program that's
 
05:59:44.270 --> 05:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's the next step but you can't make
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
something on no nothing but when it
 
05:59:48.350 --> 05:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
comes to this mandatory I just I guess
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out if you don't
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
think a mandatory sentence is
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate what is a person doing with
 
05:59:54.670 --> 05:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
that much
 
05:59:57.430 --> 05:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and without facing any type of
 
05:59:59.468 --> 05:59:59.478 align:start position:0%
harsh or penalty do you understand that
 
06:00:00.910 --> 06:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
fentanyl on this table if there was
 
06:00:02.468 --> 06:00:02.478 align:start position:0%
fentanyl on this table and I touched it
 
06:00:05.310 --> 06:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
I could overdose simply by just touching
 
06:00:07.190 --> 06:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
it inadvertently
 
06:00:10.670 --> 06:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
so that's an incredibly large amount
 
06:00:12.468 --> 06:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
that no one should have on their
 
06:00:14.830 --> 06:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
possession period never mind even if
 
06:00:16.910 --> 06:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
you're just an addict that is ill
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
advised on every level thank
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
you follow thank you madam chair I'm
 
06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
going to follow up to representative
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
Muse uh if you're in a situation that
 
06:00:28.430 --> 06:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
you just described and you're the
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
defense Council that's where you would
 
06:00:32.910 --> 06:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
hope to try to negotiate with the
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for plea deal which would
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
take the mandatory sentencing off off
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
the table at that level correct I I
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly try especially knowing
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the you know knowing I'm an uphill
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
battle I mean again sometimes you file
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
that motion and before it's ruled on
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's Sometimes the best way to you
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
know work things out um there's a
 
06:00:52.750 --> 06:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
there's again there's so many things
 
06:00:54.910 --> 06:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
that go into that and again you know the
 
06:00:57.150 --> 06:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
person's background you know the prior
 
06:00:59.468 --> 06:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
history again they may have had six
 
06:01:03.548 --> 06:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
grams or 52 grams but if they had 27 gr
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's more even though it's
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
the same offense it still agreed just
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
that would that's what you would have to
 
06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
do I mean you reach a point where
 
06:01:13.230 --> 06:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
there's only so much you can do on a
 
06:01:15.150 --> 06:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
possession case and just to follow up
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
the prosecuting attorney would have some
 
06:01:20.310 --> 06:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
discretion on offering a plea deal yes
 
06:01:20.320 --> 06:01:24.910 align:start position:0%
discretion on offering a plea deal yes
thank

06:01:24.910 --> 06:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.948 --> 06:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:54.430 --> 06:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.708 --> 06:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
chaffy you sorry about that again my
 
06:01:58.110 --> 06:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
name is Devon chaffy and I'm the
 
06:02:00.350 --> 06:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
executive director of the American civil
 
06:02:02.350 --> 06:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
liberties Union and I am here to testify
 
06:02:06.510 --> 06:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
an opposition to SB uh 415 which creates
 
06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums for certain fentanyl
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
related offenses um and I want to take
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
this opportunity here um to really dig
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
in a little bit further into why New
 
06:02:20.190 --> 06:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law has is generally does not
 
06:02:22.468 --> 06:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
include mandatory minimums especially
 
06:02:24.990 --> 06:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
for drug related cases um here in New
 
06:02:27.670 --> 06:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as I I stated earlier this
 
06:02:30.270 --> 06:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
is because they are expensive they are a
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all approach to justice
 
06:02:34.110 --> 06:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
that fail to take into account the
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
particulars of a given case
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
they transfer judicial discretion away
 
06:02:40.990 --> 06:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary to
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and perhaps most importantly
 
06:02:45.788 --> 06:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
they don't work we have been down this
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
road previously we know that they don't
 
06:02:49.948 --> 06:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
work the data is
 
06:02:55.468 --> 06:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
in um I want to uh start by um just
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
elaborating a little bit more on the
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost that mandatory minimums
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
put on taxpayers and would begin to put
 
06:03:04.590 --> 06:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayers of New Hampshire if New
 
06:03:06.910 --> 06:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to go down Road of
 
06:03:09.868 --> 06:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
leaning towards mandatory minimums and
 
06:03:11.948 --> 06:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
in doing so I want to quote Grover
 
06:03:14.350 --> 06:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
norquist which is interesting for a
 
06:03:17.510 --> 06:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative of the ACLU to be quoting
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
um for those of you um who may be young
 
06:03:21.868 --> 06:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
and and do not know he was a longtime
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
tax reduction Advocate and a founder of
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
Americans for tax reform and Grover
 
06:03:29.390 --> 06:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
norquist has stated that the biggest
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
problem from the P perspective of the
 
06:03:34.030 --> 06:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is that mandatory minimum
 
06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing policies have proven
 
06:03:39.270 --> 06:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expenses he went on to
 
06:03:40.910 --> 06:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
cite the skyrocketing cost of
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
incarceration to American taxpayers
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
saying that this explosion and cost is
 
06:03:47.868 --> 06:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
driven by the expanded use of prison
 
06:03:50.270 --> 06:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
sentences for drug crimes and longer
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
sentences required by mandatory
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
minimums and he stated that it appears
 
06:03:57.670 --> 06:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
that mandatory minimums have become a
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
sort of poor man's
 
06:04:03.030 --> 06:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition a grossly simplistic
 
06:04:05.788 --> 06:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
ineffectual government response to a
 
06:04:07.468 --> 06:04:07.478 align:start position:0%
problem that has been around longer than
 
06:04:09.948 --> 06:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
our government itself and viewed through
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
the skeptical eye that I train on all
 
06:04:14.788 --> 06:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
other government programs I have
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
concluded that mandatory minimum
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
sentencing policies are not worth the
 
06:04:22.468 --> 06:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
high tax to Americans
 
06:04:25.150 --> 06:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so I would just put put to
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
you that you know we we have been down
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
this road before we know that mandatory
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
minimums do not work and they are not
 
06:04:34.390 --> 06:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
they come at a very high cost to the
 
06:04:36.430 --> 06:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
state and to the New Hampshire
 
06:04:38.788 --> 06:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as has been discussed they
 
06:04:41.590 --> 06:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
also take discretion away from judges
 
06:04:44.190 --> 06:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
and they give it to prosecutors now this
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
has been described at how this happens
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
by um some of the defense attorneys
 
06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
behind me but I want to also put forward
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
that this issue of taking power away
 
06:04:55.750 --> 06:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch and giving it
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the executive branch through
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums actually has
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional concerns as well
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
separation of powers concerns and here
 
06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to quotee David Kean who's a
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
prominent gun rights Advocate and was an
 
06:05:12.830 --> 06:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
adviser to the George HW Bush
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
Administration and David Keane stated
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
that my opposition to mandatory minimums
 
06:05:20.830 --> 06:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
is rooted in conservative principles
 
06:05:23.468 --> 06:05:23.478 align:start position:0%
namely reverence for the Constitution
 
06:05:25.468 --> 06:05:25.478 align:start position:0%
and contempt for government action that
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
ignores the differences among
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
individuals James Madison for one
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
believed that a clear separation of
 
06:05:34.350 --> 06:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
powers was more vital to protecting
 
06:05:36.190 --> 06:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
freedom than the Bill of Rights
 
06:05:38.590 --> 06:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
yet mandatory minimums undermine this
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
important protector of Liberty the
 
06:05:43.350 --> 06:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
attempt by legislators to address
 
06:05:45.230 --> 06:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
proceed problems in the justice system
 
06:05:48.190 --> 06:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
by transferring power from judges to
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and the executive B Branch
 
06:05:53.310 --> 06:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
violate these principles and have in the
 
06:05:56.350 --> 06:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
process given prosecutors unreviewable
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
authority to influence sentencing
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
through their charging decisions and
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
power addition Al I want to flag that
 
06:06:08.558 --> 06:06:10.190 align:start position:0%
power addition Al I want to flag that
mandatory

06:06:10.190 --> 06:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
minimums do not work we have seen them
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
we have seen them in in in play
 
06:06:18.468 --> 06:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
previously whether it be in this state
 
06:06:20.910 --> 06:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
and across the C the country and we know
 
06:06:23.510 --> 06:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that aside from anecdotal accounts there
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
is no statistical evidence and I will
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
note none that was cited by the sponsor
 
06:06:30.830 --> 06:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
or the the the senator who introduced
 
06:06:34.150 --> 06:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill no evidence despite Decades of
 
06:06:36.990 --> 06:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
experience with mandatory minimums that
 
06:06:40.830 --> 06:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
they that they um have any significant
 
06:06:43.750 --> 06:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
relationship to reducing crime or
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
reducing drug use and in fact in a 50
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
state study found that there was no
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
relationship between drug
 
06:06:54.670 --> 06:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
sentencing and three drug epidemic
 
06:06:57.310 --> 06:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
indicators elicit drug use drug arrests
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
and overdose rates so we do not see
 
06:07:03.628 --> 06:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums having any impact
 
06:07:06.708 --> 06:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on crime rates drug drug use
 
06:07:09.468 --> 06:07:09.478 align:start position:0%
um or or um or
 
06:07:12.190 --> 06:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
overdoses moreover mandatory minimums
 
06:07:14.350 --> 06:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
may actually increase the likelihood of
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
recidivism because harsh mandatory
 
06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
minimum penalties serve to increase the
 
06:07:20.548 --> 06:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
length of time in prison and Studies
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
have noted that there is a relationship
 
06:07:25.510 --> 06:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
between longer stays and recidivism and
 
06:07:27.670 --> 06:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I respectfully request
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the committee um uh recommends HB
 
06:07:35.350 --> 06:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
415 uh in expedient to legislate thank
 
06:07:37.750 --> 06:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
06:07:40.430 --> 06:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
Pratt in response to that I have a
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
question do you think somebody sitting
 
06:07:46.190 --> 06:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
in jail for 10 years can kill somebody
 
06:07:49.070 --> 06:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
by giving them a drug dose I'm sorry sir
 
06:07:50.510 --> 06:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not sure I understand question
 
06:07:52.270 --> 06:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
so if somebody is sitting in jail for 10
 
06:07:54.830 --> 06:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
years from a mandatory sentence do you
 
06:07:56.590 --> 06:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
believe they can kill somebody by giving
 
06:07:59.628 --> 06:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
them more drugs what I have seen what I
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
do know and what I have seen through the
 
06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
data and the analysis that has have been
 
06:08:07.310 --> 06:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
done is that there is no demonstrated
 
06:08:09.708 --> 06:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
data that mandatory minimums actually
 
06:08:12.430 --> 06:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
reduce drug overdoses and that's just
 
06:08:14.430 --> 06:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
that's the evidence that we have seen
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
and that is why States like New
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have shifted away from
 
06:08:20.070 --> 06:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums as a way to address
 
06:08:21.990 --> 06:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
the drug crisis in our state so that
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer my question so the person
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's sitting in jail can they now sell
 
06:08:28.708 --> 06:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
another lethal dose to another kid I
 
06:08:30.750 --> 06:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe so unless they have access
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
to those unless they have access within
 
06:08:36.990 --> 06:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
our facilities thank you thank
 
06:08:40.030 --> 06:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
you let's just not argue with our people
 
06:08:43.390 --> 06:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
that are testifying please I I I know
 
06:08:44.670 --> 06:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
but let's be very careful we're going
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
down a slippery slope thank you
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative are there any other
 
06:08:52.590 --> 06:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:52.600 --> 06:09:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
much

06:09:01.230 --> 06:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
Burns good afternoon again and thank you
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the to speak I want to
 
06:09:09.070 --> 06:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate all of the points and I and in
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the interest of time I I'm not going to
 
06:09:13.548 --> 06:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
sit up here and repeat all of them as
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of my points that I made
 
06:09:17.948 --> 06:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
about SP 414 are the same for S
 
06:09:21.310 --> 06:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
sp415 but I do want to look at the
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
dehumanization of of the people that we
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
work with and that the people this
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
targets because with all due respect to
 
06:09:30.510 --> 06:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
the senator that presented um the
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
sponsorship on this legislation he stood
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
up here and referred to people who use
 
06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
drugs and people in recovery as addicts
 
06:09:41.708 --> 06:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
which is a very stigmatizing term um and
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
this is the strategy that's often used
 
06:09:47.310 --> 06:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement and drug policy is to
 
06:09:49.708 --> 06:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
dehumanize people demonize them label
 
06:09:52.270 --> 06:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
them um my daughter is not you know he
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
used the term simple addict versus
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
people who have five grams and I work
 
06:09:59.628 --> 06:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
with these people every day and there
 
06:10:03.030 --> 06:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot more than that um and it is
 
06:10:04.910 --> 06:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
not unusual to see people with those
 
06:10:08.070 --> 06:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
quantities and I think you know talking
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
about .1 you know 1 milligram being a
 
06:10:12.990 --> 06:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
deadly dose the reality is you know when
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
we look at street level front lines um
 
06:10:18.230 --> 06:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
some of his testimony was out of touch
 
06:10:21.390 --> 06:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
with what I see so on average to give
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
some education on that what we usually
 
06:10:26.350 --> 06:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
see are what we call 20 bags 40 bags
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
occasionally people buy it by the gram
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
um or higher level as a as a finger
 
06:10:33.030 --> 06:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
what's called a finger on the streets
 
06:10:35.468 --> 06:10:35.478 align:start position:0%
which is 7 to 10 gr um depending on
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
where you're at um the street value of
 
06:10:41.310 --> 06:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
five GS generally runs $400 to $500 so
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about massive
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
quantities here and it's not hard for
 
06:10:48.910 --> 06:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
somebody with four or five friends using
 
06:10:52.350 --> 06:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
drugs to grab that to to pull together
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
that much money um and face a three and
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
a half year mandatory minimum as a
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
result now with this
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
legislation um and again kind of what I
 
06:11:03.390 --> 06:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
said before with the licenses but I also
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to remind this committee that when
 
06:11:07.948 --> 06:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
talking about these people these are our
 
06:11:10.990 --> 06:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
kids these are our friends like not
 
06:11:13.230 --> 06:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
everybody contrary to what the media
 
06:11:16.190 --> 06:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
portrays these aren't all under bridges
 
06:11:17.310 --> 06:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
these are people who are in our
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
workforces these are people who are
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
functioning often times that are that
 
06:11:24.750 --> 06:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
are in that are being prosecuted around
 
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
this um and and often we've we've heard
 
06:11:30.990 --> 06:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
the stories numerous times these are
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
people who may have had an injury and
 
06:11:35.788 --> 06:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
were prescribed opioids and and this led
 
06:11:37.468 --> 06:11:37.478 align:start position:0%
to this like we we know how this
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
epidemic started and it and it and it
 
06:11:42.030 --> 06:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
impacts people that look just like us in
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
this room all across the state and those
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
are the individuals that are going to be
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
targeted with this law and those are the
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
people that are going to be locked up
 
06:11:52.390 --> 06:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
for three and a half years without you
 
06:11:54.990 --> 06:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
know and I think when we look at the
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
balance of power with judicial
 
06:11:59.788 --> 06:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
discretion too I think often these laws
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
are misdirected and end up coming after
 
06:12:04.830 --> 06:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
the people that we don't intend them to
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
so the big fish so to speak go in front
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
of a you get arrested and they tend to
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
be talked into flipping on a couple of
 
06:12:17.070 --> 06:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
their of their smaller fish and those
 
06:12:18.750 --> 06:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
smaller fish are the ones that end up
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
facing a mandatory minimum of three
 
06:12:23.110 --> 06:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
years while the the larger fish that we
 
06:12:25.910 --> 06:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
had hoped to Target with these laws run
 
06:12:28.110 --> 06:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
off as a criminal you know they'll be a
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
they might be a CI for a period of time
 
06:12:33.510 --> 06:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
um face less consequences well the
 
06:12:35.788 --> 06:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
people that have less resources
 
06:12:38.430 --> 06:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
to to get the representation they need
 
06:12:40.510 --> 06:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
are targeted in this so often times you
 
06:12:42.350 --> 06:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
know as I say if somebody's involved
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
with a cartel that we're trying to
 
06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
Target here chances are they're not
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
touching the drugs and they're not in
 
06:12:51.150 --> 06:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cuz it's it's those make
 
06:12:53.230 --> 06:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
fish they don't come into contact when
 
06:12:54.788 --> 06:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at street level
 
06:12:56.910 --> 06:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
dealing and most of the most of these
 
06:12:58.708 --> 06:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
most of the people that I see that are
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
dealing in quantities of this nature are
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
people just like us who have struggled
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
with the substance disorder and are
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
actively using and they're sharing it
 
06:13:08.990 --> 06:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
with their friends so I just want to
 
06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate those points and realize that
 
06:13:14.830 --> 06:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here are not
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
grizzled criminal cartel members these
 
06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
are these are people in our community um
 
06:13:22.110 --> 06:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
these are my people like my daughter
 
06:13:23.788 --> 06:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
people like the people I work with every
 
06:13:26.270 --> 06:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
single day in Rochester do and Hampton
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
um those are the ones who are going to
 
06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
be locked up in a prison cell for three
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
and a half years without the opportunity
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
to go to treatment Court without the
 
06:13:35.190 --> 06:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive diversion without
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have any sort of
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
support for a substance use disorder
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
which should be looked at as a
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare issue not a criminal justice
 
06:13:45.230 --> 06:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
issue I don't know when we walked away
 
06:13:47.310 --> 06:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
from the we can't arrest our way out of
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
this notion um but it's really
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunate to see the pendulum swinging
 
06:13:54.110 --> 06:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
this way and you know and again and
 
06:13:55.468 --> 06:13:55.478 align:start position:0%
representative proud if I could just
 
06:13:57.750 --> 06:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
respond to yes absolutely if somebody's
 
06:13:59.468 --> 06:13:59.478 align:start position:0%
locked up for 10 years in a prison they
 
06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
can they will they are still going to
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to sell drugs
 
06:14:03.468 --> 06:14:03.478 align:start position:0%
because there's an entire Underground
 
06:14:05.430 --> 06:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
Market in every prison and every jail
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
that I've ever seen in in all of my work
 
06:14:09.390 --> 06:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a Statewide criminal justice
 
06:14:11.590 --> 06:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
program so unfortunately you know drugs
 
06:14:13.868 --> 06:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
get into prisons too and so we're not
 
06:14:15.948 --> 06:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
keeping any sort of uh trafficking
 
06:14:18.390 --> 06:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
outside of prisons and I'm sure most of
 
06:14:20.670 --> 06:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
the correctional Department would attest
 
06:14:22.150 --> 06:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
to the fact that they struggle with this
 
06:14:23.708 --> 06:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
that's why we have overdoses in prisons
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're getting the
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Burns do we have any
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.360 --> 06:14:48.750 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:51.110 --> 06:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
Summers good afternoon again thank you
 
06:14:53.628 --> 06:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
very much for the opportunity to testify
 
06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
Vice chairperson rhs and honorable
 
06:14:57.708 --> 06:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I think um in
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony today we can
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
all agree that um we want to rid our
 
06:15:05.948 --> 06:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
state of dealers
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
and suppliers the big fish so to speak
 
06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh opioid supply chain I
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
want to um though make a couple points
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
one when I reviewed the uh bill as it's
 
06:15:22.110 --> 06:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
written I noted what I consider to be an
 
06:15:24.390 --> 06:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in section one under the
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
controlled act penalties it cites 5
 
06:15:30.110 --> 06:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
ounces or more of a mixture or substance
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
containing any of the following
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
including adulterants or dilutant a
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
cocoa leaf accept cocoa leaves and
 
06:15:37.948 --> 06:15:37.958 align:start position:0%
extracts of cocoa leaves from which
 
06:15:40.830 --> 06:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
cocaine echine and derivatives of echine
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
or other salts have been removed or B
 
06:15:44.868 --> 06:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
cocaine other than crack cocaine it
 
06:15:47.350 --> 06:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
salts Optical and geometric isomers and
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
salt of isomers C echinus derivatives or
 
06:15:53.468 --> 06:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
salts isomers and salts of isomers and
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
it goes on to spell out this the amount
 
06:15:58.990 --> 06:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
or the threshold amount for L surgic
 
06:16:02.468 --> 06:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
acid diamide which is LSD and PCP and
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
then it talks about heroin or it
 
06:16:06.270 --> 06:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
describes heroin it's analog crack
 
06:16:08.590 --> 06:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
cocaine with crack cocaine which for the
 
06:16:10.150 --> 06:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
record is a mistake crack cocaine
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
obviously is not an not an analog of
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
crack cocaine of of U fentanyl excuse me
 
06:16:17.868 --> 06:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to call to to call to the
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
attention that in my experience in the
 
06:16:23.070 --> 06:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
subus treatment uh world for the past
 
06:16:24.948 --> 06:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
two decades I've never known anyone who
 
06:16:28.030 --> 06:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
consumes 5 ounces of cocaine and
 
06:16:29.830 --> 06:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
survives I I know a lot of cocaine
 
06:16:32.310 --> 06:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
addicts but that is an extreme amount
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
that would suggest it comes from a
 
06:16:36.990 --> 06:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
direct dealer I would ask you compare
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
that to the amount of fentanyl that's
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
cited here which is 5 G and I understand
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony that 5 G might might be as
 
06:16:47.548 --> 06:16:47.558 align:start position:0%
much as 200 to 250 lethal doses but the
 
06:16:50.150 --> 06:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
scientific me the scientific L
 
06:16:53.548 --> 06:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
literature is replete with how quickly
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
an individual becomes addicted and
 
06:16:59.110 --> 06:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
dependent physically on opioids it
 
06:17:01.070 --> 06:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
occurs for some people in a matter of
 
06:17:02.670 --> 06:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
days but for everyone else in a matter
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
of two or 3 weeks they escalate the dose
 
06:17:10.310 --> 06:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
the people using five Gs are not dealers
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
these are people like you and me people
 
06:17:15.230 --> 06:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
who might have been prescribed per
 
06:17:17.190 --> 06:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
cassette or deloted for a pain problem
 
06:17:21.070 --> 06:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
from their PCP and then went on to
 
06:17:23.708 --> 06:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
somehow access illegal
 
06:17:26.708 --> 06:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
opioids so I ask you to consider that
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's a bifurcation in this law that
 
06:17:31.708 --> 06:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
we're looking one at quantities and then
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at penalties and I would
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
suggest to this committee to please
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
please if we're going to keep this
 
06:17:40.830 --> 06:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to at the very least
 
06:17:42.868 --> 06:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
increase the amount in fentanyl of it
 
06:17:46.030 --> 06:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
and its analoges to at least what uh is
 
06:17:49.230 --> 06:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
cited in cocaine which is 5 ounces 5
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
ounces is um
 
06:17:54.628 --> 06:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
120 uh grams and for the record on my
 
06:17:58.270 --> 06:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony I talked uh to um
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt earlier the
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
statistic I CED was 32.3 deaths per
 
06:18:05.948 --> 06:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
100,000 in New Hampshire when I was
 
06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
describing overdose deaths and I'll also
 
06:18:11.070 --> 06:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
state that any overdose death is too
 
06:18:14.510 --> 06:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
many but I would ask that we look at the
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
amount here because if we keep it at
 
06:18:20.830 --> 06:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
five grams we're going to incarcerate a
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
whole lot of citizens who are like you
 
06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
and me who shouldn't be in jail who are
 
06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to cost us in excess of hundreds
 
06:18:30.070 --> 06:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
of that millions of dollars in prison
 
06:18:33.670 --> 06:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
and jail jail cost and I think it's also
 
06:18:35.390 --> 06:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
important as
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
John Burns described earlier to remember
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
the human in this equation this is not
 
06:18:43.150 --> 06:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
the stereotypical quote junkie unquote
 
06:18:44.350 --> 06:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
on the side of the street living
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
homeless these are people like you and
 
06:18:48.430 --> 06:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
me who are going to suffer the
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
consequences they already are suffering
 
06:18:52.468 --> 06:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
the consequences there's no one that
 
06:18:54.190 --> 06:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
I've come across in my 20-year career in
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the submis used addiction treatment
 
06:18:58.190 --> 06:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
field when I've asked him this question
 
06:19:00.110 --> 06:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
hey did you want to grow up to become an
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol or addict that that's responded
 
06:19:05.110 --> 06:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
affirmatively when someone isn't an
 
06:19:07.868 --> 06:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
addict bition goes out the window it's
 
06:19:10.190 --> 06:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
no there's no longer a choice to use the
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
substance and I think that point really
 
06:19:15.070 --> 06:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
needs to resonate with this committee
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
people who are actively using no longer
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
have a choice there is Treatment
 
06:19:22.510 --> 06:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
available there are modalities including
 
06:19:25.468 --> 06:19:25.478 align:start position:0%
harm reduction peer support services
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment but the
 
06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
choice goes out the window so instead of
 
06:19:33.548 --> 06:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
putting people who otherwise have led
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
Sterling lives but have off have an
 
06:19:41.910 --> 06:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
intractable subtit disorder in jail
 
06:19:43.830 --> 06:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
please consider the consequences at
 
06:19:46.350 --> 06:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
least with the amount cited for Fentanyl
 
06:19:48.510 --> 06:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
and its analoges and again I would
 
06:19:51.070 --> 06:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that the the
 
06:19:53.230 --> 06:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
committee opposed mandatory sentencing
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
minimums which we know from the data has
 
06:19:58.548 --> 06:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
done nothing to keep our community safer
 
06:19:58.558 --> 06:20:02.350 align:start position:0%
done nothing to keep our community safer
thank

06:20:02.350 --> 06:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.230 --> 06:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr are you okay to take a question
 
06:20:09.230 --> 06:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.110 --> 06:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
Newman based on your comment about how
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the um the amount should be in
 
06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
increased um do you have any comment
 
06:20:20.670 --> 06:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
about the uh including any adulterant in
 
06:20:24.030 --> 06:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
delut since it seems like we can't tell
 
06:20:26.350 --> 06:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
very well what the quantity of actual
 
06:20:28.110 --> 06:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
fanol is in
 
06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
there that's a that's a very pertinent
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
question I think um it's
 
06:20:37.868 --> 06:20:37.878 align:start position:0%
as far as we're concerned at the street
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
level what what's being sold for
 
06:20:42.670 --> 06:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is believed to be fentanyl so
 
06:20:45.868 --> 06:20:45.878 align:start position:0%
the entire substance including
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
adulterant is 120 grams I would be okay
 
06:20:51.230 --> 06:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
with that in the
 
06:20:56.910 --> 06:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:00.468 --> 06:21:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:03.548 --> 06:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
much Dr
 
06:21:03.558 --> 06:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
much Dr
Hannon

06:21:16.310 --> 06:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Joe Hannon and I stand in
 
06:21:22.468 --> 06:21:22.478 align:start position:0%
opposition to SB 415 uh I'm not going to
 
06:21:24.310 --> 06:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
repeat uh all the things that I've heard
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
that I I absolutely agree with uh I
 
06:21:28.070 --> 06:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
think it's an egregious dangerous uh
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
thing but there were a couple little
 
06:21:30.510 --> 06:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
points that I I thought of as other
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
people were speaking that I I thought
 
06:21:34.628 --> 06:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
I'd draw your attention to um you you
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
know the the idea that just because
 
06:21:38.030 --> 06:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
someone has an amount that is a lethal
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
amount or more than the average user
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
amount I mean we only look at that in
 
06:21:43.430 --> 06:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
terms of drugs you can buy a truckload
 
06:21:44.868 --> 06:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
of alcohol at the state liquor stores
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
you can buy U 20 cartons of cigarettes
 
06:21:49.270 --> 06:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's totally legal these are very
 
06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous amounts to have but people
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't do that just um because they're
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
dealing I during covid I mean I'm sure
 
06:21:56.868 --> 06:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not alone people out here ran out
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
and bought toilet paper I still have
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
some left because I'm not a toilet paper
 
06:22:01.948 --> 06:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
dealer I bought what I thought would be
 
06:22:04.548 --> 06:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
enough to get me through the crisis now
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
people that are homeless or people that
 
06:22:07.788 --> 06:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
are not homeless who have a job who are
 
06:22:10.110 --> 06:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
working and using elicit substances they
 
06:22:11.948 --> 06:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
may buy larger quantities to get through
 
06:22:14.110 --> 06:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
longer periods of time I have to drive
 
06:22:16.190 --> 06:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
30 minutes to get to the dentist and 25
 
06:22:18.110 --> 06:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
minutes to get a haircut in this state
 
06:22:19.948 --> 06:22:19.958 align:start position:0%
you know so and I have a car you know
 
06:22:21.390 --> 06:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
what if someone doesn't it's very
 
06:22:22.468 --> 06:22:22.478 align:start position:0%
difficult if you're living in a in a
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
camp somewhere or in a shelter it's very
 
06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to go to do that on
 
06:22:28.868 --> 06:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
a regular basis and the idea that even
 
06:22:31.150 --> 06:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
touching it is is lethal and dangerous
 
06:22:33.468 --> 06:22:33.478 align:start position:0%
it is a myth it has been debunked
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
numerous times by medical professionals
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
um and it is completely false even if
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
you use a fentanyl patch which is the
 
06:22:43.150 --> 06:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
designed method of transporting it
 
06:22:45.548 --> 06:22:45.558 align:start position:0%
through the skin transdermally if I put
 
06:22:47.788 --> 06:22:47.798 align:start position:0%
a Fenty patch put 10 of them on my arm
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
and sat here for 5 10 minutes I probably
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even get that much of an effect
 
06:22:53.590 --> 06:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
from it after a few minutes you have to
 
06:22:56.190 --> 06:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
leave it on for hours even with many
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
hour several hours to get the effect
 
06:23:00.590 --> 06:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's a slow release thing uh if you put
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
it on your skin it doesn't go through
 
06:23:05.310 --> 06:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
your skin period it does not happen so
 
06:23:06.670 --> 06:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
every time you've seen an incident or of
 
06:23:08.350 --> 06:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
a police officer who is you know they
 
06:23:10.110 --> 06:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
touched their hand and they fell down
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
they've never found Fen on their systems
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
when they've drug tested them or check
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
them in in for anything else it's
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
usually a fainting reaction or someone
 
06:23:18.350 --> 06:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
who's been so scared the reason why I
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
bring this up is important is it doesn't
 
06:23:21.910 --> 06:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
pertain directly to the bill but I think
 
06:23:24.110 --> 06:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
it goes to the the stigmatizing effect
 
06:23:26.750 --> 06:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation like this has and the
 
06:23:29.628 --> 06:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
conversations that go on around drug use
 
06:23:31.468 --> 06:23:31.478 align:start position:0%
when someone is scared of even touching
 
06:23:33.830 --> 06:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
fentanyl for fear of death the chance of
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
someone surviving a drug overdose
 
06:23:38.270 --> 06:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
because someone is scared they may touch
 
06:23:39.910 --> 06:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
fentanyl if they go near that person or
 
06:23:41.628 --> 06:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
do mouth to mouth or even touch their
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
skin they're afraid to to do that if
 
06:23:47.070 --> 06:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're afraid the longer it takes to uh
 
06:23:48.350 --> 06:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
the longer you wait to reverse an
 
06:23:50.990 --> 06:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
overdose the more dangerous and and
 
06:23:52.708 --> 06:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
lethal that becomes so we don't want
 
06:23:54.708 --> 06:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
people to be afraid I'm not saying you
 
06:23:55.910 --> 06:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
should go around and just smear it all
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
over your body it's probably not you
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
know financially advisable at least but
 
06:24:01.750 --> 06:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
I think that it's dangerous to have
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
these talks that uh it's so bad that we
 
06:24:05.670 --> 06:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
have to take the these people and they
 
06:24:07.350 --> 06:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
have to mandatorily do the sentence
 
06:24:09.430 --> 06:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of the circumstances uh
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
there's very few things we do this with
 
06:24:12.190 --> 06:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
if we do this we'll have people serving
 
06:24:13.468 --> 06:24:13.478 align:start position:0%
more time than if they committed
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
manslaughter or U vehicular homicide in
 
06:24:18.230 --> 06:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
some places this is not something that
 
06:24:20.030 --> 06:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
we want to go down that road it's a
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer for prosecutors this is my
 
06:24:23.590 --> 06:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
last Point uh we're taking that power
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
like you've heard away from the judicial
 
06:24:26.270 --> 06:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
branch and giving to the Executive
 
06:24:28.350 --> 06:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
Branch the prosecutors can now use this
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
to coers people to take a deal and we
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
know that most people don't even go to
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
trial most people that get uh prosecuted
 
06:24:36.310 --> 06:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
or take a plea deal if everyone that
 
06:24:37.468 --> 06:24:37.478 align:start position:0%
took a plea deal everyone that got
 
06:24:39.070 --> 06:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
prosecuted took a plea deal did not take
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
a plea deal and decided on a jury trial
 
06:24:42.510 --> 06:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
our system would shut down because we
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources for everyone to
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
go to trial but um when someone takes a
 
06:24:49.590 --> 06:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
plea deal they may not even be guilty in
 
06:24:50.868 --> 06:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
some instances they're just afraid of
 
06:24:52.590 --> 06:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
have oh I could you know I could do 40
 
06:24:54.310 --> 06:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know 90 days or six months for what
 
06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
I might have done but now they're
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
throwing this potential mandatory
 
06:24:59.310 --> 06:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
minimum charge and I'm going to have to
 
06:25:01.948 --> 06:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
go to jail for mandatory sentence and
 
06:25:05.030 --> 06:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
they just take a plea now they some may
 
06:25:06.750 --> 06:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
say that's in the interest of justice
 
06:25:08.628 --> 06:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
but you know we're we're taking someone
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
who may have been able to get out on
 
06:25:11.510 --> 06:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
something easier and had a better life
 
06:25:13.868 --> 06:25:13.878 align:start position:0%
also the longer someone's incarcerated
 
06:25:15.990 --> 06:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know incarceration is Creo
 
06:25:17.430 --> 06:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
criminogenic if I'm saying that
 
06:25:19.270 --> 06:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the longer someone's in jail
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
the more likely they are to to live a
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
life of crime you know people that are
 
06:25:24.030 --> 06:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
in for 10 20 years they don't just get
 
06:25:25.708 --> 06:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
out and start teaching school and Sunday
 
06:25:27.590 --> 06:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
school you know Sunday school and doing
 
06:25:28.910 --> 06:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
community service all the time that's
 
06:25:30.750 --> 06:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
not the norm it happens but it's not the
 
06:25:33.390 --> 06:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
norm um and the last part of that when
 
06:25:35.310 --> 06:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
the prosecutors coer people into taking
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
plea Deals they often times coers and
 
06:25:39.548 --> 06:25:39.558 align:start position:0%
this is the main uh rationale I've heard
 
06:25:41.110 --> 06:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement I've spoken to is
 
06:25:42.510 --> 06:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
well we want to get the next person up
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
the ladder so we can use this as a plea
 
06:25:47.948 --> 06:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
or a tool to coerce uh either plea
 
06:25:49.468 --> 06:25:49.478 align:start position:0%
bargain or to get someone higher up the
 
06:25:51.430 --> 06:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
chain and that's not always what happens
 
06:25:53.670 --> 06:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you firsthand experience
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
not not firsthand secondhand experience
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
sorry um you know I when I was a State
 
06:26:00.788 --> 06:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
Rep I had uh more than one person uh
 
06:26:04.270 --> 06:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
come to me and say they were a uh forced
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
to be a criminal informant otherwise
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
they had to do these seven you know 15E
 
06:26:11.150 --> 06:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
sentences and they were scared to death
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
I had a someone who worked for me who's
 
06:26:15.948 --> 06:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
had a friend who was in this position
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
and they were scared to death because
 
06:26:19.868 --> 06:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
they were not just asked to you know U
 
06:26:22.670 --> 06:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
tell on you know to to to tell on their
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
Partners or the person they bought the
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
drugs they wanted someone really high at
 
06:26:26.430 --> 06:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
the chain and they kept using this
 
06:26:28.270 --> 06:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
person and using them now you're putting
 
06:26:30.310 --> 06:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
someone in a very dangerous position you
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
know we want to get the big fish
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
apparently I guess no one's uh saying
 
06:26:35.628 --> 06:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
that's not a good idea but we're putting
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
people in danger by doing that and this
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a tool that can make that more of a
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
bludgeon for a prosecutor or law
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement to use to go after people
 
06:26:45.230 --> 06:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
who are maybe low-level offenders who
 
06:26:46.750 --> 06:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
are really just harming themselves but
 
06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
now we're putting their lives in
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy by making them uh testify
 
06:26:51.230 --> 06:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
against someone who may be more
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous and lethal and and also drug
 
06:26:55.628 --> 06:26:55.638 align:start position:0%
dealers like if you lock them all up
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be more you know we don't have a
 
06:26:59.110 --> 06:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
shortage of dealers it's actually every
 
06:27:00.548 --> 06:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
time one gets arrested all you're doing
 
06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
is creating a job opportunity for the
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
next person to move into that area so so
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you know crime's going to go up it
 
06:27:07.948 --> 06:27:07.958 align:start position:0%
did in Florida after Florida crime went
 
06:27:09.430 --> 06:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
up almost 50% in Florida after they
 
06:27:11.788 --> 06:27:11.798 align:start position:0%
instituted mandatory minimums way back
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
so there's no data to support this and
 
06:27:15.310 --> 06:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of data to show that this
 
06:27:17.070 --> 06:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea so I ask you to please
 
06:27:21.948 --> 06:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:24.548 --> 06:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
legislate we're good apparently we're
 
06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
not good representative Newman yeah I
 
06:27:29.110 --> 06:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
just have a question about distribute is
 
06:27:31.510 --> 06:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
my definition of that is just pass
 
06:27:33.510 --> 06:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
around and it's not more complicated
 
06:27:35.990 --> 06:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
than that I'm what you might say to that
 
06:27:38.030 --> 06:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
I mean distribution I mean there's you
 
06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're well aware of this being you know
 
06:27:41.468 --> 06:27:41.478 align:start position:0%
it's um there's difference between
 
06:27:42.990 --> 06:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
actually selling it an intent to
 
06:27:44.910 --> 06:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
distribute um there there was laws on
 
06:27:45.990 --> 06:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
the books that say if it's over this
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
amount then we have an intent to
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
distribute you know um charge but there
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
are people who buy for other people and
 
06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
buy for groups of people you know anyone
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
in here who's ever you know shown up to
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
a party with a bottle of liquor you know
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you drank the whole thing you'd
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
probably be sick might have to get your
 
06:28:01.030 --> 06:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
stomach pumped that doesn't make you a
 
06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
dealer you know are you giving it out
 
06:28:04.990 --> 06:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know I have a friend who has a
 
06:28:06.750 --> 06:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
daughter who is in jail still to this
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
day because she uh bought U substance
 
06:28:11.750 --> 06:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it was I believe it was fentanyl or
 
06:28:14.310 --> 06:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
something related heroin back then and
 
06:28:16.030 --> 06:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh she was using it with her boyfriend
 
06:28:19.150 --> 06:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
they both overdosed and he happened to
 
06:28:21.830 --> 06:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
die she bought it and was just sharing
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
it with the person that gave her you
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
know whatever amount the money was few
 
06:28:27.390 --> 06:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
bucks and because she survived and
 
06:28:29.830 --> 06:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
bought it she got charged with the you
 
06:28:31.948 --> 06:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
know death resulting and she had a long
 
06:28:34.070 --> 06:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
sentence and she was a victim in a sense
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know if he bought it it didn't
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
matter who bought it they both pulled
 
06:28:39.548 --> 06:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
their money if you give me 20 bucks and
 
06:28:40.990 --> 06:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know I take my $20 and I buy
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
something I give it to you is it my
 
06:28:44.350 --> 06:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
fault that something happened to you
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's only a matter of circumstance that
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
I happen to be the one who went and got

06:30:31.628 --> 06:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
District 22 serving the communities pum

Salem a and
 
06:30:32.920 --> 06:30:35.030 align:start position:0%
Salem a and
plastow

06:30:35.030 --> 06:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
plastow
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I am here to introduce Senate
 
06:30:40.190 --> 06:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 316 which by the way I don't want
 
06:30:42.190 --> 06:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
to take too much credit for this
 
06:30:44.830 --> 06:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill so I I know a very wise man
 
06:30:47.708 --> 06:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:49.948 --> 06:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
bill the chair of this
 
06:30:52.030 --> 06:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
committee he wrote it last term and it
 
06:30:53.510 --> 06:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
didn't actually make it out of the house
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping some better luck this year
 
06:31:00.030 --> 06:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
um the chair is not here today but um
 
06:31:01.830 --> 06:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is has to do with possession of
 
06:31:03.590 --> 06:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute fentanyl class
 
06:31:03.600 --> 06:31:04.590 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute fentanyl class
drugs

06:31:04.590 --> 06:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
06:31:05.948 --> 06:31:05.958 align:start position:0%
with the intent to distribute when you
 
06:31:08.030 --> 06:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
import it into the state of New
 
06:31:08.040 --> 06:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
import it into the state of New
Hampshire

06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:31:13.310 --> 06:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
and speaking in general terms about
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
fentanyl I I hear I hear a lot about
 
06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
people's perception of what's going on
 
06:31:21.070 --> 06:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
out there
 
06:31:23.750 --> 06:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
I I guess for someone who's worked with
 
06:31:26.708 --> 06:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
criminals on the ground level some want
 
06:31:29.468 --> 06:31:29.478 align:start position:0%
to get better some are trying some are
 
06:31:32.468 --> 06:31:32.478 align:start position:0%
not and the person that buys drugs and
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
then sells to their friend friends to
 
06:31:37.468 --> 06:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
you know support their habit they're
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
making other people addicts they're
 
06:31:41.190 --> 06:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
contributing to the problem do they have
 
06:31:41.200 --> 06:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
contributing to the problem do they have
a

06:31:42.110 --> 06:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:31:45.030 --> 06:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
disease sure but they're doing anything
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
to help themselves no and they're making
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
it worse for other people around them
 
06:31:50.990 --> 06:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that they contributing to that
 
06:31:52.590 --> 06:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
problem they're funding the market all
 
06:31:54.510 --> 06:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
that well this fentanyl is not made in
 
06:31:56.190 --> 06:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's not being made here
 
06:31:57.990 --> 06:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's being brought here people are
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
bringing in here so every person that's
 
06:32:02.590 --> 06:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
dying from a fentanyl over overdose in
 
06:32:06.510 --> 06:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
this state it's being brought into this
 
06:32:08.350 --> 06:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
state so if you're going to bring it
 
06:32:09.628 --> 06:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
into the state with the intent to
 
06:32:11.150 --> 06:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
distribute which can be established
 
06:32:13.830 --> 06:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
several ways it's not just the quantity
 
06:32:15.270 --> 06:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
amount it's how it's packaged if you
 
06:32:18.110 --> 06:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
have a scales on you if you have you
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
know a list of your customers which
 
06:32:22.468 --> 06:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a very smart thing to write
 
06:32:23.708 --> 06:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
down literally write down your criminal
 
06:32:26.110 --> 06:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise on paper but trust me it
 
06:32:29.948 --> 06:32:29.958 align:start position:0%
happens um if you have large quantities
 
06:32:32.270 --> 06:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
of of cash you know $5 $700 but you
 
06:32:34.150 --> 06:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any proof of employment these
 
06:32:36.468 --> 06:32:36.478 align:start position:0%
are ways they establish and tend to
 
06:32:38.468 --> 06:32:38.478 align:start position:0%
distribute if you have you can sometimes
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
have a smaller amount but if it's
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
packaged in let's say 30 different 30
 
06:32:44.910 --> 06:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
different bags that's one way to factor
 
06:32:48.230 --> 06:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
that in as well so this is to deter
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
people from bringing into the state
 
06:32:52.830 --> 06:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
because where I live Salem I am right
 
06:32:56.150 --> 06:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
next to the fentanyl Hub of New England
 
06:32:57.788 --> 06:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
and the fentanyl I mean they literally
 
06:33:02.350 --> 06:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
call the route from um from Lawrence up
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
when if you go through L into up come
 
06:33:07.910 --> 06:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
into Mar heroin Highway that's literally
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the name the nickname amongst uh the
 
06:33:13.708 --> 06:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
criminal Enterprises that's what they
 
06:33:16.190 --> 06:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
call it what often was happening and and
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
credit to the Rockham County Sheriff's
 
06:33:19.030 --> 06:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
Department doing a good job with this
 
06:33:21.070 --> 06:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
but for a while drugs are coming from
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
havil and they would say hey it's cut
 
06:33:23.388 --> 06:33:23.398 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire we won't be
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
detected if we want to get to Lawrence
 
06:33:28.628 --> 06:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
LOL well you know law enforcement to
 
06:33:30.628 --> 06:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
their credit is caught on to that but
 
06:33:32.388 --> 06:33:32.398 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening that's is what
 
06:33:33.548 --> 06:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here they're bringing
 
06:33:35.468 --> 06:33:35.478 align:start position:0%
in into the state people are dying from
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
it and if you're going to do that we're
 
06:33:39.708 --> 06:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
going to again adding it all on and I
 
06:33:41.548 --> 06:33:41.558 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of Sympathy for the drug
 
06:33:44.628 --> 06:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
addicts no and I think a part of the
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
problem is you got to hold people
 
06:33:49.230 --> 06:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
accountable for their behavior there is
 
06:33:51.628 --> 06:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
resources out there to deal with
 
06:33:54.708 --> 06:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
substance abuse there's several
 
06:33:58.388 --> 06:33:58.398 align:start position:0%
resources all right untreated if but if
 
06:33:59.948 --> 06:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
you're going to be Distributing drugs to
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
other people no sympathy for that that's
 
06:34:05.190 --> 06:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
why people are dying and if you import
 
06:34:07.110 --> 06:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
them into the state you're contributing
 
06:34:09.590 --> 06:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
to the problem and you're certainly not
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
doing anything to help help yourself so
 
06:34:15.230 --> 06:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're having a strict penalty guess what
 
06:34:17.510 --> 06:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
criminals do know when they cross over a
 
06:34:19.788 --> 06:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
border into a different jurisdiction
 
06:34:21.430 --> 06:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
that the penalties are different heck we
 
06:34:23.070 --> 06:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
all do that with our Firearms we know if
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
we go to other states what we're going
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
to deal
 
06:34:29.590 --> 06:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
with so I think we we can hold people
 
06:34:30.990 --> 06:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
accountable for what they're doing and
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
there needs to be accountability without
 
06:34:34.350 --> 06:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
accountability for this we're not going
 
06:34:36.910 --> 06:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
to get through this um this opioid
 
06:34:39.868 --> 06:34:39.878 align:start position:0%
crisis anytime soon so I'll take any
 
06:34:46.708 --> 06:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.468 --> 06:34:50.478 align:start position:0%
pass Representative no I wasn't I wasn't
 
06:34:51.868 --> 06:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
laughing at you please don't think that
 
06:34:55.190 --> 06:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
I was laugh with me um thank you madam
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for taking my
 
06:35:00.190 --> 06:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
question it's a little bit of a repeat
 
06:35:04.230 --> 06:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
it just uh it Rhymes um it's you
 
06:35:06.110 --> 06:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
I mean it it's in so many different
 
06:35:08.468 --> 06:35:08.478 align:start position:0%
things and what this says is any person
 
06:35:10.070 --> 06:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
who enters the state while possessing
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
any quantity of a fenal class drug I
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
mean that is I mean it could be so many
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
different things I just I wonder is is
 
06:35:22.150 --> 06:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
that what you meant like
 
06:35:24.990 --> 06:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
anything so listen possession with
 
06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
intent I I know the last testimony from
 
06:35:29.468 --> 06:35:29.478 align:start position:0%
the last bill someone said you have to
 
06:35:30.990 --> 06:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount to have POS uh
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
possession with intent uh yeah I don't
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
don't like to yell from the audience but
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
that was an incorrect statement of law
 
06:35:40.948 --> 06:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
the ACT there is no quantity um amount
 
06:35:42.388 --> 06:35:42.398 align:start position:0%
that would invoke the intent to
 
06:35:44.708 --> 06:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
distribute it's just one of many factors
 
06:35:46.430 --> 06:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
and that's the existing law already with
 
06:35:49.708 --> 06:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
possession with intent so this has to do
 
06:35:51.708 --> 06:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
with when you also import the fentanyl
 
06:35:54.230 --> 06:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
class drug into the state because we
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
know that they're not making fentanyl in
 
06:36:00.628 --> 06:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
the state so could you have less than
 
06:36:03.628 --> 06:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
four grams or less than three grams yes
 
06:36:06.070 --> 06:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
but it if you have let's say $2,000 in
 
06:36:09.948 --> 06:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
cash on you you have a scales on you
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
these are these are if it's package in a
 
06:36:14.708 --> 06:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
bunch of different small bags so if
 
06:36:16.948 --> 06:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
you're you're you know your 3,000 lethal
 
06:36:19.070 --> 06:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
doses of fentanyl that some people
 
06:36:20.910 --> 06:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
believe apparently just for an addict's
 
06:36:23.310 --> 06:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
individual use well if it's individually
 
06:36:26.430 --> 06:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
bagged into single doses that's usually
 
06:36:27.948 --> 06:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
another sign of
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
distribution uh that's wellknown I mean
 
06:36:31.868 --> 06:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses have testified to that
 
06:36:35.350 --> 06:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
in court uh as proving possession with
 
06:36:39.030 --> 06:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
intent so the actual quantity of the
 
06:36:41.388 --> 06:36:41.398 align:start position:0%
drug is just one factor obviously having
 
06:36:43.670 --> 06:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
a lower dose makes it much harder to
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
prove but when it says any dose that's
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
the existing Law And that's pretty
 
06:36:49.030 --> 06:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout other other states
 
06:36:49.040 --> 06:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout other other states
as

06:36:49.750 --> 06:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:36:53.430 --> 06:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
well quick followup so what what I'm
 
06:36:55.070 --> 06:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about is okay so if you if you
 
06:36:57.070 --> 06:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
were coming in all of those other
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
factors were intact right you had things
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
bagged a portioned you know however you
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
had had uh a large quantity of cash or
 
06:37:07.868 --> 06:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
um whatever things I could think of
 
06:37:08.990 --> 06:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
other reasons for it's a large
 
06:37:10.190 --> 06:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
quantities of cash without proof of
 
06:37:12.468 --> 06:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
employment it's Lu that they give away
 
06:37:16.110 --> 06:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you and but but I guess
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
what my question is is is it could be in
 
06:37:20.468 --> 06:37:20.478 align:start position:0%
something that you think is something
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
else but then when the te Police test it
 
06:37:24.830 --> 06:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
it would you could see that there was
 
06:37:27.388 --> 06:37:27.398 align:start position:0%
feny in it so that any quantity of feny
 
06:37:29.190 --> 06:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
in something that you may have had no
 
06:37:31.430 --> 06:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
idea had fenel in it in the first place
 
06:37:34.830 --> 06:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
so there may not be a m minimum of 5
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
years for you bringing something else in
 
06:37:39.708 --> 06:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
but come to find out it's got feny in it
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
which most things do and then it's a
 
06:37:43.628 --> 06:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum and you had no idea
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
that was in there so claiming ignorance
 
06:37:49.070 --> 06:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
because what you thought was heroin
 
06:37:50.430 --> 06:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
turned out to be fentanyl or your
 
06:37:52.868 --> 06:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
cocaine was laced with
 
06:37:54.788 --> 06:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
fentanyl I guess if that's going to be
 
06:37:57.628 --> 06:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
the defense it's still possession with
 
06:37:59.628 --> 06:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
intent so they're still going to face a
 
06:38:00.750 --> 06:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
pretty tough
 
06:38:05.350 --> 06:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
charge uh I I guess my point is we're
 
06:38:06.948 --> 06:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
trying to I've been hearing a lot of
 
06:38:08.910 --> 06:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
excuses for people who
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
are in possession of a large amount of
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
drugs and now importing them and doing
 
06:38:15.270 --> 06:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
all the stuff and I not hearing anything
 
06:38:17.150 --> 06:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
about how to hold people accountable
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
I've been listening to it all the whole
 
06:38:21.670 --> 06:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
time and I'm just pointing it out I
 
06:38:23.270 --> 06:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
understand is the treatment side I
 
06:38:25.868 --> 06:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
understand that people if someone buys
 
06:38:30.150 --> 06:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know $100 worth of a drug and they
 
06:38:32.150 --> 06:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
go from Lawrence into New Hampshire I
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand that maybe you think may
 
06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
think it's a harsh penalty but again
 
06:38:39.670 --> 06:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're bringing this lethal drug into
 
06:38:41.910 --> 06:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
the state it's unlikely that that's
 
06:38:43.430 --> 06:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to be possessed with intent unless
 
06:38:45.388 --> 06:38:45.398 align:start position:0%
they have the money the scale there has
 
06:38:47.468 --> 06:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
to be much more to it because the high
 
06:38:49.750 --> 06:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
burden of proof very difficult to prove
 
06:38:51.670 --> 06:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
if they just have a few bags of
 
06:38:53.788 --> 06:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
something uh if it's when they have
 
06:38:55.788 --> 06:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
drugs for Beyond individual use Le you
 
06:38:57.948 --> 06:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
can imply that on the amount that they
 
06:39:00.388 --> 06:39:00.398 align:start position:0%
have so I've seen it happen several
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
times and I've had people charged with
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
these offenses it's
 
06:39:06.190 --> 06:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove the possession with
 
06:39:07.548 --> 06:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
intent even when they do have the
 
06:39:10.750 --> 06:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
individual bags and the money thank
 
06:39:13.708 --> 06:39:13.718 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:39:16.590 --> 06:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
Muse so as as I read our current statute
 
06:39:19.990 --> 06:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like um you can be prosecuted
 
06:39:22.510 --> 06:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh simply for
 
06:39:25.628 --> 06:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
transporting um fentanyl uh within the
 
06:39:27.230 --> 06:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
state regardless of whether or not
 
06:39:30.310 --> 06:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're transporting it uh across state
 
06:39:33.430 --> 06:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
lines so and and I also understand just
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
reading our current statute um that you
 
06:39:38.030 --> 06:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
can be sentenced uh for up to 30 years
 
06:39:41.868 --> 06:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
for doing that so what I'm not
 
06:39:44.670 --> 06:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
is how we're making people any more
 
06:39:51.510 --> 06:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
accountable uh by passing this bill than
 
06:39:55.590 --> 06:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
law I can answer that for you different
 
06:40:01.590 --> 06:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
context I had a Someone who lived in
 
06:40:03.310 --> 06:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
Worcester County came all the way to
 
06:40:06.910 --> 06:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
essic County to just rob a few cars and
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
trying to understand my knowledge of the
 
06:40:11.468 --> 06:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
criminal underworld as I do my job why
 
06:40:13.270 --> 06:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
would you drive that far away I mean you
 
06:40:14.910 --> 06:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
you you came all the well they didn't
 
06:40:16.750 --> 06:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
want to get ID that was their answer I
 
06:40:17.868 --> 06:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
said well you getting awfully close to
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how come you didn't come
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
up here and their answer was well the
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
penalties up there one breaking into
 
06:40:26.388 --> 06:40:26.398 align:start position:0%
people's property not as ill advised in
 
06:40:28.270 --> 06:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based on some of the stany
 
06:40:30.388 --> 06:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
ground laws also the type of penalty
 
06:40:33.310 --> 06:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
they would face was much harsher that
 
06:40:34.388 --> 06:40:34.398 align:start position:0%
that's coming from someone who's
 
06:40:37.628 --> 06:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
breaking the law in another state so if
 
06:40:39.150 --> 06:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
someone's going to be transporting
 
06:40:42.750 --> 06:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and engaging all his activity
 
06:40:44.350 --> 06:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
we can't control what happens in other
 
06:40:47.030 --> 06:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
states we can control what happens here
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
they know and when dealers are
 
06:40:52.708 --> 06:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
transporting throughout New England uh
 
06:40:55.590 --> 06:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
there there was a time when it the
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
advice that would go out there was to
 
06:40:58.628 --> 06:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
not stop when you're traveling through
 
06:41:01.468 --> 06:41:01.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that was before a bail
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
reform because they don't they want just
 
06:41:05.590 --> 06:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
keep on
 
06:41:08.270 --> 06:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
going that was what that's those were
 
06:41:10.750 --> 06:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
normally the orders of the people who
 
06:41:12.150 --> 06:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
are trafficking drugs throughout the
 
06:41:14.388 --> 06:41:14.398 align:start position:0%
area so people are if you're going to
 
06:41:16.628 --> 06:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
import drugs into this state that's what
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deter that message will
 
06:41:20.948 --> 06:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
be known in the criminal trust me they
 
06:41:20.958 --> 06:41:21.788 align:start position:0%
be known in the criminal trust me they
will

06:41:21.788 --> 06:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:41:24.990 --> 06:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
know they and I'm I'm telling you that
 
06:41:27.548 --> 06:41:27.558 align:start position:0%
that will be act as a
 
06:41:29.788 --> 06:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
deterrent Massachusetts right now if you
 
06:41:32.510 --> 06:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a large capacity firearm that's
 
06:41:34.270 --> 06:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
that has a magazine azine full it's
 
06:41:36.030 --> 06:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
without a license it's 18 months
 
06:41:38.150 --> 06:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence all the people don't
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
like mandatory sentences reach out to
 
06:41:41.948 --> 06:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
that state but the fire I'm and it's in
 
06:41:45.150 --> 06:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
18 months on top of that for just the
 
06:41:47.510 --> 06:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
magazine I live right on the border I
 
06:41:51.070 --> 06:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
know very well not to bring that firearm
 
06:41:53.030 --> 06:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
into that state I travel quite
 
06:41:54.510 --> 06:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
frequently they have my offices located
 
06:41:56.590 --> 06:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
there because that's the law and I
 
06:41:59.628 --> 06:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
respect the law when I'm in When in Rome
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
so we're asking people to do the same
 
06:42:02.160 --> 06:42:04.510 align:start position:0%
so we're asking people to do the same
here

06:42:04.510 --> 06:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:42:08.430 --> 06:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
senator for I if I may ask a question um
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
so if you could put on
 
06:42:15.510 --> 06:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
your your employer hat for a second um I
 
06:42:17.868 --> 06:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
don't remember the the person testified
 
06:42:20.030 --> 06:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
to it but there was a comment that was
 
06:42:23.548 --> 06:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
made about when the police come
 
06:42:25.468 --> 06:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
everybody's running right they're taking
 
06:42:28.270 --> 06:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
off which which by the way is also can
 
06:42:30.670 --> 06:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
be a crime of resisting arrest so I
 
06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
would whoever recommended that um very
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
advised well
 
06:42:39.110 --> 06:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
just I've never ran from the cops but
 
06:42:42.510 --> 06:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the point um so so my my
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
question is this if if so that comment
 
06:42:46.590 --> 06:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
was made about you know generally
 
06:42:47.948 --> 06:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
speaking you see the cops and you're
 
06:42:49.548 --> 06:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
you're booking it and I'm the one on a
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
touch right why would the person be
 
06:42:55.110 --> 06:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
cops not recommended they either quite
 
06:43:01.030 --> 06:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
often they have a warrant out sometimes
 
06:43:03.110 --> 06:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe it or not the the cops and
 
06:43:04.110 --> 06:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
people who are involved in the drug
 
06:43:05.670 --> 06:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
trade it's not always their first
 
06:43:08.430 --> 06:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
interaction together they they tend to
 
06:43:10.590 --> 06:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
recognize each other especially in some
 
06:43:11.948 --> 06:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
communities which I mean you'll see that
 
06:43:13.468 --> 06:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
in the police reports why they're
 
06:43:15.670 --> 06:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
following the person in the first place
 
06:43:17.150 --> 06:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
they someone so was a known trafficking
 
06:43:19.510 --> 06:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
they would cite in the report but the
 
06:43:21.388 --> 06:43:21.398 align:start position:0%
previous arrest they had involving drug
 
06:43:22.590 --> 06:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
traffick with this
 
06:43:24.510 --> 06:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
individual you know when when they're on
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
patrol they're you know when the drug
 
06:43:28.868 --> 06:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
task force doing their thing they see it
 
06:43:30.628 --> 06:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
and then when they go to stop the person
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
the person
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
runs so quite often they run and then
 
06:43:37.388 --> 06:43:37.398 align:start position:0%
try to throw whatever they have on them
 
06:43:39.628 --> 06:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
and by the way that does destroy any
 
06:43:41.670 --> 06:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
search and seizure
 
06:43:43.510 --> 06:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
argument thank
 
06:43:46.190 --> 06:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
you and I just clarify it was not a
 
06:43:48.110 --> 06:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation it was just an offering
 
06:43:51.150 --> 06:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
that of what they observe happening that
 
06:43:54.948 --> 06:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:57.310 --> 06:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
police well it's recorded on video so we
 
06:43:59.190 --> 06:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
can play it
 
06:44:02.030 --> 06:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
back I'll be happy to thank you
 
06:44:02.040 --> 06:44:05.310 align:start position:0%
back I'll be happy to thank you

06:44:07.590 --> 06:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you please support autop pass
 
06:44:07.600 --> 06:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you please support autop pass
thank

06:44:11.030 --> 06:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:32.030 --> 06:44:32.040 align:start position:0%

curiel

06:44:39.868 --> 06:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Dominic Cel I'm a second year
 
06:44:43.708 --> 06:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
law student at UNH Franklin Pierce
 
06:44:46.590 --> 06:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
School of Law I have a criminal justice
 
06:44:49.468 --> 06:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
degree in um from San Diego State
 
06:44:52.388 --> 06:44:52.398 align:start position:0%
University and today I'm requesting that
 
06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
the committee amend SB 316 simply by
 
06:45:00.310 --> 06:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
adding the word knowingly in front of
 
06:45:02.510 --> 06:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
transports I think you'll find that my
 
06:45:05.628 --> 06:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
experience living in Southern
 
06:45:05.638 --> 06:45:08.190 align:start position:0%
experience living in Southern
California

06:45:08.190 --> 06:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
California
 
06:45:10.590 --> 06:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
and my legal background my legal
 
06:45:12.990 --> 06:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
training has prepared me to spot out
 
06:45:16.750 --> 06:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
this slight um I guess you could say
 
06:45:18.388 --> 06:45:18.398 align:start position:0%
inadequacy of the bill with all due
 
06:45:21.030 --> 06:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
respect for the makers of the bill but
 
06:45:23.310 --> 06:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
the word knowingly appears nowhere in
 
06:45:23.320 --> 06:45:24.868 align:start position:0%
the word knowingly appears nowhere in
the

06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
um in the bill
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
and from my
 
06:45:34.430 --> 06:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
experience um I had a cooworker who was
 
06:45:37.030 --> 06:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
he was offered around $5,000 to
 
06:45:39.750 --> 06:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
transport to drive a car basically just
 
06:45:42.990 --> 06:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
from Mex just across the Mexican border
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
that's all he was told is you're going
 
06:45:47.548 --> 06:45:47.558 align:start position:0%
to drive this car and in fact that's
 
06:45:49.190 --> 06:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
what these cartels have been doing for
 
06:45:51.110 --> 06:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
years they've been outfitting
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
cars um with hidden compartments and
 
06:45:56.670 --> 06:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
I've actually included um just an
 
06:46:00.030 --> 06:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
article in in my written testimony they
 
06:46:01.548 --> 06:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
outfit these cars with these
 
06:46:03.788 --> 06:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
compartments and they hire people on the
 
06:46:07.270 --> 06:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
American side of the Border because um
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
it would be suspicious to hire a Mexican
 
06:46:12.830 --> 06:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:14.990 --> 06:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
America and the money is too good to
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
turn turn down it's it's an incredible
 
06:46:20.110 --> 06:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money for somebody who may be
 
06:46:22.868 --> 06:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
struggling and it's an easy
 
06:46:26.670 --> 06:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
job so I'm not here to argue over a
 
06:46:29.310 --> 06:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums today I think this is
 
06:46:33.788 --> 06:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
a a title wave that um has momentum
 
06:46:37.070 --> 06:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
I want to use my training from UNH uh
 
06:46:39.310 --> 06:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
law school to protect criminal
 
06:46:42.628 --> 06:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
defendants and um this would protect
 
06:46:45.910 --> 06:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants um there's a legal
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
concept called men's Rea which which is
 
06:46:51.910 --> 06:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
translates to mental state each criminal
 
06:46:54.788 --> 06:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
um statute has a mental state if there's
 
06:46:58.510 --> 06:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
none the the the court May read in a
 
06:46:58.520 --> 06:46:59.548 align:start position:0%
none the the the court May read in a
mental

06:46:59.548 --> 06:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
mental
 
06:47:02.548 --> 06:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
state um however I want to save the the
 
06:47:05.070 --> 06:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
state time and money I don't want to see
 
06:47:06.830 --> 06:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state U I don't want to see another
 
06:47:08.468 --> 06:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
one of these cases in my textbooks I see
 
06:47:10.750 --> 06:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
it all the time and this this reminded
 
06:47:13.150 --> 06:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
me of a case I read um in criminal
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
law So to avoid unnecessary litigation
 
06:47:18.750 --> 06:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
let's just add in the word knowingly
 
06:47:23.310 --> 06:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a big change um
 
06:47:26.230 --> 06:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
but um it
 
06:47:28.990 --> 06:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
is it's a level of
 
06:47:31.830 --> 06:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
culpability um New Hampshire recognizes
 
06:47:36.708 --> 06:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
as um linked in my written
 
06:47:41.270 --> 06:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um New Hampshire NH rev stat
 
06:47:41.280 --> 06:47:42.830 align:start position:0%
testimony um New Hampshire NH rev stat
and

06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:47:47.510 --> 06:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
626 uh colon 2 in my conclusion um
 
06:47:49.468 --> 06:47:49.478 align:start position:0%
describes level of culpability in New
 
06:47:53.590 --> 06:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it actually alludes to um
 
06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
attaching a mental state a men's Rea to
 
06:47:59.990 --> 06:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
each material element of the offense and
 
06:48:03.150 --> 06:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
as you know um transporting is a
 
06:48:05.190 --> 06:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
material element of this
 
06:48:05.200 --> 06:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
material element of this
offense

06:48:07.030 --> 06:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
offense
 
06:48:10.070 --> 06:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so we are in the middle of an opioid
 
06:48:13.190 --> 06:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
epidemic and I can tell you firsthand
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
that um the reason we've we've gotten to
 
06:48:20.628 --> 06:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
this place is is fentol and the reason
 
06:48:23.788 --> 06:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
that cartels are are producing it at an
 
06:48:28.150 --> 06:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary rate is it's easy to um
 
06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
produce you can produce it in a house
 
06:48:33.388 --> 06:48:33.398 align:start position:0%
whereas um cocaine requires
 
06:48:36.910 --> 06:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
just a enormously large field of cocoa
 
06:48:39.030 --> 06:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
leaves and sometimes the Mexican
 
06:48:41.708 --> 06:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
Government will will um burn down these
 
06:48:41.718 --> 06:48:43.230 align:start position:0%
Government will will um burn down these
crops

06:48:43.230 --> 06:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
crops
 
06:48:47.628 --> 06:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
and so these cartels are getting um
 
06:48:47.638 --> 06:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
and so these cartels are getting um
experience

06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:48:52.230 --> 06:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
from Chinese chemists coming across the
 
06:48:54.190 --> 06:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
border teaching them how to make these
 
06:48:57.030 --> 06:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
drugs and they're making it in houses
 
06:48:58.230 --> 06:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're called
 
06:48:58.240 --> 06:49:00.990 align:start position:0%
they're called
phenias

06:49:00.990 --> 06:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
phenias
 
06:49:03.350 --> 06:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
and I just would like to to see any
 
06:49:06.230 --> 06:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
criminal defendant um hired without the
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
transporting what they're transporting I
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
know it seems ridiculous that you
 
06:49:13.788 --> 06:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what you're transporting
 
06:49:13.798 --> 06:49:15.310 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what you're transporting
but

06:49:15.310 --> 06:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:49:18.190 --> 06:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
um this is is sort of adding an
 
06:49:20.430 --> 06:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
additional layer to the intent to
 
06:49:23.110 --> 06:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
distribute so if the state was to find
 
06:49:26.310 --> 06:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
scales and baggies as the former speaker
 
06:49:29.230 --> 06:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
referred to that could show intent and
 
06:49:34.030 --> 06:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
actually criminal history could be um
 
06:49:36.548 --> 06:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
is is can be used against a criminal
 
06:49:39.310 --> 06:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
defendant to show um propensity to
 
06:49:44.350 --> 06:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:48.270 --> 06:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
protect um the People
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
by by adding this mental men's Rea in
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
front of the word
 
06:49:56.270 --> 06:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
transporting um thank you very much and
 
06:49:59.388 --> 06:49:59.398 align:start position:0%
I'm open asking answering any questions
 
06:50:01.350 --> 06:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you madam
 
06:50:05.030 --> 06:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
chair first my first thought about this
 
06:50:07.788 --> 06:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
men's Rea is um if somebody approached
 
06:50:09.350 --> 06:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
me and said would you drive this car
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
across the
 
06:50:14.110 --> 06:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
border um for $5,000 I think that would
 
06:50:17.590 --> 06:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
trigger a red flag of course you know
 
06:50:19.388 --> 06:50:19.398 align:start position:0%
it's just ridiculous to not know
 
06:50:22.030 --> 06:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
something's off with that and how would
 
06:50:27.468 --> 06:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
you Pro prove now um a men's Rea or no
 
06:50:28.990 --> 06:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
somebody had knowledge of what they were
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
doing if their goto default would be I
 
06:50:33.230 --> 06:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
06:50:36.110 --> 06:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't know I think that's kind
 
06:50:38.990 --> 06:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
of a stretch but if you could uh you
 
06:50:40.990 --> 06:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
know elaborate a little of course thank
 
06:50:44.670 --> 06:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question
 
06:50:47.350 --> 06:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
um what a court now I'm a I'm a
 
06:50:49.628 --> 06:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
second-year law student um I'm set up to
 
06:50:51.708 --> 06:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
work with the district attorney this
 
06:50:54.510 --> 06:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
this um summer so I don't really know
 
06:50:56.430 --> 06:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs but I I did look up
 
06:51:00.310 --> 06:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
knowingly in the New Hampshire um
 
06:51:04.150 --> 06:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
statute and the criminal code and and um
 
06:51:06.350 --> 06:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a subjective standard so
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
the the prosecution would just inquire
 
06:51:10.590 --> 06:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just said what did you
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
at what what what did you know it's a
 
06:51:15.708 --> 06:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
very subjective test so people wouldn't
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
just be able to say oh I didn't know
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
because the pro a good prosecutor will
 
06:51:20.990 --> 06:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
ask question will say what questions did
 
06:51:23.510 --> 06:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
you ask how did you not know this is
 
06:51:27.468 --> 06:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
exactly um and to to be
 
06:51:31.270 --> 06:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
clear I am um
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
totally I'm for putting people in jail
 
06:51:37.628 --> 06:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
if they knowingly um distribute or
 
06:51:40.430 --> 06:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
transport and I'm
 
06:51:43.270 --> 06:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
even more
 
06:51:45.430 --> 06:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
for having these
 
06:51:48.110 --> 06:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
people um be accountable for asking
 
06:51:49.788 --> 06:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
questions and not playing dumb and I
 
06:51:51.868 --> 06:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
don't think playing dumb would by adding
 
06:51:53.388 --> 06:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
this word in front of transports it
 
06:51:55.150 --> 06:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
would not allow a criminal defendant to
 
06:51:58.070 --> 06:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
play dumb in my in my view I think it's
 
06:52:01.708 --> 06:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
a great bill I really do and and it's it
 
06:52:01.718 --> 06:52:04.910 align:start position:0%
a great bill I really do and and it's it
um

06:52:04.910 --> 06:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:07.510 --> 06:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I really do I really appreciate
 
06:52:10.590 --> 06:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
this build and at first I had um well
 
06:52:17.468 --> 06:52:17.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:19.590 --> 06:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
to see no more questions thank you very
 
06:52:24.590 --> 06:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:24.600 --> 06:52:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:52:30.070 --> 06:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:42.510 --> 06:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon commune members uh my
 
06:52:47.628 --> 06:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
name is Claire bich I am also a seconde
 
06:52:49.948 --> 06:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
law student um at UNH law here in
 
06:52:51.830 --> 06:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
conquer I'm very passionate about
 
06:52:53.670 --> 06:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
criminal law I plan to go into criminal
 
06:52:56.830 --> 06:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution after graduation um so I do
 
06:52:59.548 --> 06:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
appear here today to support sb316 just
 
06:53:00.750 --> 06:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
with a couple
 
06:53:03.070 --> 06:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
modifications um while I Court haral
 
06:53:04.990 --> 06:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
penalties for the possession of fental a
 
06:53:07.430 --> 06:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
minimum of 5 years is a harsh price to
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
pay without first setting a minimum
 
06:53:12.388 --> 06:53:12.398 align:start position:0%
quantity required uh before that
 
06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
sentence goes into effect so under the
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
current draft even Trace Amounts of
 
06:53:19.310 --> 06:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
fentol will land some in prison for five
 
06:53:21.628 --> 06:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
whole years and mandatory minimums
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
aren't new in New Hampshire um so I've
 
06:53:30.030 --> 06:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
provided two examples one is RSA 6512 2B
 
06:53:32.150 --> 06:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
U where there's a minimum sentence of 3
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
years for a subsequent or second offense
 
06:53:38.110 --> 06:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
of a felonious use of a firearm um so
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
the second time that a felon uses a
 
06:53:43.070 --> 06:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
firearm is when a minimum sentence is
 
06:53:47.230 --> 06:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
used and then also RSA 318
 
06:53:49.468 --> 06:53:49.478 align:start position:0%
b265 this will look a little familiar
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
considering this is the RSA that's being
 
06:53:54.788 --> 06:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
amended in this bill um so only after a
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
person manufactures cells dispenses Etc
 
06:54:00.350 --> 06:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
in or around a school is a mandatory
 
06:54:02.788 --> 06:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
minimum imposed and in this case that
 
06:54:05.350 --> 06:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
minimum is only a year and that's for
 
06:54:07.948 --> 06:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
exposing School AG children to any kind
 
06:54:07.958 --> 06:54:09.070 align:start position:0%
exposing School AG children to any kind
of

06:54:09.070 --> 06:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:54:12.150 --> 06:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
drug so in comparison to these examples
 
06:54:15.150 --> 06:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
5 years is a steep priced pay for even a
 
06:54:17.310 --> 06:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
firsttime offense for any amount in
 
06:54:19.350 --> 06:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
fentol while entering the state of New
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mandatory minimums also
 
06:54:23.788 --> 06:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate judicial discretion to impose
 
06:54:25.788 --> 06:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
a prison term lower than the statutory
 
06:54:28.708 --> 06:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
floor making specific information about
 
06:54:31.830 --> 06:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
the offense or the offender irrelevant
 
06:54:33.628 --> 06:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
at least to the extent that facts might
 
06:54:36.190 --> 06:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
call for a below minimum
 
06:54:39.070 --> 06:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
sentence historically manum mandatory
 
06:54:40.948 --> 06:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
minimums have only burdened our criminal
 
06:54:42.910 --> 06:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
justice system by making people serve
 
06:54:45.150 --> 06:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
sentences that may not provide the
 
06:54:48.388 --> 06:54:48.398 align:start position:0%
correct deterrent effect for them um so
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
I cited to a study sponsored by the US
 
06:54:52.750 --> 06:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice that shows that
 
06:54:55.110 --> 06:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentences do little or
 
06:54:57.628 --> 06:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
nothing to actually DET deter people
 
06:55:00.070 --> 06:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
from committing crimes and that's an
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
expensive risk to make when in 2020 one
 
06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
I believe the New Hampshire Department
 
06:55:07.388 --> 06:55:07.398 align:start position:0%
of Corrections um estimated that the
 
06:55:13.150 --> 06:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:16.270 --> 06:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
$4,380 so in conclusion I respectfully
 
06:55:19.708 --> 06:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee modify SB 316 to
 
06:55:22.110 --> 06:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
either lower the minimum sentence
 
06:55:23.948 --> 06:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
require a certain amount of fenta before
 
06:55:25.830 --> 06:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum minimum sentence is actually
 
06:55:28.190 --> 06:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
imposed or provide exceptions or
 
06:55:30.190 --> 06:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
situations where judges can impose a
 
06:55:35.110 --> 06:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:38.150 --> 06:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss be are there any
 
06:55:46.708 --> 06:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
Lin thank you so much um again Ted St
 
06:56:04.070 --> 06:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
06:56:05.830 --> 06:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal offense lawyers
 
06:56:08.670 --> 06:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
I think that everyone is here who was
 
06:56:11.868 --> 06:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
here when I testified earlier um with
 
06:56:13.708 --> 06:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
respect to SB
 
06:56:16.350 --> 06:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
414 in opposition to it I'm not going to
 
06:56:18.830 --> 06:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
repeat any of that that's why I didn't
 
06:56:21.310 --> 06:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
ask to um speak with respect to the
 
06:56:22.830 --> 06:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
related Bill
 
06:56:25.468 --> 06:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
sp415 the only reason I came up here is
 
06:56:28.430 --> 06:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
to express something that may be obvious
 
06:56:30.150 --> 06:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
to everyone in the committee and if so I
 
06:56:31.670 --> 06:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
apologize but I'm only going to take up
 
06:56:33.388 --> 06:56:33.398 align:start position:0%
a minute or two of your times just late
 
06:56:36.948 --> 06:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
in the day and it just feels so obvious
 
06:56:39.350 --> 06:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
the other bills I'm just going to call
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
um well intention but misguided but this
 
06:56:46.590 --> 06:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
this bill just seems completely
 
06:56:49.628 --> 06:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
broken the people who go to
 
06:56:52.388 --> 06:56:52.398 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to get drugs to bring them
 
06:56:55.788 --> 06:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire are us it's not
 
06:56:58.110 --> 06:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
methampetamine we can't make it
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
ourselves in our kitchen just as the
 
06:57:03.030 --> 06:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
senator said it all comes from somewhere
 
06:57:08.830 --> 06:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
else so for every drug dealer in south
 
06:57:12.150 --> 06:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
of Salem and methan or or havo or
 
06:57:14.510 --> 06:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
Lawrence who drives across the border to
 
06:57:16.948 --> 06:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
sell there's probably five to 10 New
 
06:57:19.070 --> 06:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who drive down to
 
06:57:21.750 --> 06:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
those cities to buy and when they come
 
06:57:24.070 --> 06:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
back now they're facing a mandatory
 
06:57:27.830 --> 06:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
minimum only because a mandatory minimum
 
06:57:30.388 --> 06:57:30.398 align:start position:0%
five years with no exceptions even for a
 
06:57:33.230 --> 06:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
first offender simply because they chose
 
06:57:35.830 --> 06:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
to buy their drugs in Lawrence instead
 
06:57:42.230 --> 06:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
of Salem OR in in um in um you
 
06:57:46.510 --> 06:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
know in Newburyport instead of Hampton
 
06:57:49.030 --> 06:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
Beach it's crazy this doesn't make any
 
06:57:50.628 --> 06:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
sense at all and I'm I'm probably being
 
06:57:52.110 --> 06:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
a little intemperate in how I describe
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
it but that's what this bill would do
 
06:57:57.310 --> 06:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
what it would the result would be if it
 
06:57:59.190 --> 06:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
has any deterrent effect at all
 
06:58:01.030 --> 06:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts drug dealers would just
 
06:58:03.310 --> 06:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
set up more operations in New Hampshire
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
so they're so they have the stuff here
 
06:58:06.948 --> 06:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
and they're selling it here so they're
 
06:58:08.948 --> 06:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be caught transporting it
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
across the border this does not make any
 
06:58:13.510 --> 06:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
sense all the drugs are coming from
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere our own citizens who are sick
 
06:58:17.990 --> 06:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
with addiction are going across the
 
06:58:19.830 --> 06:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
boorder to get it we should not put them
 
06:58:22.230 --> 06:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
in prison for five years for driving
 
06:58:25.190 --> 06:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
that extra mile from Salem into methan
 
06:58:27.510 --> 06:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
or wherever they end up and that's all I
 
06:58:29.670 --> 06:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:58:31.750 --> 06:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
say thank you very much are there any
 
06:58:31.760 --> 06:58:33.310 align:start position:0%
