00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's a little bit after 1 101 102 I'm
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and open uh today's um
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh session uh we have eight bills to
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
review um and uh four of these bills
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
have new fiscal notes that are brand
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
spanking new um so there's there's that
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
and then we were providing provided with
 
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
some additional information um by U
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
folks like the child advocate and all so
 
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh of these eight bills um about five of
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
them seem fairly complex that we need to
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
understand what is happening what the
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
processes are that's going to change and
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
the new work that's being required
 
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
because it's that incremental workload
 
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to um uh Drive the cost
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
and and so we need to understand you
 
00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 align:start position:0%
know the basic concept of of many of
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
um before we really get into this I want
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
to welcome um our you're sitting in
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
today for
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
Laura representative tersi is uh doing
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
something important with her daughter um
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
so we have a a guest star here today and
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
want to permanently introduce um Mr
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
David priest he's U now a fully
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
functional member of uh division 3 in
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
the finance committee uh he comes with a
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
comes to us with uh this this one year
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
under his belt as a representative and
 
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
he hasn't had any ethical challenges so
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
so that that that makes you rare and
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
good uh and um he comes with a
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous background the only thing
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
flaw I can find is that he's a
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
university of Wisconsin fan so and I'm a
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
Nebraska fan but uh other than that I
 
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
think we're probably going to get along
 
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
do do you want to introduce yourself you
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
you have a very impressive resume all
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
kidding aside it's a very impressive
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
resume thank you very much um it's an
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
honor to be with you today and for the
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the year that's all I'm going to
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
say I have my work cut out okay so we're
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to put him down in the modest
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
category too he does have an impressive
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
resume but I don't want to steal his
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
Thunder um all right so with that like I
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
said we have eight bills uh I would like
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
to start with um Mr David weers from the
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
Department's it department and and the
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
reason I'm I'm starting with him is
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
because there's um there's five of the
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
eight bills require
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
it updates and modification and so I
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
just want to knowing what I thought I
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
knew about the workload of your
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
department and your implementation of of
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
modifications and upgrades in support of
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
the commissioner strategic plan I just
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure um that that we had
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
a conversation about any concerns you
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
may have about um potentially having
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
five new it syst system upgrades uh
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
dumped on you particularly when some of
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
these bills say they go into effect 60
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
days after signing or go into effect
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
immediately so not much time to
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
change thank you my name is David
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
weeders the information Services
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
director for DHHS thank you for the
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards and
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um with the exception of hb1
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
1573 we sure I administrative problem um
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
my uh secretary is uh is not here he's
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
introducing another bill could could
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
could one of you take notes um and and
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
until uh representative Stringham
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
representative
H

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
H
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
right might I ask a question while we're
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for him to get that up yes sir I
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
I noticed that we did not include HB
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
1363 on the agenda and I'm just
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
wondering that's another one that that
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know they came through with an FN
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
note through this past you know the past
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
few weeks is that something we're going
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
to wait and hold off till
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
the I I have a visibility issue uh go
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr Ripple I think uh first of all
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
I think that passed more recently than
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
these some of these might have been from
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago it didn't okay well I
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
think there was some confusion also
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
whether it would whether it belonged in
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
division one or division 3 it's my
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
understanding that it'll probably come
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
to division 3 uh but obviously it hasn't
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
yet been scheduled so we'll try to get
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
that scheduled for the near future so so
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
that sounds like the one that um I just
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
got this afternoon and it was a tossup
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 3 and I took it because
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to schedule another followup
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
to this session on Monday afternoon and
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
we'll add it Monday afternoon because it
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
didn't show up on today's calendar I
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
don't think we can hear it okay all
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
right are you ready okay so this Mr
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
right are you ready okay so this Mr
David

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
weers thank you for the record David
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
weeders Information Services director
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS um as as it relates to these bills
 
00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the exception of HP
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
1573 which we're still working on an
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal note for worksheet for we
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
believe that we have the resources
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
necessary and most of the bills
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
introduce nominal systems changes so
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
they won't be full upgrades but they
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
will require us to identify the
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
reporting impacts as well as the system
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
impacts to achieve the different goals
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
of each of those bills the associated um
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts for the work on each of
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
the bills are for the research needed
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
the regression or the testing needed for
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
the systems to ensure that the reports
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
and the systems um operate properly and
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
go into production
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
in regards to the 60 days subsequent to
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
the bill passing on each one of those we
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
would need to address how it may impact
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
our Contracting process um which would
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
not it takes longer than 60 days for us
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
to update a contract with funding I
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
would defer to Nathan if he has
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
additional information um to answer your
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards so so so
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
I have two one is I think the least cost
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
up upgrade is is
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
$290,000 and and that
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
$290,000 is listed for both 1564 and
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
1595 it those could be it could be a
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
coincidence that the two bills have
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
similar child support words in it and it
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
may be a coincidence that the it upgrade
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
is the same cost I just I just want to
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
know if that's really you know one
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade or or two upgrades es of both
 
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
upgrade or or two upgrades es of both
bills

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
passed do and that you may not have an
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
answer for that right now yeah I I don't
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
have the answer for that exact question
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
can take that back to the team and and
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
validate that it is either two separate
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
or Nathan might have additional
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
information hello Mr White would you
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
read your name into the record good
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee uh
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
Nathan white Chief Financial Officer
 
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
Services um to answer your question
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um when we
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
receive a fiscal note request from the
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
LBA we look at the we look at the
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and our
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that and then we
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
conduct our analysis on those costs so
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
it may just be a coincidence that those
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are the same but but those
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
estimates are based on what we see in
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and what we expect to be the
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost so those were done in
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
isolation and not
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
concurrently I I suspect it as much um
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
so um on the possib we're not going to
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
be voting on anything today obviously
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back Monday
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh to to relook at all of
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
these plus plus one more bill um and on
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon if if I could just have
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
a a a simple analysis on if those two
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
bills uh 1564 and 1595 if if they both
 
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.269 align:start position:0%
bills uh 1564 and 1595 if if they both
got

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
passed uh what would what would be the
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
it modification or upgrade cost in that
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
in that situ instead of 290 * 2 is it
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
290 * 1.2 or something sure to see if
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of cost savings we
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
could achieve upon passage of both
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
correct right yeah right because because
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
they sound like they're doing something
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
similar to changing that information
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
system and so it just feels like it
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
could be one one upgrade instead of two
 
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
but um now uh Mr weers uh
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
1573 says something about a new it file
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
management system and it doesn't have a
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
a fancy uh systems name so so I wonder
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
is that going to be a roll your own
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
thing or are we going to implement a
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
change in an existing system and we just
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
didn't name
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
it so currently we're we were evaluating
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
um utilizing either New Heights our
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system or our
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
bridges system for children youth and
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
families however upon looking at the
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill we also identified that both of
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
those Solutions do not have this file
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
management certification process in them
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
so they would be a new lift for either
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
of those systems or a brand new one and
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
that is what we're updating on the um
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
updating updated fiscal note that would
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
be presented back to
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
you um I know I didn't answer your
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
question directly the the reality is we
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
we believe we we would need a new system
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
to provide this
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
service okay so would you build the
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
system or would you buy the
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
system um our normal practice following
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
dit's direction is to buy the system
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
instead of build it and in terms of buy
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
it would be putting it out to bid and
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
getting a getting a vendor to vendors to
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
respond with their solutions for the
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
system so so um I'm just going to check
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
that real quick because um that that had
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
a relatively short fuse suggested
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
implementation date or effective date um
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh sections six through uh nine go into
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
effect July one of this year and the
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
remainder in January of 25 and if you've
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
got a go contract for a new it system uh
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
the question would be could this program
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
really go live without the it support or
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
would we be creating other problems now
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of a unwieldy question
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe you can't answer but it it's
 
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
a concern of mine that if if we we we
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
can't go live in practice unless you've
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
got the right support so um do you do
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
you have a feeling of that should we be
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
back

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of moving forward with a new
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
solution that requires an IT system to
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
be effective at monitoring and and and
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
in not in managing and sharing that
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
information effectively I would suggest
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
moving the date back so that we would
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
have time to um requ do go out to RFP
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
and implement the solution which is a
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
about 9 to 12 month time frame for us to
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
do that based off of our procurement
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
practices so my request there is not for
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
an answer now
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
other than I mean you you told me what I
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
needed to know but to try to come back
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
Monday and maybe this is too quick if
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
you could sort of thumb wrestle this a
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more so we know what your
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
strategy would be and what your
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be on on a
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
different implementation
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
date fair enough we will definitely do
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
that we we'll get the analysis and do
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
that work this week and have something
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
for you on Monday okay so uh represent
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
ho your just for clarity you mentioned
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
four bills I believe in the very
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
beginning right that you were discussing
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I captured
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
which four bills they were I I think I
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
said there were five uh bills that had
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
it implications on them and I can I can
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah just so you want me to read those
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
1573

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.130 align:start position:0%
1573
 
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
1573
[Music]

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
1669

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
1282

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
1564 and
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
1595 you and and then I I I have not
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
looked yet at the other Bill
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative Earth have have you
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill that we haven't
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
looked at yet I've looked at the bill
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
but I haven't paid attention to whether
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
it requires doit work okay do you recall
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
the number the of the bill
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
1363 1563 13 oh 15 13 133 13 63 13 63
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
okay so um so could you take a look at
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
1363 as well for Monday to tell us you
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if it has an IT
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
implication or not but it if it does
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's the same general set of questions
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
about do you have the capacity to do it
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
and what's kind of timeline would be
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
rational we will add that to the list
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
so we're what we're doing now is we're
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to focus on the it thread
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
all the way through these bills so that
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
we can let Mr weers go back to work
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
because uh I know uh he he's got tons of
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
it um is there anyone on the committee
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
that has any questions related to the it
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
bills do you have any words of wisdom
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
leave I reserve those for the members of
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
this committee but thank you very much
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
so so just how about an update a really
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
quick update H how are you doing overall
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
implementing all of the Commissioners
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
priorities are you do you have a backlog
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
in projects or are you guys on top of it
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
are you ahead of schedule or behind
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
schedule generally I would say in
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
general we're on schedule I wouldn't say
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're ahead of schedule of every project
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're ahead on some and we're on
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
schedule for others there's of course
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
some projects that we put on hold based
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
off of resources being focused on some
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
other efforts um but when it comes to
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
behind schedule um anything that would
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
be in our project management portfolio
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
indicating um behind schedule we address
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
with risk mitigation and identify how to
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
get them back on yeah where possible
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so what I'm hearing is we do have
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
some projects that are identified to
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
support commissioner strategic plan that
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
are on hold due to Resource limitations
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
and we could potentially be dropping
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
five more projects on you without
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
appreciating the relative priorities of
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
those other on hold
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
projects thank you for the clarification
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative the um as
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
it relates to the commissioner's
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
strategic plan we are on target for all
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
of those items we do have additional
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
projects that are it addition to the
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan that may be put on hold
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
at different points in time to support
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
the Strategic plan but I don't see any
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
issues with the current strategic plan
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
and unless Nathan has additional
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
information that's outstanding thank you
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
um that that that's all I have on it I
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't see any other
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions thanks for coming by good
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
seeing you again thank you very much
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
you okay with that I think we can go to
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh house one and um so we're starting it
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit late but but I think being
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
out of sequence will help us overall who
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
who's who's up to introduce uh 1588
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%

jurisdiction uh representative long said

questions this is just a performa
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and I am um
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
here to introduce House Bill
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
1588 um for representative long who is
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
the U Prime sponsor and this bill
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
pertains to uh Court jurisdiction over
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
persons receiving special
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
education uh thank you for that uh is
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
there anyone from the public Miss
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg do do you happen to know
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
this hi Karen Rosenberg from the
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center I think that
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is an effort that perhaps the
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
school district attorneys would want to
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
speak about um because think that they
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
worked with representative long on this
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill I can tell you I can give you some
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
background about what it I'm aware I'm
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with it so when the legislature
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
changed the eligibility for special
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
education for students with disabilities
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
to make the maximum age 22 the day
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
before they turned 22 as opposed to what
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
it was 21 um the provisions in the
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile laws that that address
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
continuing jurisdiction for students
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
with disabilities were not similarly
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
amended to reflect the change in the
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility for special education and so
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
what can happen is for students that are
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
in one of the 169 BC or D programs if
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
they have a disability and get their
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
Educational Services and residential
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
services a lot of times or intensive
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services through their
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
Court involvement if they if this law is
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
not amended when they turn
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
21 they will not have the opportunity to
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
extend their jurisdiction so that they
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
could continue getting those additional
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
supports um and what we've seen in our
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
office is that there are students who
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
like don't have a home to go back to
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they were at Easter Seals
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential program for example and
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
they're 21 years old they haven't
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
finished their high school programs
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
because they haven't earned a
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
diploma they turn if they're they
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
because of like an abuse and neglect
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
case turned 21
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
then they are unable to finish their
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
education programs because there's not
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
like a day a place for them to live to
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
finish those programs so it's a small
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
number of kids I think who are affected
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
or 32 is what got cited in the fiscal
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
note that I I have no idea that sounds
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
about right but I don't know is is there
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
anyone from the legal society that you
 
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.909 align:start position:0%
anyone from the legal society that you
just

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I don't think they consider
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
themselves a society but there's a law
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
firm that was working on it
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't see them okay
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
so so I I representative long and I
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
talked last night and he's got uh some
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
family issues he's taken care of and he
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
thought uh he could have a
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative here as well as um
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who had looked at this three
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
people he said worked on it extensively
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
from like a legal perspective really
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
attorney Jared zelen worked on it a lot
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
he with Drummond Woods um I don't see
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%

and if you want to respond to any of
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
them you're welcome to if you if you if
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
you don't feel like they're in your lane
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
you you don't have to perfect okay so as
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
I look at this bill I I I look that it's
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
32 individuals is there anyone from the
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
Department here ready to talk about this
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
yeah come on up I'm so sorry I
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
overlooked your your do do you want me
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
to stick around or no go ahead yeah it's
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're having a friendly team
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
day good afternoon Susan larby general
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
counsel for DCF so I was looking at the
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note as well and trying to
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that those numbers and is
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
that your question I'm about to get
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
there yeah is there anything you want to
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
say overall programmatically before I I
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
start drilling into
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
it no not at this time okay so so my
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
concern as I look at this is that it
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
seeks to service an additional 32 kids
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
and it overall there's a request for
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
four additional
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
FTE the FTE are two additional DHHS
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
employees somebody from Child Protective
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
Services somebody from the juvenile
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
probation and parole office so that's
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
that's four people to handle 32 more
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
cases and it's
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
generating uh an an estimate of of about
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
say we'll call it 1.65 million to as
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
high as 5.76 million and so uh if you
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
want to just sit at the end there Mr
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
White and you can use that microphone it
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's just an
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
enormous range and I don't understand
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
why we would have such a huge
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
range good afternoon members of the
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee Nathan white Chief Financial
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
Officer um chairman Edwards if if the
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
committee turns to the last page of the
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill um or uh to the fiscal note the
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
last page that's probably the best place
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
to start so we're assuming that there
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
would be an additional 32
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
individuals um that that would still
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
fall under this this particular section
 
00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:48.269 align:start position:0%
fall under this this particular section
of

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
Statute and as a result of that we made
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
two assumptions here or several
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
assumptions um one is we assumed 22
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
would still remain within child
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
protection and 11 would be within the
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system and you'll see
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
in the table the position costs those
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
are for three positions um it's the
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
second to last line there uh two of
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
which would be working within child
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
protection system one would be jpo to
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
cover the additional increase in case
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
load um the other costs that you're
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
seeing there um relative to the total
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
1.6 million estimated in fiscal year
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
25 the residential cost so last budget
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
cycle we talked a lot about the
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
residential contracts and the additional
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that this committee had
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
made towards that um that's the cost
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
that we estimate where we would need
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
additional funds to pay for children
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
that were in those Residential Treatment
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
um facilities um the communitybased
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
services those those are services that
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
that are provided um to children and we
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
have a number of existing contracts and
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's the estimate um based on the best
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
information that we have at this point
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
in time um where we would see an
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
increase in cost there and then we have
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
that onetime Bridges system New Heights
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
update for the
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
$100,000 that that helps us get to that
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
million I missed the it the new new
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
heights uh is it where is it written
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
that I just I overlooked it oh there
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's right there last page on the in the
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
table Yeah I just see it now so I would
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
ask Mr weer about that too because that
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
makes six of these that has uh it
 
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.110 align:start position:0%
makes six of these that has uh it
implications

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
implications
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay can somebody get that to Mr weers
 
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.470 align:start position:0%
okay can somebody get that to Mr weers
all

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
right all right
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
um is there is there anyone who can
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the to the question that given
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
that it's so many new people it's three
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
it I you thank you for correcting me I I
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
I just wrote wrote a bad note so it was
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
three um this says it goes into effect
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
60 days after its passage uh if it's
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
going to require an upgrade to or an
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
update to new heights you know it's it's
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
the you know which comes first uh
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
question and I think the system may need
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
to be updated
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
before uh the this program should be
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
expected to start so I I think I think
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
if the department could just take go
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
back and look at at what the it
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
implementation expectations would be and
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
when the go live expectations would be
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
then we could adjust the the the write
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
up there absolutely I I think another
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
thing to consider here um if if we're
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
looking to get as accurate as possible
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
as as we evaluate this is if we look at
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
um the position costs as well um because
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes July 1 and it takes
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days later we have to
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
internally go through the process of
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
formally establishing the positions and
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have to work with the Department
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
administrative services to do that then
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
post the jobs and then hire them um so
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
if if we do um if the committee does
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
consider pushing out the effective go
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
live date I think we should also keep
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
that particular element of this in mind
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the appropriation that that'
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
be great so so all of that could
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
potentially change this fiscal note
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
again perhaps in the first year but in
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
the long run we'd still have a long-term
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
impact right are are there questions
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee on 1588 go ahead
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative wner thank you um I guess
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
this is for Mr White all of these
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
children are presently in
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
residential care at this
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
time my understanding is that this
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
estimate was based on the on the numbers
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
that we have today that that would Age
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
into this if this bill were passed okay
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
so they they are all in so don't all of
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
these children already
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
have um a juvenile
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
justice provider service
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
provider yes but we would have other
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
children that would be coming into the
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
system so we'd be expanding the overall
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
need of the system um and to do so
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
without having the additional resources
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
to do so may not be
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
prudent do does anyone know what the
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
officer I don't have that information
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
today is that possible to get that
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
maybe the and the number of juvenile
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
service officers we have and what the
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
point thank you of
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
course I I think those those are great
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions because if we're adding
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
basically 32 on top as an increment I it
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
just makes me wonder what the actual
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
work is per individual and whether that
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
adds up to two more CPS people and
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
another juvenile uh go ahead
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative H thank you chairman I'm
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
not sure who at DHHS could answer this
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
but I believe there are currently a
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
waiting list for Hampstead Hospital in
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
the same age group through 18 is that
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the the weight list fluctuates day
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
by day I I would have to find the most
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
updated information because some days we
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't have weight list other days we do
 
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.149 align:start position:0%
don't have weight list other days we do
is

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
there if we spent money over there would
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
that solve some of the weight list
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
issues is it a capacity issue of the
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
staff are we talking about child
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
protection or are we talking about
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital I'm a little confused
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital relative to juveniles
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
who might be coming through the the

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
Care well welcome Miss
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
Tilly good morning you've got the JV
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
team my name is Patricia Tilly I'm an
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner with the
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
fairly new to this work so I don't have
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
all the answers for you right now
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
representative um I would just note um I
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
think your thought is great around
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead but I would note that these
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
kiddos in these youth young adults that
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
are in residential care may not be
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for hamstad care they may
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
not have a psychiatric diagnosis that
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate so that's really
 
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
the main point that I would put in this
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
um and again to the point that the
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
weight list does vary day by day but we
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
are generally close to full it is mostly
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing thank you I I realize that this
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
is not so much about that those would
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
need juvenile Services through Hamstead
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
the reason I was asking is given
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
spending of a versus B if we have
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 who are
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
waiting are on a wait list at to
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampstead that might be a higher
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
consider did did you you moved do you
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
have a question or comment I have a
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
comment if that's okay um so a lot of
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
these children have development
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities and are also eligible um
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
potentially for services under one of
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
our 1915c Medicaid waiver programs and
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
so when you're considering what the
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is it one way or another
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the department will probably be
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
helping to support the res if they need
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
Residential Services it would still be
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
funded in part by the department so I'm
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
not sure that it's a dollar for dooll
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
amount that that would be you know
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
caused by Chang changing the law in this
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
fashion the difference is that it would
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
enable these students to be able to
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
continue to reside if they're in
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
residential programs to reside at those
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
residential schools um Because unless
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
the court extends the jurisdiction then
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
there won't be a funding mechanism for
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that because the
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
1915c waiver funds cannot be used for a
 
00:36:18.319 --> 00:36:23.230 align:start position:0%
1915c waiver funds cannot be used for a
residential

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
school just a quick one so so I'm having
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
a hard time wrapping my head around the
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
fact that these folks exist with these
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
needs and they're part at least
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
partially in the system are they just
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
not getting services I don't I don't
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
quite understand if they're I'm sorry if
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
you finish no no I was basically done
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
good Interruption go ahead so um you
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
know I this is not necessarily all the
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
children but some of the children that
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
or young adults that have come through
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
our office are um students who have
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities that are
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
pretty significant and they're also
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
connected they are in the um abuse and
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
neglect system and they are duly
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for developmental Services
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
Under the waiver as well as school
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
services so and and there are there
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's been litigation around um you
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
know what the obligations are for
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
students right now um and that's
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
something that's sort of current being
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
hashed out a bit I mean although so
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit complicated but um
 
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:33.230 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit complicated but um
either

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
way um what we're talking about our
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
students who are going to benefit from
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
continuing to receive their services
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
where they are as opposed to having to
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
leave where they are to go into Adult
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
Services if they were to drop out of
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
school uh thank you there several people
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
have walked in would you to take a look
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
around to see if the folks from from
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
that Law Group are now in the room no no
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
we're done and let them know you thank
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
could we could you make sure you talk to
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple to so that we I will give him

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
personally will give Jerry zelen a call
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney who's been involved with
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
this okay I I think um representative
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
long really wanted us to hear from them
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
so so representative Mooney and then
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative ver thank you very much
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here as a point of
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
historical reference this change in
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
eligibility to the age of 22 was that
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
implemented just last term well actually
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
was implemented in two stages um last
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
term there was actually was two terms
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
ago that there was a bill that was
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
passed actually the House and Senate
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
both passed the same bill to raise the
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
age to 22 last session there was like a
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill because there were a couple
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
areas of Education law that didn't get
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
amended when the definition of child
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
with a disability was changed to add up
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
inclusive thank
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
you so I'm probably a little dense um
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
but not so these kids these people are
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
currently in the the system and
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
currently in residential Andor Community
 
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
currently in residential Andor Community
Based

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Based
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
Services I'm still not clear given that
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm still not clear on why there's such
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
a wide range of possible costs when you
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
now um representative Earth so if we
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
have a population of individuals in the
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
system today and one year goes by and if
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
this bill were passed they would still
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
be within the system and we would still
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
have those costs we're assuming ass
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
uming though that we're going to have
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the same behind there increase you know
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
as people age into the system or come
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
into the system I I I don't see this as
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
being uh net neutral because we're
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
basically expanding the total
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the system um and our
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
assumption and and we basically straight
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
lined it going forward so individuals
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the system that
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
would no longer be in the system that's
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
the that's the the 32 figure that you
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
see we're assuming there would be an
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
equal number coming in there so so when
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're when we are developing this fiscal
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
note and we're looking at okay from a
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
ratio perspective if the number if this
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
if the Staffing number and I still need
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
to confirm this I believe jppo is 1 to
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
11 and Child Protection is 1 to 10 we
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
would assume we would assume we need
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
that same number of staff and then the
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
res the res rate and the Community Based
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
Services we're also assuming based on U
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
utilization ratios today X number would
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
be in residentials treatment which would
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
cost x amount per person and X number
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
would be in commun would be receiving
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
Community Based
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
Services I would just also add that the
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
real if you look at the fiscal note the
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
real differences come in the cost of
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
residential care so Staffing Community
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
Based Services those those may be
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
different um but it's really the Acuity
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
of the care that that the individual may
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
need and so those costs can be variable
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
depend on the need of the um
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
youth okay so I was only looking at both
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
because those are the two actually vary
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
and and I understand the most of them
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
are residential um I guess I'm still
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
curious as to how this range is coming
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
into place I mean you could come up with
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
an average right now which if you
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
multiplied that out would give you a one
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
number um is it is is the range of
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
Acuity so incredibly variable that you
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
wind up in a situation like
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
H we can go back and have further
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
conversations about that but and and
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
determine if we can understand that a
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more but I think what we were
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
trying to express is that there they are
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
very varable based on the needs and
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
based on the uh facilities in which we
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
Treatment okay so here's one way you
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
could look at it when you kid kids start
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
at a pretty young age in these programs
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
assume again it depends on the need okay
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
but you have kids in a range of Ages
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
across the program yes okay and you have
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
kids in a range of Acuity across correct
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
the program so you do have some idea of
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
the average of Acuity and therefore the
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
average of cost if you're looking at the
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
whole program and not just these 32
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
kids we can go back and look at that in
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail thank you and
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
Monday representative Murray thank you
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I know I'm the sub but I'm
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
just real curious about something uh
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
when this bill passed two years ago or
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
so you know to move the age from 21 to
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
22 wasn't there a fiscal note attached
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
to that addressing what y'all are
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
talking about now and when I was looking
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
at this I was assuming that this is more
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
changing the statutes to address things
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
that got dripped behind and I'm curious
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
ious about why would there be a new
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note assuming that with when it
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago there was an
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate fiscal note at that
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
time may I summarize your question a
 
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.990 align:start position:0%
time may I summarize your question a
little

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
differently M Mr White is this money
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
already in the budget
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
and no we're we're this this bill would
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
expand the population of individuals
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
that would be eligible to receive
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
Services I think that's key and I think
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing our assumption
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
that there will be an increase in
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
residential treatment utilization
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be an increase in case load
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
which is why we would need the
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
additional positions followup yeah thank
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
you um just curious wouldn't you have
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
predicted the increase in students when
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
the bill was passed two years ago you
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
would have assumed that there would be
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
students that are aging out of this I'm
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
process

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record I'm
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ross the director of The Bureau
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health um and
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
previously General councel and
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
legislatively as um for dcyf when this
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
bill was originally brought two years
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
ago to make the change to the special
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
education and educational system
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
structure there was not a corresponding
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
change for the Department related
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
services so those were were not included
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note or the Appropriations
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is to catch up with that
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
understand all right so um are there any
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
other questions on
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
1588 is is there anyone Miss Tilly that
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
wise I have very little wise things to
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
tell you but you did ask ask about the
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
CPS number or the numbers um for case
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
loads CPS assessment is about um eight
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
um case loads CPS family service 13 jppo
 
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.910 align:start position:0%
um case loads CPS family service 13 jppo
is

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
15 and so those are numbers of
 
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.670 align:start position:0%
15 and so those are numbers of
individual

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
cases yes that is the number of cases
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
each individual would would typically
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
have or have on average now so an
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
argument could are could you make the
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
argument here that you're using a
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
conservative ative number for these
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
additional two people because it's 16
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you for CPS assessment folks
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
it is they have a case load of eight CPS
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
family service they have a average case
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
load of 13 cases for jppo average case
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
15 any other questions
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
comments yes you have a comment I can't
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
help myself I mean another thing to keep
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
in mind is that the overall goal for the
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
Department that's been expressed
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
multiple times is to reduce the use of
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
institutional placements of children so
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
although these students may be you know
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
residing in residential schools and
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
require that the hope is and where I
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
understand the department is going is to
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
try to reduce the um our dependence and
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
Reliance on institutional placements for
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
kids so that might be something to
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
factor into this as well as the we don't
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
know that 100% of the students who turn
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
21 are going to want to take advantage
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
of extending the Court's Jurisdiction to
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know not everyone wants to be under
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
Court's Jurisdiction just another thing
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind as you weigh through all
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
of this thank you okay uh well thank you
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
for that and um with that I'm going to
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
conclude House Bill
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
1588 and I'm ready to move on to
 
00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:31.630 align:start position:0%
1588 and I'm ready to move on to
1598

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
1598
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill um this bill the prime
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor is someone we all know
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
representative walner and what she and I
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
talked about um is that uh she's going
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and introduce the bill um
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
and not um and and not take questions I
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't want her to take questions so she
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
can return as a member of the committee
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
and and ask her questions there um and I
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess I should have done this so
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
so you're starting clean on 1598 and
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative hle has the prior Bill
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
um go go ahead are you ready to you you
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
there House Bill
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
there House Bill
1598

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
1598
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
addresses um a concern that has come
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward and I think I've been here for a
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
long time and I don't think I was even
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
clear that this was happening
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
um when children go into foster care or
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
care of by the state when the state
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
takes um jurisdiction and um takes the
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
care of children if a child enters that
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
system and they have a Social Security
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
Disability um payment or because they
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
themselves have a
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
disability or their parent has a
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
disability or in some cases children's
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
parents have died and they don't um have
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
they are receiving uh some sort of a
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
death benefit from their family for
 
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.309 align:start position:0%
death benefit from their family for
their

00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
family and
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
there are though I don't know how many
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
of these we have or if we have had any
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
at all and I hope we haven't had
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
children who have had to go into child
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
placement whose family have had um whose
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
parent has been a veteran who may have
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
who may have um died in service um and
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
so they would receive a veteran's
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
benefit for that um we the state is
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
taking those payments and actually
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
accounts as opposed to setting those
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
payments up for the children a lot of
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
these kids when they age out of foster
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
care or Residential Care um they have no
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
family to go back to they have no
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
resources um you know who they are they
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
end up children that young people who
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
end up
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
homeless they have no car to get to work
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
they have no way of continuing their
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
education um and so what this bill does
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
is um stop that practice of um the state
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
taking those uh
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
payments there is now a new fiscal note
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
which I think will be uh passed out the
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
first fiscal note
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
was fairly
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
amazing um but there is a new fiscal
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
note which I'm sure the department will
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
be able to explain and and talk
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
about it it feels like this is happening
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
all over the country many of the states
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
are doing this they're moving this way
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
um and the federal government is
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually um encouraging states to move
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
away from holding taking these uh
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
benefits from the children and putting
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
them into the state's account to cover
 
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
their foster care or their parts of
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
their Residential Care
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll just leave it at that
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
I've got all kind I've got loads of um
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
articles and information from other
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
states I've looked at a number of states
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
this the um bill before you was actually
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
modeled after the Arizona model the
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
Arizona uh legislation so um and I'm
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
glad to provide any and all of that if
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
people want to ask me about getting some
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
of those articles and some of those
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
other States I'd be glad to get them for
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
them okay uh thank you is there somebody
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
from the Department that wants to speak
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill you basically you know how how how
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
do you all see the problem and how do
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
solution and and the number of children
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be affected good question go
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
ahead and chairman Edwards for the
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
record John Williams I'm Le director of
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for Health Human
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
Services and with me is Attorney Laura
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
young I'm litigation Council for the
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
Services and everybody knows U our Chief
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
Way well uh chairman Edwards I just want
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
to start off in terms of the financial
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done uh on the leg on
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill we completely
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand the goals of the Prime
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor and we certainly work hard to
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
try to come up with solutions to some of
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
the barriers that have uh come up one of
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have is that we have
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
identified the need for additional
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources within the department
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to actually do what the bill
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
is requiring us to do uh we do currently
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
have a policy in place uh that is at
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
least dated as of December 2022 uh that
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
identifies that we do assist in the
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
application process for these benefits
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
under Social Security Administration and
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
Veterans uh Affairs benefits uh for
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
children who are disabled or have
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
disabled parents or the parents are
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
deceased so we do have some uh level of
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
assistance that we're providing to those
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
individuals but the scope of this
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
legislation would expand it to all
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
children within our our category of
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
placement with the um department and
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's a sizable number and because of
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
it we need the resources to be able to
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
actually actively not only work on the
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
application process but the legal issues
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
that also come related to that including
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to appeals before the Social
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
Security Administration it would also
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
require us as part of our exercise to
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
place the money that we'd be receiving
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
in essentially a trust for the child we
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we do things well and we
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
protect assets and that's why we have
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
some of the most stringent Probate Court
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
laws uh here in the nation and it's one
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we would need legal
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
support to be able to manage those funds
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh additionally around that that's kind
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
of the big picture where our we're
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
running up against some issues around
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
Staffing and would need those resources
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the the other piece of this uh is the
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
loss potentially of the title for E
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
funding in foster care it's a balancing
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
out between um uh deciding to utilize
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
either SSA veterans benefits or the
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
title for E funding for purposes of the
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
cost of placement for for these children
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of complexities that
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
are involved we we were looking into
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
working with The Advocates I will say
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire legal assistance
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
and also the disabilities rights Center
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
have been particularly helpful in the
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
conversation uh around this but one of
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
the issues is how could we reduce the
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
cost if we could identify an entity
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the department to take over
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
essentially acting as a guardian on
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of the J at least administration
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
of of these funds so I'm going to stop
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
with that and ask attorney uh Lori Young
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
who's actually the expert next to the
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
person who at least knows the high level
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh for any additional commentary and
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts in terms of some of the
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
challenges that we faced in terms of
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
trying to identify making this workable
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh but at the end of the day uh
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
regrettably it is a sizable amount of
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
money even with the Revis fiscal
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
analysis provided by the department
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
which Mr Ripple was kind enough to
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
provide to you in your your packet here
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh today so so so I just want to make
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
sure that uh for the committee
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
everyone's looking at the new fiscal
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
note 24-
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
2311 is is that that's the right one
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
right 2311 it should say revised today
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
yeah revised today
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
um okay and I don't I don't know that I
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
heard a number of U people that would
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
change representative Edwards um I I can
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
speak if if it'd be helpful relative to
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
the number um or the numbers if if it's
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee to understand
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
the update fiscal note um which which
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
may help inform um and and and address
 
00:56:33.549 --> 00:56:33.559 align:start position:0%
your question in
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
directly the new fiscal note dated
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
3624 uh that is before you so as as John
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
had indicated um this new bill would
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
require that we determine whether every
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
child coming into the system is eligible
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
for SSA or veterans benefits that is not
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
something that we do today there'd also
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
be a require
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh every year that we would continue to
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
check that again that is not something
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
that that we currently do today and
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
relative and I I'll let the attorneys
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
here at the table speak to some of the
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
complexities uh relative to page one
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
trusts today we currently um use the SSI
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
benefits that um and and representative
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
walner we do have an update in the
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal note there are actually
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
individual accounts for each child in
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
which we receive the SSI funds and those
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
funds today are used to pay for the
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
services that those children receive and
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
so that's approximately in and we were
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
able to run uh State fiscal year 23
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
numbers with the additional time that
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
that we received and today um for for
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
safe fiscal year 23 it was approximately
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
$1.4 million in
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
SSI uh Revenue that we used to offset
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
General funds the second component an
 
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.230 align:start position:0%
General funds the second component an
additional

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.109 align:start position:0%
additional
$773,000

00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
$773,000
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
um So currently we're claiming title 4E
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
for about 25 children a quarter and if
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
we were to um receive SSI benefits for
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
those children on their behalf we would
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
no longer be able to claim that
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
73,000 estimated annually um in title 4E
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
so in total we the state would uh
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
increase its general fund needs or
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
obligation by about $2.1 million
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
annually in addition to the the uh the
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
resources that would' be needed um to
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
conduct the evaluations and and I don't
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
know if you want to speak to some of the
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
complexities yeah so you will notice in
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
the the bill it identifies several ways
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about uh
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
safeguarding the funds for these
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
children children there's several
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
identified ways they give examples of a
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
Special Needs Trust of a stable or able
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
account of a pooled trust all of these
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
options are are very good in
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
safeguarding they're also complexity in
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the legality of making sure they're
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
done correctly and they're done
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
correctly for each child because each
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
child could have a different need and
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
what they might uh need in the future
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then also how many benefits they're
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
getting and the reason it's important
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
the Safeguard is because each one of
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
these kids are going to be on a
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
different type of benefit most of them
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
are me test for example Medicaid we want
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure and ensure that we are have
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
that adequately protected so that we
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't end up
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
um going over the means test and then
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
having those benefits go away the the
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
complexity of each one of those is it's
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
not a one-size fits-all and then
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
additionally for each one of those
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
options you have to have someone that
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
manages those funds for a special need
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
trust that's a trustee a pool trust that
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
has an organization that does that like
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
in our state ELO Enhanced Life options
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
or for a stable account you have to have
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
someone who is overseeing that account
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
and making sure is being used in the
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate ways because there are a lot
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
of rules about how money can be used in
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
these protected areas and if you allow
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
misuse of that for example if it's used
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
for rent or food that can actually
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
invalidate the entire protection and so
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's ongoing responsibilities that
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
require a lot of legal um oversight to
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
right okay just just a heads up on what
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do we I I don't know that
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to finish all the questions
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
on 1598 uh so we may recess
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
1598 to start talking about
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
1573 because
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
1573 includes some funds for the
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and division one has
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
interrupted their meetings to come over
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
here so that they can jointly hear this
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
with us so so what I what I think I
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
heard you say in
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
summary is that every kid who's already
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
coming through the system is it's the
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
same kid but we're now going to be
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
taking a look to see if we should be
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
setting up a particularly specialized
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
account for them but I'm still not
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
hearing an estimate of how many of those
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
kids are going to need one of these
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.470 align:start position:0%
kids are going to need one of these
accounts

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think that goes into the point about
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
the eligibility that this requires an
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for every kid coming in and
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
we don't do that currently so so we have
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
a population number that we're going to
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
be looking at that seems to be the same
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
number that we're going to be looking at
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
in the future and then if we could just
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
apply a reasonable
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
percentage you like 50% of them are
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to need a special account 20% I
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
mean then we can start to wrap our head
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
around the volume of of accounts that
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
will be established so there there's
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,500 children coming into
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the system every quarter okay but you
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
have I think what's really important to
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
recognize is that doesn't mean there's
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
6,000 new children every year because
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
some may be that that that figure um may
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
include duplicates so to speak if you go
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
from one quarter to the next so I think
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
1500 is a conservative safe estimate but
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's likely more annually that will get
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
reviewed but do 100% of them need one of
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
these accounts established or is it a
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
subset they and I'm I I'm going to post
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
postpone the answer to the question I'm
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
also going to ask the question of is
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
this going to require any it
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
implementations or upgrades because it
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like it's a very specific
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
very fiduciary intensive accounting
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be done and it's hard to
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
imagine that we haven't been doing this
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
yet these systems are already done so
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any it in
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
here so so I'm GNA I'm going to go ahead
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
and um put put 1598 at recess uh for 30
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
minutes wait wait a second do you have
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
something we're okay can you keep track
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
of your question all right so um 1598 is
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh with that I'll go ahead and open um
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
our discussion on uh HB
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
1573 we have the prime sponsor
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson here

pleasure go ahead and begin talking

the bill or the amendment or both
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman after last
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
fall scandal at the bledo Academy of
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
Gallatin Tennessee where two New
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children had been placed in
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
what turned out to be horrifying
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
conditions the desire emerged to make
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
some changes in how the placement of
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
children with behavioral problems would
 
01:05:10.279 --> 01:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
children with behavioral problems would
take

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
place house bill 1573 in its original
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
form was quickly and at the deadline
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
filed as a
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
placeholder the office of the child
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
advocate and the children and Behavioral
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
Health and DCF of the Department of
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services groups with
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
overlapping jurisdictions began the task
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
of determining what those changes would
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
be and much to my enjoyment all those
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
groups came within 95% of each other on
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
what the changes should
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
be therefore two separate amendments
 
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
were crafted and the children and family
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
law committee unanimously accepted
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
0427 because we concluded of the two
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendments it gave better flexibility
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
and greater speed for the handful of
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
Youth needing highly Specialized
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
Care the bill is amended so pause
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm a little thick so so
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that we have now that's 24
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
2149 already includes amendment 0427 in
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
it yes okay okay it replaced the entire
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
placeholder bill it okay so this is the
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
bill okay and and so then um all right
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
and so you're going you haven't yet
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned 0980 not yet all right thank
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
you so the bill is amended pass children
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
and family law on February 6th with a
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
vote of 16 to Zer and pass the house on
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
February 22nd on a Voice vote giving you
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
the bill you
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
have I realized there are many
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislators who believe there is a huge
 
01:06:59.789 --> 01:06:59.799 align:start position:0%
pot of gold kicking
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
around fewer of us realized that if we
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
added up what everybody wanted from that
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
pot of money the expenditures would be
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
multiple times of the real amount of
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
money which is just a simple way of
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
saying that while the chairman knows I'm
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
the liberal arts guy who pulls people
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
from their silos to craft great ideas
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not a money person I know you are
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
the financial gurus who know how to make
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
great ideas play out and we'll look at
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
this bill with a down the road look at
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
where we could be when we craft the next
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
budget but also a right now idea of what
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
next step or two we can realistically
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
take with a little bit of money that we
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
could ask for and I've spoken with
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards and chairman Wier to
 
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards and chairman Wier to
this

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
effect the amendment just given to you
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
0980 H was just finished yesterday with
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
input from Office of the child advocate
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
Services as to further
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
refinements Lisa masio from OCA and
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
Christa Morris from DHHS could expand on
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
this new amendment I will just say in
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
closing that the changes enshrined in
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
will better help our children in need
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
and better do the oversight we give them
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
so problems like what we had with bledo
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
won't happen
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so so it sounds to me like what
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
you're ultimately recommending by
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
implication is that the finance
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee um adopt this new Amendment uh
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
09 980 which is a complete replacement
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
of everything that the house voice voted
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's a complete one a
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
complete replace all it is tweakings of
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
sections okay but the ones who actually
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
crafted this amendment for me would
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
better speak to that okay so so no one I
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
haven't uh had the opportunity to read
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
and think about this new Amendment
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
neither have I so so I don't know how
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
good we're going to be at asking
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
question questions um and we may have to
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh bring you back bring people back on
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon after we've had an
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at this and digest
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
it so understood but may I suggest that
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended prior to getting
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
this new amendment is the gist of it it
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
is the the the big idea the what do we
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
do now to make things better with
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
98 something
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
980 being tweakings but yeah I'll take
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
you point and I'll come back if you need
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
me to okay and I think I heard you say
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
that children and family law didn't look
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
at the money at all that that that
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's been delegated or or passed over
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
to us to to to to do the complete
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
financial review well trying to be
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
flattering the reason is that you guys
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
are the money people okay no I just I'm
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure we understand
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
we wanted the policy we discussed the
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
policy we discussed what went wrong what
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
could go better that's what we really
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
worked long and hard on okay so from a
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
policy perspective um it it it it feels
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
to me like this bill creates u a very u
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
a much more intensive active uh
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
inspection intervention where our case
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
workers maintain their individual
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with the patients that are
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
out out of state and that on a periodic
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
basis at least once a month I uh go down
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
and physically check their status uh and
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
as a result we have a fairly significant
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh requirement in the bill as as as
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
presented of uh taking a lot of Manpower
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
and having them travel on the road uh
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
focused on on an on-site inspection and
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
a return with all the documentation that
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the operational burden uh
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill and that you
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
imposing a new contractual requirement
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
in here as well so I assume the
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
contractual requirement is meant to um
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
establish specific care standards uh for
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh the contractor yes the only thing I
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
would add to that is if we deem the
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
number of visits per year to be X yeah
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
and we can't get there right now but
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
maybe in the new budget we can we'll
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
take half x 2/3 x 1/3x it is the money
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
that you folks in finance deem you can
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
provides from what we have now to to do
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
better what we've been doing so so you'd
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
be okay if we proposed a half X solution
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'd be thrilled it's better than what we
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
have all right so so as an alternative a
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
strategic policy alternative instead of
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
sort of this intense sending of of
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
people to on site did you consider um U
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
at a contractual level obligating a
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
level of care and then sending somebody
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
down to audit the contract and
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
Sample the the delivery of the contract
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
as a less expensive but possibly as
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
effective approach to this bill giving
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
that it is the people behind me who do
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
this and understand this and given the
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
fact here we are now and aspirationally
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
here where we'd like to be we would be
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
very happy for finance to put a spot on
 
01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
very happy for finance to put a spot on
that

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
Journey okay it so we'll we do you have
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
anything are there any questions for
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson she I'm looking at her or did
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
walner I guess what I would like to know
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
maybe this is more for the chair than um
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
for representative Pearson but I would
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
like someone to walk through the changes
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
from the bill that was voted on the
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
floor to the amendment since Finance is
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to be coming out well probably
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
maybe uh finance will be coming out with
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment that changes policy and I'd
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
like to know what it is we're changing I
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
would would be extremely happy to answer
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
that through the people sitting behind
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
me that's what I thought you'd
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
say maybe LBA could make us side by
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
side I'm sure they would agree does it
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
need our LBA left so good timing they
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent guire uh so so keep that in
 
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
mind until Mr Ripple while you were out
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the room representative McGuire put
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
some more work on you what what would
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
you do you want to turn on your mic and
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative walner wanted
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
to know the difference between the
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and the bill is
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
passed by the house so I was saying
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you could make a side by side to
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
do that I can do that all right thank
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
you can you do that by Monday afternoon
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple because that's when we're
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
going to rehear this all right um Mr
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
chair okay um go ahead keep in mind we
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
do not even have a fiscal note an
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
amended fiscal note for what we passed
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that's a that's a good new Point
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairman this becomes a
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
bit of a chicken and an egg we can't
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
give a fiscal note if we don't know what
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
you're willing to agree to maybe you
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're willing to agree
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
to until you see a fiscal note all right
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure that's I think our
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
process is more sequential than that but
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
well that's cuz you're not a liberal
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
arts guy like I am yeah represent H
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you than you Mr chair um I assume
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
some others are going to come speak to
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um am I correct in assuming
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
that there there are more people here
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
already to come speak okay because I
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
would like to know how many children are
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
involved in this that that's a fine
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
question now for our new division one
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
guests um the original Bill had expanded
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
the Manpower in the Judiciary I don't
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
know if you've noticed that in the um in
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that we have in front of
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
us I don't know if that fiscal note is
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
still at all relevant but um on the
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
second to last page at the bottom they
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
they they think we need to add two
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
judges and seven people in the clerk's
 
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.440 align:start position:0%

DHHS okay so I I did are you familiar
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or or not yes I am
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
okay are you able to uh at least
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
partially address representative
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
wahner's question about
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
what is in the amendment that changes
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that was voted on by the house
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
what the specific changes were sure
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
there are a few items one includes the
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
purpose and findings and that was to
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
include some um language that is more in
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
line with the federal standards
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
regarding kin
 
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.030 align:start position:0%
regarding kin
and

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
um and treatment and then also we remove
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
the word qualified because that does not
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
really mean anything outside of funding
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
for for uh certain types of facilities
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
and not all facilities are considered
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
qualified that is just for foster care
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
title 4 funding so we removed that to
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
allow us to have a larger breadth of of
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
facilities we could send youth to we
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
also have uh I'm
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chair no could you ask if we
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
could get line references where she's
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
talking about oh I'm sorry yeah that
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
yes so the purpose and finding that was
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
so start with the first point you made
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
um this one I might actually phone a
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
friend and ask the OCA to come
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
up whatever you needo yeah if they're
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
here let's do
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
it and then you could sit at the end of
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
that table if you want and use that mic
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
right there just introduce yourself so
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
record sorry I don't mean to be lurking
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
behind you
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
guys Lisa masio I'm the attorney at the
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate um
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
technically my title is the associate
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
child advocate and I'm here on behalf of
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
the office Kristen and I worked very
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
amendments so first is the purpose and
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
statement um
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm I'm meing on you for
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
over um so the way we drafted it isn't
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
exactly because it wasn't a replace all
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
originally but now I see it is a replace
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
all so the I I need to know one way or
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
the other the the chairman before you
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
who introduced it said it is not a
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
replace all it's he he described it as a
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
tweak to what the house voted on since
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
it says replace all I will defer to the
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
Amendments language replacing all okay
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay very good so it would be starting
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
at line 16 of your amendment that Roman
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
4 residential facilities being
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for children who cannot
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
safely receive clinically appropriate
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
care so we did tweak some of the
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
language from the oca's point of view a
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the language tweaks are just to
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
create more trauma informed language and
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
be more inclusive for the types of um
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
issues that the kids in care have we
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
also added in some of the was adding
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
back in um language that was in a
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
different amendment that didn't quite
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
make it through it was just some of it
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
was really just copy and paste issues so
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
one of the big things getting added back
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
in was this line at it will be your line
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
18 that a shortage or lack of foster
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
family homes or community- based
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
resources shall not be an acceptable
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
reason for placement in a residential
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
facility that was really the big thing
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
that got added back in the rest of the
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
statement and purpose of findings is
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
identical to amendment 0427 that was
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
ago do you want me to keep going okay
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um so then the second part of the
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill which starts on
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
your page two line six you'll notice um
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
page two lines 12 to 13 there was a
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
strike out in the bill as a adopted that
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
oh I'm lying that is still struck out
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
but the word qualified is stricken at
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning of that paragraph So as
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
Christa mentioned um they went through
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and struck
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
qualified residential placements
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
um section three of the bill starting on
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
18 in um sort of the copying and pasting
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
amendments in children and family law a
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
couple of sections were left out of the
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
in nope it does not I am kidding sorry
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing this amendment for the first
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
time as well uh so oversight cordor plac
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
so this language just changes a little
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
bit it's not really a substantive change
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
Section 3 Lines 20 to 33 it was really
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
um just the
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
wording of that section about this is
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
what a dcyf or Juvenile Justice um case
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
worker who currently is already required
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
to make monthly visits to children on
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
their case load and I think in Two Bills
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
ago you heard what those case loads were
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
those monthly visits are already
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
required under statute and are already
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
in fact occurring um this just sort of
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
of fleshes out the information gathered
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
during those visits and then adds back
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
in a lost paragraph paragraph Roman two
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
of that section which is your lines 34
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
to 36 that there will be a new form
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
created um for those visits with the
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS in the office of child advocate
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
working together just to make sure that
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
visits are happening um
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
consistently you you you you said that
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh the sections 20 through 33
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
three we're basically cleaning up some
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
wording that's already in current
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
statute as though the obligations under
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
that section are already in
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
law or is this is a cleanup or adding
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
new requirements this amendment is
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
cleaning up language from the prior
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment it is creating a new section
 
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.669 align:start position:0%
Amendment it is creating a new section
in

01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
169f okay the policy is already in place
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
this is already happening DCF workers
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
already visit kids every single month
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
this is just sort of explaining in
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
statute versus in policy or
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule what those visits
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
entail so we worked together to make
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
sure it was within the purview of what a
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
social worker could do and make sure
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
that the language would make sense to be
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
able to implement with the workers all
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
right I'll let you continue U I'll ask
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
you later about if it's already
 
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
happening in policy what is the benefit
 
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
of having it in law but but we don't
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer that now let's just keep going I
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
had a whole intro Spiel to start to
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
start representative hole do you have a
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
question I do because right now I think
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
all she's trying to do is introduce the
 
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.669 align:start position:0%
all she's trying to do is introduce the
major

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
changes so if I'm reading thisly use the
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
mic if I'm reading this correctly right
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
on page three section
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
four I know is now section three and I
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened to section
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
three that was why I was also confused
 
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
it looks like section three
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
became underneath that starting at line
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
37 on page two that was also my
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
confusion it just got swapped around
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
somehow okay so it looks like original
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
section three became well no section
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
part of section section four is this
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
original yes so original section four is
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
now part of section three and original
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
section three is tacked on at the end of
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
that new piece correct I think so as a
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable conclusion there that we
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
really ought not to pass this amendment
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
as is because it needs some cleanup no
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's correct they just I think when OS
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
took it they just swapped two sections
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
around everything's in here it just
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
isn't in the order that we put it in
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
there is one item okay maybe there's
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
something it feels like we need a clean
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that has all the sequencing
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
right well we just re so what I had
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
submitted to uh chairman Pearson was you
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
know break down change this section
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
takes change this section what we
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
received here is a replace all so we
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to go through to make
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
sure everything has has been changed and
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes OSS likes to do the numbering
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
their own way instead
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
of okay so I'll I'll just leave you with
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
the basic request then since this is so
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
new this document and it really needs to
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
be right would you just please make sure
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
you go through what OSS produced and if
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
there's any sort of modification to make
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the OS version is is precise
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
and correct see if you can get those
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
changes done and maybe a new amendment
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
number issued by Monday afternoon
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you we can do that so
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead represent I would go a step
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
further and that new amendment number
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
also have a compare back to the bill as
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
passed by the house the first time
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
that okay so this complicates the task
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
we just gave Mr Ripple we asked him to
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
do a side by side of these two
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
amendments um and now there might be
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
another just clean up I think we can I
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to consider a new
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that is cleaned up that's the
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
one we need the side by side we don't
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
need it through all the iterations along
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
the way we just need the bill as passed
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
by the house and this new amendment that
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to see on Monday okay that
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me so don't jump on this
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
immediately until we get the Department
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
to say that they think the OS version is
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay and and if it helps the
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
version we worked on drafting that has
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
sort of the just this is what's
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
changing might be
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to to Mr Ripple it will be but
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislator you can't help us we
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
just what we need is we need a clean
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill to vote
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
on so representative wer do you have a
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
wer and then representative
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
f i I have an observation here as I'm
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
looking through it I I remember on the
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
first page we talked about taking out
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
the word quality
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
qualified and then I go to on the latest
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
version I have 0427 H down on line
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
26 169 F6 I see again prior to placing a
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
child in qualified Residential Treatment
 
01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
should that word be in there or should
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
that again be removed so 0427 H is what
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
was passed by the house on the floor the
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
new Amendment will strike qualified from
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.669 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank
you

01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
Ripple so is there any progress yet
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
towards the fiscal note for the bill as
 
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
amended in the house I believe the
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
Department's been working on that um I
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
expect something within the next few
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
days so we will have that available I
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate by Monday and are they then
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to try to tie that in with this or
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
is this not expected to make
 
01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
any I'm not sure about that
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
I I think the fiscal know is pretty
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
critical to the decision
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
making so what I'd like to be able to do
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
is get back to the crosswalk of of of
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
the bill because we stopped you halfway
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
through but representative McGuire do do
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question you want to ask here
 
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
well sort of because we have to we have
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
our own stuff that we have to get back
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
to um I'd like to jump ahead if possible
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the section that concerns division
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
one the Judiciary costs which is on the
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
amendment page five line 10 I
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
believe right section
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
three uh Roman
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
3 so in this section it says that the
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
judge will review the pl this is line 17
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
judge will can review the placement
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
every 30 days I I'm I'm not tracking
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
with you could you I'm on the amendment
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
the amend page five page
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
five um sections three Roman three
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
starts on line 10 ends on line 17 okay
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay and on line 17 there's the number
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
30 days and when I read the fiscal note
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
it said that currently they the judge
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
reviews this every 90 days and we
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
effectively have one judge one full-time
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
judge equivalent does this process so
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
therefore if you're going to make 90
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
days into 30 days you need three judges
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
right and so three a judge is a million
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
doll plus thing because each one comes
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
with several Clerks etc etc so my
 
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
with several Clerks etc etc so my
question

01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
is um is it really NE if the social
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
worker is visiting the child once a
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
month why does the judge have to be
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
involved so often right I mean couldn't
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
if the the how does the judge know more
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
somehow than the social worker couldn't
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
the if if the HHS social worker
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
discovers a problem they tell the judge
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
the judge gets involved right but but
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
enough as
 
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so we would say
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
no um I didn't get to do my Preamble
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
here so the bledo uh report which we
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
have copies of here although only for
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
one Division I didn't realize we were
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
having joint division um the the issues
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
that representative Pearson alluded to
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of his testimony the
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
offic of child advocate is tasked with
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of um State Child serving
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
agencies including dcyf Juvenile Justice
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
and their contracted providers including
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
residential placements one of um an
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
important part of our job is visiting
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
children in residential placements both
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as well as um out
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
of state we visited uh two children that
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
were placed in Tennessee which was
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
um certified by the state of New
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and being paid as a level
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
three therapeutic treatment facility
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
when the child advocate and one of our
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
assistant child Advocates arrived they
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
found what looked like a Detention
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
Center children in prison style
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
jumpsuits barbed wire cameras children
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
sleeping on the floor eating on the
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
floor we immediately called uh dcyf to
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
bring this to their attention that the
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire was placing
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
children and paying for children to be
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
receiving a level of care when in fact
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
they were essentially being incarcerated
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
down there those children were returned
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
within a couple of months um and these
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
conversations started so that's really
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the beginning of this bill and the
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
work that we've been doing with DHHS as
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
well as some of the providers since that
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
time there's many pieces to that
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
oversight in this bill one piece is the
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
oversight by the actual case workers
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
which was the piece we were just
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
discussing a moment ago they already do
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
monthly visits the concern is seven
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
different workers saw these children
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
seven months in a row nobody raised a
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
red flag about barbed wire and prison
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
and jumpsuits concerning which is why we
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
felt it needed to then be in statute if
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
the current certification rules if the
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
current process if the current visits
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
weren't working which we would consider
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
that to be a not working it needed to be
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
in statute so that was that that 169 F
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
piece we just spoke about another large
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
piece though that we heard from the
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
Judiciary because part of our oversight
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
is we have contact with the division
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
with attorneys with the courts the court
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
reflected to our office that they
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
weren't getting enough information they
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
make the order placing the child based
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
on the worker's recommendations
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
typically based on what's available and
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
the level of need which is based on a a
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
cat assessment level three level four
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
level five so the courts were telling us
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
we are proceeding with just what they
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
give us that you know this kid needs to
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
be in a level three the bed we found is
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
down in Tennessee it's a certified
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
facility go so this judicial oversight
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
piece is an important part of the puzzle
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
because again we have different branches
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing different things so this really
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
builds out that oversight right now it
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
is every 90 days for children in CP care
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
this section if you look above though at
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
at lines
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
um 13 to 14 it would be every 60 days
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
the 30 days only comes into play If the
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
child or a representative of the child
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that placement but
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
children should only be in residential
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities for limited periods
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
of time for only specific treatment
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
reasons unfortunately children languish
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
in residential care when they should be
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
being brought back to their communities
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
so that Court oversight piece was a very
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
important part to increase the level of
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
Touches at the court system who felt
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
like they weren't sort of having enough
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
information to review more frequently so
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
we don't believe 90 days is sufficient
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
particularly for these children in
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
residential care um I can tell you as of
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
the end of January um the data that the
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
OCA has which doesn't include a handful
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
of bcbh kids there's
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
122 Child Protection placements so
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's through dcyf Child Protection in
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
group homes or residential care at this
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
juncture um or at that juncture so a
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
little over a month ago 241 of those
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
kids are right in New Hampshire 54 were
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
in New England not New Hampshire only
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
two were outside of New England so are
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
are you still answering the question
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
posed by representative McGuire of why
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
30 days make sense in instead of a
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
longer period of time for judicial
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
review it's a very limited number of
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
children that may require 30 days and
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
really 60 days would be the standard
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
there it'd be even rarer for it to be 30
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
days follow up so you're basically
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
saying the judiciar fiscal note is not
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
correct I guess yeah I have not seen the
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
judiciary's FIS schal note I have not
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
really had an opportunity to talk to
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
them this would increase um this would
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
increase judicial oversight you it would
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
have more hearo so this this is a good
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
segue uh the chairman of division one
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
whispered in my ear that he doesn't
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
think you all can really engage us until
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
the the correct fiscal note comes out
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not out now uh so he he rep
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative hold before do you is
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
your question relevant to division one
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a question of process
 
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
right if the office of the child
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
advocate notes an issue or the parents
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
note an issue would not a better
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
response be that the judicial branch has
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
to respond within a certain period of
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
time as opposed to a periodic reporting
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
for all cases so if if there's an issue
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's flagged either by the parents or
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the guardians or flagged by the
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
OCA that then triggers the Jud IAL
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
Branch to do something within a 30 or
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
60-day window as opposed to every case
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
going through the 30 or 60 day window
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference in workload
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
between those two I appreciate your
 
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
question because that is an important
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
clarification so first of all the OCA is
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
not a party to these cases so they we
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
would not be an office that would bring
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
it up it absolutely could be the child's
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
parent Guardian Casa attorney in cases
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
this particular section only applies to
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
children in residential treatment
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
facilities not kids in fost care not
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
kids in relative or kinship placements
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
which is why I brought up that 122
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
children so out of the almost 1,200 kids
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
in care only 122 of them could this
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
possibly apply to do you have a followup
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
I do I guess the this question still
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
holds which is a if there is an issue
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
brought up by whoever is visiting the
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
treatment facility or the respective
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
Guardians and parents of the child
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
either one of those could trigger an
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
event to go back through the cour court
 
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
for additional changes to the court
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
orders but having something that is a
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
periodic review for every child of that
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
1202 adds additional costs where there
 
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
it may not be necessary it assumes the
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
the process is broken for all 122 if you
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
force the judicial branch to review it
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
every two months if you set it up as a
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
triggering mechanism that the court gets
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
involved at the request that might
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
further reduce the workload and the
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
costs should
 
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
so not that we're done but division one
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
needs to go do division one work um we
 
01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll invi invite you all back uh
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
on Monday because I don't think we're
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
going to be at all done today we're
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
still just sort of exploring this but
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
but just to tell you my reaction so far
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
is is that the people who really care
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
and have been doing this have built a
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
methodology that assumes um 100%
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
inspection for all kids frequently and
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
and that a lot of money goes into that
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that the judicial system is likewise
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
obligated to have the operational
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to do this on a on an on an on
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis and I'm wondering if
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a first step since as I
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
understand it blood so was a really bad
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
example of something that happened once
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
that that I'm concerned that we may be
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh doing a little bit of Overkill that
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
that that the method that we should be
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking at is uh do a good contract
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
because we're not doing contracts now
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
that obligates the recipient to to do
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
the right thing uh send somebody down
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
periodically to go audit the contract
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
and the execution of the contract uh
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a problem have an
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
escalation mechanism so so that uh we
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
can react relatively quickly I it just
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
feels to me that an audit and escalation
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
methodology would would be nearly as
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
effective if not equally effective and
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
would cost a
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
tremendously less amount of money with
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
less commitment to ongoing Manpower
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of my theory do do
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
you have a just a quick response if you
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
guys considered an audit and escalate
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
methodology and rejected it for some
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
reason well we at the department
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually specifically ask that we not
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
have Contracting involved because of the
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy Contracting process and also it
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any additional teeth
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
that a our certification process already
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
contains so on a good day a contract
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
sole source push through takes over 120
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
days while these children are
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
languishing trying to get into treatment
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
facilities so we want to get them in
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
there as fast as possible certification
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
allows for that flexibility
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
so does the certification provide enough
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
detail around the obligations of the
 
01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.629 align:start position:0%
detail around the obligations of the
receiving

01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
institution that they will take good
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
care of our kids and is it auditable is
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
the certification auditable so so we may
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
not even need a new contract requirement
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
if we're doing this an effective
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
certification as long as something can
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
be audited and spot inspected correct
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
our staff has the ability to go out in
 
01:41:20.239 --> 01:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
our staff has the ability to go out in
in

01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
reinvestigate I guess or recertify um if
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
they see a see an issue I refer I defer
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
off to Rebecca because she's her team is
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
the one that does the certification
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
process okay so I'm going to listen to
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
you but I I my main question here is was
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
this alternative methodology of audit
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
and spot check and escalate uh
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
considered relative to
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
operationalizing the ongoing uh
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
proactive um inspections I believe that
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bulk of this bill sir is exactly
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
what you're describing other than the
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
fact that Contracting did get
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
removed I we jumped right to the court
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
oversight piece but frankly all of the
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
the other pieces really are a sort of
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
intensified audit system just as you
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
described initially with touch points
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
for enforceability that don't currently
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
exist or are not currently being
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
utilized under the administrative rules
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
so so we can talk more about this after
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
this hearing and and and on Monday but
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
the the distinction to me between an
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
audit and what I'm understanding from
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is an audit is relied relies
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
heavily on
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
sampling and and this doesn't feel like
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's sampling this feels like it's a
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
all-in approach and I I think I that's
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
the distinction I'm making when I use
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
the word auditing so um did you did you
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
want to make us smarter go ahead yes I
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
think I can help clarify that the bill
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
includes two components one is the child
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
specific visits that each individual
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
case worker is seeing their own youth to
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
build that connection and support that
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
youth in care every single month that is
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
one part of the visits the other are the
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
certification team visits every other
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
year we certify these providers for
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
payment based on their quality standards
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
that includes a sampling of Records
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
interviews of Staff in that audit
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
procedure every other year this not a
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
certification year we do technical
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
assistance we go onsite we do a similar
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
procedure but not for issuing the the
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
certification but providing technical
 
01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
assistance and ensuring they're meeting
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
our standards and requirements those
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are due for update
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
and we certainly intend to make them
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
more robust and consistent with the
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that have occurred
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
over time but it really truly is an
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
audit and quality assurance process when
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
our team goes out for example we have
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
two staff down in Connecticut today at a
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
facility that serving seven New
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth some voluntary and some
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
through court ordered placements and
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
they're meeting with kids they're
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
meeting with staff and going through
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
records and doing that audit
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
process if if does the committee have
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions does the department
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
have anything else to say before I close
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
this out and say I'm looking forward to
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
seeing more detail on Monday
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Earth yes I have a quick
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
question uh and proba they may not be
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
quick but I have a question um so sounds
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
that this whole thing is driven
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
by somehow we put a couple one or more
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
children into a prison and this seems
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
like gross Overkill to determine that
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
place so if I could add to that
 
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
it did the blood Soo incident happened
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
because we did not provide profic
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
adequate um guidance
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
or or just did they blow it did they
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
they just fail to deliver what they said
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
they would do wa who who what broke here
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
them or
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
us that was before my time I really
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for you um but I
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
can find out more information as to
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
where that that happened in the
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
chain that' be very useful information
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
don't you given that we're basically
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
putting in place this huge process of
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
following every child every couple of
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
months for something that sounds like
 
01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
was a disastrous
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
mistake we have a report to answer your
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
F just a couple of sentences would be
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
helpful how do we want how do they want
 
01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
prison so the office of child advocate
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
um in part of our oversight does these
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
visits I would say well this was one
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
incident that we caught in the
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
conversations that occurred
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
afterwards there were larger concerns
 
01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
that this might not be isolated because
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
the way the system was set up the visits
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
that attorney Ross was talking about we
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
found out never happened at bledo they
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
certified bledo when a full year and
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
recertified bled Soo without ever
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
in-person visiting that facility to
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
conduct the
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
required certification under the
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we found out during
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
those convers ations that a lot of
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
facilities had not had the required
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
number or depth of in-person visit that
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
before placing children there so that's
 
01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.109 align:start position:0%
before placing children there so that's
one

01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
issue fair enough so this sounds a very
 
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.310 align:start position:0%
issue fair enough so this sounds a very
simple

01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
solution before you place somebody in a
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
facility you go and visit it and you
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
determine it's a prison or not or it's
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
even better than that I mean this
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like you need to do
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
follow-ups on an ongoing basis when
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
you're saying if I heard you correctly
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
nobody went down to this facility to see
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
hey this is a prison I mean I think I
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
could detect a prison and it sounds like
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
you made it pretty easy to
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
detect and unfortunately seven different
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
case workers from DCF visited that
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
facility in the seven months preceding
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
oca's visit and not a single red flag
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
was rais and I I not sure that there was
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
a drastic change in the month prior but
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is feeling like we need to
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
shut this down for today not that we're
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
done but that I'm just wondering if um
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
we should do what's your experience with
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing subcommittees on something like
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
um o o okay so um so so let's let's go
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
ahead and and and go ahead and keep the
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
Monday after afternoon date um but um
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
let's talk about a subcommittee because
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
it just feels to me like there's just so
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
much going on here and so many questions
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
to ask that will significantly
 
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
significantly alter the financial impact
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill um that we should we should
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
really get somebody to from our
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
committee to bury burrow into it okay so
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
so who in division three representative
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
Murray I know you're a guest um um but
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
who on division 3 would like to dig into
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
this deeper and be on a subcommittee I I
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
think I would like to be just just
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
because I think there's a a systems
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
thing here and I I have a systems
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
background so well I might like to be
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm going to be gone from
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
Friday until next Wednesday yes sir
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
don't rub it
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
in representative Stringham and
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney I don't want to
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
put everyone on the spot representative
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
priest do you want to are you ready to
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
dig into something new Jump in you seem
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
to have the background where you where
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
you could help us figure this out I'll
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
to so so we have two people on the
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee unless you're you're going
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
on vacation as well aren't you do are
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
are you personally interested in
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
this okay so so the subcommittee will be
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
me representative walner representative
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%

more minutes of questions and and stuff
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
to ask about 1598 this is uh relative to
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%

about whether or not you need any it
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
changes to manage all the shuffling that
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
you guys think you

uh Nathan white CFO agj
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
just did you have a question to start us
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
off representative walner yes I do and I
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
I talked with um John and Nathan
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
actually about this bill so when I
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
drafted the
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill the real thought behind the bill
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
was children who come into the system
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
already being eligible for Social
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
Security Disability or a death benefit
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
died the intent and that was this is my
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
fault I'll take the blame for it I
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
modeled it after Arizona and the intent
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
was not to go really it was to address
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
those children who already were eligible
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
and who came to the system with this
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
benefit not to go out and try to find
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
find out if everyone else
 
01:52:23.599 --> 01:52:25.149 align:start position:0%
find out if everyone else
was

01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
eligible if we took out that
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
part where everyone else is eligible one
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
is this still Le I mean would it be
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
legal to take it out are we causing
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves some sort of legal problem
 
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
about that or would that be a way of
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
looking at reducing a lot of the
 
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:51.430 align:start position:0%
looking at reducing a lot of the
cost

01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.990 align:start position:0%
cost
so

01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's an excellent
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
question and I think it would depend
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
upon what the language change would look
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
like as far as the impact on the
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
Staffing need I I would still anticipate
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
the same sort of general fund impact
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
loss right um that that would still be
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
there but I would assume there'd likely
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
be some impact on the Staffing component
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
but I think we' we'd probably want to
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
work on some language and then run it
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
past the fiscal Specialists and and and
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
the experts on this to get a better
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
understanding I don't know if you want
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
to yes I
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
think I think that would be that would
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
lessen because in terms of legal support
 
01:53:35.069 --> 01:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
you would not have that eligibility
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
right uh you would have wouldn't have
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
those hearings those initial hearings
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
that you have for a possible denial of
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
benefits for example uh it would still
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
leave like we talked about we would
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
still need some legal Staffing to
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the fidu AR duty of of the
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
safeguarding yes but a lot of the a lot
 
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the cost it looked like a lot of the
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
um cost of additional staff really came
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
around that eligibility going through
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility for every child that came
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
into the system and I think Nathan said
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
like probably isn't 6,000 a year but
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty pretty large number I've
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
had a question from the beginning that
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
I've never really been able to get a
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
good answer to and I surprised that we
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't just have this on the top of our
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
heads how many children actually have
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
come into the system in the last year
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
let's say take the last year how many
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
came in who were already eligible and
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
who we then kept their Social Security
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
payment so I I think I would I would ask
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
your meaning of eligible because when I
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
hear as as someone who's practiced
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
Social Security I hear eligible anyone
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
could be eligible until we ask Social
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
Security uh you know that that so I just
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm understanding
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
anyone who actually anyone who actually
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
receives it and gets gets a payment a
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
regular payment so someone has been who
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
has been determined already eligible by
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security as disabled or as able
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
to receive payments
 
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:20.669 align:start position:0%
to receive payments
okay

01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
we could certainly look into that and
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that figure we don't
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
have it on the top of our heads so I
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
mean because we we're we're withholding
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
These funds every month from these some
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
way that money is being transferred from
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
Social Security to the
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
department yes so so we we can I mean we
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
can look at every account for every
 
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
child and then those funds are used to
 
01:55:48.069 --> 01:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
offset the the uh service cost and the
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
service or treatment cost typically
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
exceed um the amount that we're getting
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
there right so there's probably some
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism that we could look
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
at but I think um as far as cap we just
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
have to pick a point in time because
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to move every day but but we
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
we can go back and get you an estimate
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you I think that would be
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
really helpful so we had some so we knew
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
what sort of what the scope of it is how
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
many children at any one time might
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
actually fall into this category that's
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
correct and I think also knowing how
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
many go in and out because I also think
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
that something unique to this is when
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about creating a trust for
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
example we could have a kid come in we
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
create a trust they leave and then we
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
have a new kid come in just just to
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
remind the committee it's not going to
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
be a stagnant number when we say we have
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
400 kids that doesn't mean we'll well
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
well okay we'll make 400 trust that
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
could mean we make 600 trusts just
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
because we have that in andout
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
constantly thank
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
you represent Mooney thank you very much
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here I was
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
introduced recently to these two
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
beautifully written policies uh at
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I guess I'm trying to justify
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
they're so nicely done you've got FSU
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
managing it you've got a representative
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
paye you've got these accounts all
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
listed and everything why something like
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
this just can't be inserted into that
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
and uh part of the purview of what's
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
already going on as opposed to um
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
massive dollars to manage what seems to
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
be um not exactly enough money to
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
justify that could you describe or
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
explain that um why that just can't be
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
place uh chairman in response to
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
represent Mon's question uh the
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
department does have a policy and I
 
01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
believe the policy we're referring to is
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
dated December of
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
2022 and as part of the policy the
 
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
universe that we're talking about and I
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
think it's very much in line perhaps
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
with what uh represent walner was
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
referring to of a smaller scope of
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that we' serve we do
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
currently have the policy as it relates
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
to children who are either disabled
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
children whose parents are disabled or
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
the third Co category is parents who are
 
01:58:12.069 --> 01:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
deceased and so we we do currently do
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
that but we still our response to the
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is that the bill at least
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
is currently drafted even with a scaled
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
down version would require some level of
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
resources by the department and
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
certainly we're engaged to working with
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
you the sponsor and the committee on
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
that as Mr White had said uh but that's
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
the the response right now it's a much
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
smaller Universe of individuals that
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're currently identifying um through
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
that process and I'll stop and see if
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
tney young would like to save
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
agree do you have a followup are there
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions I got I got two
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
really quick kind of yes no ones yes no
 
01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.310 align:start position:0%
really quick kind of yes no ones yes no
Mr

01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
Williams and then maybe a third longer
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
one the first one is I'm not seeing any
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
it systems in here any money for itss so
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm assuming that with all the
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
accounts and the need to be able to
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
provide access to the account to the
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
individual the individuals um not
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
dependents the other way around um
 
01:59:21.149 --> 01:59:21.159 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh Prov monthly statements
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
provide uh Financial auditing
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
segregation of Duties all of that stuff
 
01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
that that that we probably have some
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
process and it support that needs to be
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal note am am I
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
mistaken I know that's correct most
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
organizational representative payes that
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
do this type of work especially in our
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
state do have case management systems
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
that help that
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
tracking helping the tracking is is kind
 
01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:50.679 align:start position:0%
kind of distinct because I'm thinking
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
like my bank account I I have a bank
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
account and and and this feels like it's
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
creating the equivalent of a bank
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
account for a kid so that when they are
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
out of the system they get whatever the
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
that balance is so it's it's really got
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be audible it's got to make sure that
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
we got fraud protection we gota you know
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
all that stuff do we need additional
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
processes additional it no no no the the
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
the systems are sufficient today to to
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
handle this but it's the legal
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
complexities in the additional workload
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
that are the
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
issue okay and then the second question
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
is I I see on the last page there's um a
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
comment about increase general fund
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure of approximately 2.1 million
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
a year and I'm looking at the table and
 
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
I should I should I be seeing that 2.1
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
million a year in this table or is it in
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
there and I'm I'm just missing it yeah
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
so um in in the in the fiscal note that
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at as introduced um
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
I I think maybe State fiscal year 26 is
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
a good year to start with so that
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
includes the $2.1 million Revenue offset
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
as well as the position expenses so
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we're coming up with the the
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
2.87 there because the 766 th000 or so
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent position Cost Plus the $2.1
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
offset okay so that that's basically the
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
2.1 million plus the 770,000 or so plus
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
positions okay precisely got it
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing I I talked
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
if Miss rosenberg's here she may have
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
thought about the answer to this but you
 
02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
all are are free to answer this um what
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about are we creating a
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
new entitlement are we setting a
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
precedent here that we need to worry
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
about um uh being applied to other
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
programs uh is this is this going to be
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
a a something unique or is this
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
something that is consistent with the
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
way things are are being
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
board are you talking about within our
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
state or are you talking about across
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
the board yes within the state uh you
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
know are do we do we set up a accounts
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
to take Federal monies we receive to
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
assign it to an individual for their
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
future personal use is is this a a new
 
02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
entitlement or is this something um that
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
is consistent with other practices
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
within the state that you know
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
of I believe this would be new in terms
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
of having uh being a
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
fiduciary as the state as a DHHS being a
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciary on half of children this would
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
be new okay so we're talking about a new
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
president um M Miss Rosenberg does that
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
cause you to want to say something it
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
does you want go ahead and use that mic
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
end I have no idea why you thought I'd
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
want to say something um I'm Karen
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center and no I mean
 
02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
the social the federal government has
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
determined some time ago that funds that
 
02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
are so federal funds like Social
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
Security disability benefits for
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
children who are disabled and SSI
 
02:03:26.589 --> 02:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
benefits are supposed to be conserved
 
02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
and used for children and they've
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
established stable accounts as a me as a
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
legal method to maintain These funds and
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
when the state is in legal custody of a
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
child they have all the same obligations
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
to act in the best interest of the child
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to follow the policies and laws of
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government which would
 
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
include conserving funds for children
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
with disabilities um and the federal
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
funds that they receive and that
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
includes using those funds for their
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
additional needs that they might have
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
during the time that they're in state
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
custody as well as conserving those
 
02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
funds if that to the extent that there
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
are any funds left to conserve so that
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
they are available to children with
 
02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities remember these kids have
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
really extraordinary needs so it's not
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
really it's a federal obligation so so
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
so two kind of quick ones one is it is
 
02:04:17.310 --> 02:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
it your position that you think we may
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
be out of compliance with fed federal
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
law I think that federal law says that
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have this obligation to conserve
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
those funds and the Social Security
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
Administration and US DHHS have been
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
encouraging states to examine these
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
policies and States across the country
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
now are starting to change these
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
policies and are not continuing to take
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
the funds so New Mexico because because
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
that changes the whole conversation if
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
we think we have a compliance with
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
federal law issue I think that the
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
federal government I I I don't know that
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
I see Mr Williams shaking his head I
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
can't tell if it's a yes or no or oh God
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
talk so this is this first occasion that
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard this issue being raised um to
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
our knowledge and I'm going to um have
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
attorney young respond to it I'm not
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
certain that we have a federal
 
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
obligation the fact that there are
 
02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
states that don't do this and there are
 
02:05:13.629 --> 02:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
states that do this particular function
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh I would we'd have to have a further
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
conversation with um with um attorney
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg but I this is the first that
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
in our conversation up to all the policy
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
hearings and up to this point that I've
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
heard anybody raise that there's like a
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
federal compliance issue not not to my
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge ask U Miss Young if she can
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
confirm we don't want to debate it here
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
no but I mean I don't think we're going
 
02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're getting audit let's
 
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
see if we can pin it down if we have an
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
out of a compliance issue that that's
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
all kind of a yes no legal opinion from
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Department um because I'd like to
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
know if we have an I'm hearing the word
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
obligation I hear legal obligation I
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
think it's an obl I think that there
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things going on there
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
is an old there is an old US Supreme
 
02:05:58.109 --> 02:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
Court case before the institution of
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
able and the stable act under which the
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court did say that states
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
could pocket this money since that time
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Administration has
 
02:06:11.229 --> 02:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
issued further guidance basically
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
stating now we have these methods of
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
conserving student kids accounts and
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
that they ought to be utilized so
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
technically I don't think that the state
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
is violating federal law but I think
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
that there is clear Federal guidance
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
that this is an appropriate use of the
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
federal benefits that children receive I
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
I don't diminish uh moral obligations or
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
social obligations I just distinguish
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
them from legal obligations is the point
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
there um and then um oh my God what was
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
the second thing I it's just right on
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
tongue oh oh okay so since this money is
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be going to help um with the
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
the care of children and we're putting
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
the money in that's Surplus each month
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
what happens in year two of this account
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
if the kid has an exceptional need does
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
the state have an an ability to access
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
that account for State expenses is or is
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
this just once it's in there it's always
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
in there and it belongs to the kid at
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
when they they're out of the pro
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
no the idea is that the funds would be
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
utilized for the child's extort needs as
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
they arise while they're in care as well
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
as um being a vehicle for them to be
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
conserved for later so they can use for
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
both purposes okay thank you go ahead it
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
would be just like any trustee uh that's
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and she's
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
talking about able and stable accounts
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
but that's modeled out of it's you know
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
a trust that has someone monitoring it
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that has a fiduciary obligation to act
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
the best interest for a need I think the
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
best example is my favorite which is a
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
Mercedes we might have a kid who they
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe their best interest is they
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
would like that Mercedes they have
 
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
enough money for it their account that
 
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the fiduciary that is
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring that account is going to get
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
them a Mercedes maybe we get them an
 
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
Ultima instead because they need to go
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
to work but we're not going to get to
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Mercedes that gives a third party
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
someone that determines that the
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
beneficiary's best interest would be to
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
use those funds so if there was an
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need and the fiduciary
 
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
assigned agreed that it was a need that
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
was appropriate and also afforded the
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
best possibility under the funds meaning
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's a need that
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
extinguish the entire account that would
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
be an extraordinary decision by the
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
trustee to use all of that versus
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
conserving it for future needs so that
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
goes into fiduciary obligations which
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
also goes into why this is complex in
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
terms of safeguarding because you get
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
those questions daily this kid wants XYZ
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
they need this they need to go to this
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
um summer camp well we have to to look
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
at that how much money is expected to
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
come in next year how much money is in
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
that account is this in the best
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
interest from a fiduciary money
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint and also for that kid and
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's what gets complicated about
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
making those decisions with the state
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
and safeguarding with those individual
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
accounts okay uh thank you I I I think
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
we've gotten as far as we need to get
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
today and we'll we'll bring come back on
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
Monday I I I don't know what you all on
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
the committee think um
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we could figure out what we want
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
to do with this on
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
Monday uh with that um I'm going to
 
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.470 align:start position:0%
Monday uh with that um I'm going to
close

02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
close
 
02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
1598 and uh I'm going to
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
open uh
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
1593 is this you representative
 
02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
Stringham okay you you can introduce it
 
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
from stay from here this works yeah that
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
works okay great uh thank you um the
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
background purpose of this bill um I
 
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
think think to go through this I'm going
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
to hand out a u
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
memorandum uh that was
 
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh distributed basically after we
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
pass so this this involves the
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
disability waiver
 
02:10:19.229 --> 02:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
program and in July of this year of 2023
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh an element that was included as part
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
of the budget uh was uh sarily removed
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
as no longer being uh an appropriate
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
service to be included under the waiver
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
program and this was in um this was done
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
in response uh to a f federal government
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh statement that said uh
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
recreational activities uh should not be
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
included uh in the um
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the in the budgets so
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
um uh so this this bill uh uh was
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
introduced in Health and Human
 
02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
Services uh and uh W with the idea of at
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
least on a temporary basis allowing
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
these services that were felt to be
 
02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
essential as part of the overall goal of
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
the disability
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
program uh could continue until uh you
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
know rather than having them
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh sarily uh uh ripped away basically
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
without notice as people's disability uh
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
waiver um budget uh was being reviewed
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
annually so um uh the bill passed in the
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the health and human services with a
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
vote of 17 to3 and on a Voice vote on
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
the floor and now comes to us with a uh
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
to to discuss uh how much this is going
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
to cost and and
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
um uh and where that should come
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
from um so as I said our banum budget
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
was built upon the developmental
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
disability waiver patients receiving the
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
same level of services they did the
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
previous bium and then inflating it for
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know for the amount of rate
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
increases that we put in that's how
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's done so what's happened is that
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
those budgets now have come through
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
they've been reviewed and element has
 
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
been taken out of it uh it's a
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
comparatively small percentage we don't
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
know exactly what percent it's probably
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
far less than 1% of the budgets have
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
been removed uh but these were monies
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
that uh under the waiver program we were
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
planning on spending uh that now is not
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh no longer viewed as appropriate for
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
us to spend uh and um you know related
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
to that the federal government would
 
02:12:49.709 --> 02:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
have paid 50% of that amount so uh you
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
know Bas basically there's some savings
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
inside the disability waiver program
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's not large enough that uh we get
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to say hey this is found
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
money let's put it somewhere else or
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's just going to
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
kind of roll through and that's what it
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
so uh if if um you know as uh HHS said
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
you know this is not a way to kind of
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
rip out these necessary services but
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can transition to
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
something the idea is to create a
 
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
special fund outside of the waiver
 
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
program that would pay for these uh
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
already you know regardless of of uh how
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
quickly we implement this or or pass it
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
um we're only we're only talking about
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
one year of eligibility for these
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
services so if you think about it that
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
way uh rather than paying 50% of these
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
services for two years we're talking
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
about about paying 100% of it for one
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
year so whatever that number is it kind
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
of is fitting into the overall spend uh
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that we
 
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.910 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that we
were

02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
expecting um logistically it's going to
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
be it would be a little bit different um
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services changed the
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
original bill that we put in to
 
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:14.599 align:start position:0%
prioritize uh you know assuming that
 
02:14:16.109 --> 02:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
they you know they run out of money in
 
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
are appropriation and enough they
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
prioritize existing developmental
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
disability budgets they put in the
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
limiting to one year let's come up with
 
02:14:27.149 --> 02:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
with something else for the program
 
02:14:30.549 --> 02:14:30.559 align:start position:0%
itself so uh the the fiscal notes uh
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
that was distributed today will show
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
show uh just an appropriation in this um
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
this bium budget so the amount in there
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
that uh is suggested now um you know no
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
recipient would be eligible for more
 
02:14:50.350 --> 02:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
than $600 of these types of services and
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
the note I handed around um you know
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
what what that shows is uh kind of what
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
we had to kind of services that were in
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
there that had to be um removed things
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
like dance lessons horseback riding
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
lessons uh things I could see you know
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
some people may feel like that are not
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the program they couldn't afford
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
themselves that's probably why these
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
types of
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
recreational uh activities uh which um
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
really allow for these recipients uh to
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
more fully uh integrate and um be part
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the social fabric of New Hampshire is
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
probably part of the reason why that's
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
in but I'm sure for each budget uh it's
 
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
um paired with meaning each individual
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
is part of the program uh that one
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
element is is an important part of the
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
overall picture so and what services are
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
available whether it's house cleaning or
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
or rides to work and so on so um um you
 
02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
know the goal then if is to be able to
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
keep those in and allow uh the state of
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the area agencies um
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
to um transition to something else uh or
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
if if the can't in these services are
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
still done figure out some way to pay
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
for this if the federal government is
 
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
not going to under the developmental
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
disability waiver program
 
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
anymore uh there's an uh note of 500,000
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
we've certainly been trying to um uh
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
kind of understand exactly how many how
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
many uh of these budgets are being
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
impacted um the the first the first
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
figure kind of came out says how you
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
know um uh how much did each area agent
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
each uh does an IND individual Area
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
Agency uh think they're they're talking
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
about Services being discontinued three
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
out of 10 came back and said you know an
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
average of 50,000 so that's 500,000 a
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
year or and um so that's 50,000 50,000
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
per area agency and there are 10 area
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
agencies so that's a half a million and
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
I imagine you know Alex can talk about
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more okay we'll bring
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
them up but okay and um so they gave us
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount they didn't give us a
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
number of of individuals that's correct
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay so and uh that that's not in um not
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
information you know it's also gone to
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh OS and that's not information that
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
our current systems that we have can can
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
kind of easily go out basically you
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
probably have to audit a series of
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
individual budgets see how many of them
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
more impacted and um you know
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
extrapolate from there which is what I
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
continue to ask uh anybody who's
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
involved in these Services if if they
 
02:18:02.349 --> 02:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
can get some uh more more intelligent
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
guess work so we know how much money to
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
ask for I do feel comfortable that
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
500,000 would be adequate anything
 
02:18:14.429 --> 02:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
that's not spent obviously is returned
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
back to the state budget um so but we
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to ask for more than than we
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
need if we don't have to as I said
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is um there is an
 
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
offsetting savings that have gone under
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
the disability waiver program that
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
happens with no
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh no effort on our part and the same
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
there any are you done yep do any
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
committee members have a question for
 
02:18:45.679 --> 02:18:46.509 align:start position:0%
committee members have a question for
the

02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:48.549 align:start position:0%
the
sponsor

02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:18:50.669 --> 02:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
yes just to
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
clarify when you said we'd be spending
 
02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
These funds
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise you meant we'd be spending
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
federal funds otherwise correct and
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
we're supplanting those with General
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
funds well if if this change hadn't
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
occurred we would have spent twice as
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
much money because we would had two
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
years and 50% of it would have been paid
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
by the federal government 50% by the
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
state government so
 
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
therefore um paying % in one year is
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent to 50% of those services and
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
um um so that's that's why I get the net
 
02:19:30.509 --> 02:19:30.519 align:start position:0%
out effect okay but this also probably
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
creates an ongoing obligation doesn't it
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh no the the bill um it's it's just
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
bium so this is a little weird because
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on this bill so so I
 
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
have some background to sort of
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
summarize what I think about this bill
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
what what what what had been happening
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
for years is that um we had some
 
02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
individuals in some area agencies who
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
had been getting U some portion of their
 
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
recreational Services uh
 
02:20:15.870 --> 02:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
covered um and as new management came
 
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
into the department and they took a look
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
at this component they they you're
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
shaking your head am I wrong okay um
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
they they came to the conclusion that we
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
were uh maybe out of sync with what the
 
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh CMS had authorized and and that we
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
had been we had created a habit in some
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
cases of paying out wck services that
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
where we didn't really have direct full
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
authority to do so and so it's been very
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
painful to that Community to withdraw
 
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
what they had gotten used to and it was
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
very difficult to get them to understand
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we're we're really just trying to
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
protect the program by coming into
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
compliance with the CMS regulations and
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
as a result they they are no longer able
 
02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
to get what they had gotten used to and
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
so I think what this bill is an attempt
 
02:21:17.710 --> 02:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
to do is to um find a way to allow that
 
02:21:20.349 --> 02:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
part of the population to continue to
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
receive support on recreational Services
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
is is that is that a fair summary since
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor yeah although um you know the
 
02:21:33.389 --> 02:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh presentations by people
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
who are seeing their budgets impacted um
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
they uh you know while it could be
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted that these are recreational
 
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
Services they thought it was part of the
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
Mandate of the program to provide
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
socially inte
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm relying on the opinion of
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
the uh people we hire to execute the
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
program not the people who are
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
recipients in the public because
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody has to interpret and and that's
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
an employee right yeah I but you know I
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
I I I I do think there's a difference
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
um whether a
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
service you know looking at it from 10
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
from a th000 feet looks like a
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
recreational service that says hey how
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
come you're buying horseback riding
 
02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
lessons for for somebody I can't afford
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
horseback writing lessons for my kids
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm not in the disability waiver
 
02:22:32.349 --> 02:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
program so that some of it is is you
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
know trying to make the program looking
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
like it purely that it's meeting unusual
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
and unmet needs of a severely right uh
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
handicapped group okay so so so now I'm
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
stepping out of the sponsor role
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
and I want to ask you some pointed
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions if I may sure okay so um so
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
horseback riding was covered as long as
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
it was therapeutic it had a therapeutic
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
person and the part of this that was
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
covered was that if the kid needed to go
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
to a recreation event and they needed
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
some special skilled individual to
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
travel with them and provide support
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
that part was reimbursable what was not
 
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
was found to be not reimbursable as I
 
02:23:23.950 --> 02:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
understood it was the admission fee for
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
example to uh to an amusement park that
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
that was not uh able to be reimbursed
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
anymore that that's what I understood
 
02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
from what I observed on an area agency
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and talking to um Miss santanella
 
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
and um others in the department uh
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
represent or uh M Miss Tilly are are are
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
you you able to speak on behalf of of
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
Miss santanella is she a different
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
department oh okay I I've I've kind of
 
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
cited what I think I heard from her and
 
02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
I if I'm wrong make sure you correct me
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
later okay um and so so the the
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure what my question is
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
to you but I'll let you introduce
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
yourself and tell us what you think you
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
heard good afternoon representative
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh my name is Melissa nth I am
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
an attorney with the Department of
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh providing
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
counsel to the Bureau of Developmental
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
services so uh to the extent you would
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
like me to answer any questions um I'm
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
happy to do that but to answer the the
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
specific question you just asked
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the the there's a difference between
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic horseback riding which
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
would still if those assessed needs are
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
met would still be covered under the
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
waiver versus horseback riding for fun
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
um but you are correct in that in an
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
instance of something that might be
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
considered recreational in nature while
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
the admission might not be covered
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
because that individual still might need
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
supports to be able to engage in that
 
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
activity those staff supports would
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
still be reimbursable as uh would
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
potentially transportation to and from
 
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.630 align:start position:0%
potentially transportation to and from
those

02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
activities okay so I think you just
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
validated what I said
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes just you know if you disagree with
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
me just put a you know stick in it but
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay so
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so that makes me question the $600
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
per individual if we're talking about
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
admissions to the things that are on
 
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
page two mman Park trampoline parks
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
movie theaters that sort of thing uh how
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
did you come up or how did the um um the
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist come up with
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
$600 per person as the right number I
 
02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
you know I do not know I would leave
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
that to uh Mr kbis to see how he came up
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
with that um the department was you know
 
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
kind of it's not the department
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored bill but the department wants
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
to you know work with
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
folks okay so so whatever that number is
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
if it's $600 or 500 or 750 whatever that
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
number I I'm curious how we determine
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
that number and then it's that's got to
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
be 600 times X we need to know some
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
number of humans that would um take
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of this um I I know it's a
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
first pro year program we don't have all
 
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
the data but it would be nice to have an
 
02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.550 align:start position:0%
the data but it would be nice to have an
approximate

02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
approximate
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
x uh I appreciate the question the
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
challenge is that many times these
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
Services were rolled into someone's
 
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
overall budget so they weren't a
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
specific line item in the budget
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying this is paying for
 
02:26:51.389 --> 02:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
something that is recreational so the
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
department actually does not have a read
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
on that that would need to come from the
 
02:27:00.269 --> 02:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
area agencies uh doing a deep dive into
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
the budgets for individuals to see what
 
02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
had rolled up into the overall request
 
02:27:06.429 --> 02:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
they had submitted to the
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
department sure that would be the formal
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
way to get the most precise number
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
possible but for to get an approximate I
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
think there are less than a 100 case
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
managers and this field in New Hampshire
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
why not just call 10 of them that are
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Smart Ones and say hey in your
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
experience what what what what numbers
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
are we talking about and I I don't know
 
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
if they would be able to to give that
 
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
number to us either to be quite honest
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
with you I don't know if there's really
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
anyone that has even a ballpark
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
estimation yeah the anxiety around this
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
issue is so intense I'm sure somebody
 
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
has a a gut feeling how many uh Mr K
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
Special K okay did you you want to grabb
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
that microphone at the end and just
 
02:27:57.269 --> 02:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.710 --> 02:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
something thank you Mr chairman Alex
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
kbis I represent the 10 area agencies I
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
actually met with them yesterday morning
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I told them about this subcommittee
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
and I said that that question will
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
probably come up how many people are we
 
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
probably come up how many people are we
talking

02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
about I did press them as hard as I
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
could and I believe a rough estimate is
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
probably less than 2,000 people don't
 
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
quote me on that and I will try to get a
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
deeper dive but a rough back of the
 
02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
napkin calculation is probably in the
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 1500 to 2,000
 
02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
individuals let's say 2,000 did you did
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
you get a sense on whether $600 was a
 
02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:34.750 align:start position:0%
you get a sense on whether $600 was a
good

02:28:34.750 --> 02:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
number 600 I don't want to contradict
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
what Melissa said but I believe the
 
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
apartment had proposed a $500 limit and
 
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
I had requested that that be increased
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
to 600 $0000 so somebody do the math is
 
02:28:49.319 --> 02:28:51.150 align:start position:0%
to 600 $0000 so somebody do the math is
that

02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
$120,000 it's a mill if if everybody
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
milon of course that's the maximum per
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
beneficiary so if all 1500 use the
 
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
maximum that's $900,000
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay so or if it's 2,000 it's 1.2
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
million if they use half of it on
 
02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:11.070 align:start position:0%
million if they use half of it on
average

02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
then thank you for that I wanted to do a
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
sanity check on the half a million go go
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
ahead I I think one really important
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
point if we're doing back of the
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
envelope math is you also have to factor
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
in um right now the way that this is
 
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
written is that we would contract this
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
out and we would expect there to be some
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
overhead fee um so I think it's really
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
important just to consider that when
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're when we're
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
estimating can I respond I I saw today
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that the Department's
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
saying that it's
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
12% um I mean to me that should be
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated and I I would I would commit
 
02:29:45.389 --> 02:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
that the air agencies could do it for
 
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
less than 12% I don't know where that
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
number came from but um the intention
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
here is not to create overhead for the
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
AA agencies the the intention is to fill
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
the Gap that that's been created so if
 
02:29:59.550 --> 02:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to look at
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
reducing that 12% estimate in the bill I
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
would have no problem with with half of
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
that or maybe even less right all right
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
just just work on that we'll come back
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
on Monday and see what your the new
 
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
thinking is um and the reason I'm
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
hitting it so specifically here is
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it took a really long time to
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
get this fiscal note and so I really
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to dig into
 
02:30:25.950 --> 02:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.309 --> 02:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
um I have a different question it's a
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's a question of fundamental fairness
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to pay say an
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
admission fee for a kid on in the DD
 
02:30:41.950 --> 02:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
program to go to say a water
 
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
park what is the fairness issue for a
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
tax pay paying family that is not a
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of any government programs
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
why they need to pay for their kid to go
 
02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
to the very same amusement park there's
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental fairness issue
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
here does and it's a philosophical one
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to take a shot at
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
addressing are we being fair to our
 
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers families with this
 
02:31:13.150 --> 02:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
program I'm go ahead well I would say to
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
that that we're not only talking about
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
children here but we're talking about
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
about adults this is not a Children's
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
Program uh you know think of think of a
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
person who may be 40 40 years old who
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
lives in a staffed residence gets Social
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
Security okay you're too much the
 
02:31:36.269 --> 02:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness question what why
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
is this fair to a taxpayer family that
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
they don't get this same
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity because these are
 
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who through no fault of
 
02:31:49.269 --> 02:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
their own have limited ability to earn
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
income and are on programs like Social
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
Security that most of that funding goes
 
02:31:55.870 --> 02:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
to their room and board and their
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
shelter they get to keep $75 a month for
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
toothpaste and incidentals and they
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability that others do
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
again through no fault of their own
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
because of the condition that they were
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
born with that if they want to go to
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
karate twice a
 
02:32:14.110 --> 02:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
month and their parents have been paying
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
for them for for years they're adult
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
is it reasonable for the state to say
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
look let's let's get them out into the
 
02:32:23.550 --> 02:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
community a couple of times a month and
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
and their interest as an instrument or
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
karate or horses could we have a very
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
limited benefit for a small number of
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
needy people who again through no fault
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
of their own and because of their
 
02:32:36.309 --> 02:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
disability and their conditions have a
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
limited ability to earn income to have
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
recreation in their life so that is the
 
02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
intention of this is to try to fill that
 
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
Gap I I think that's a good answer thank
 
02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
wner so Alex
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so many disability people with um
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities are very
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
isolated and a lot of these look like
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
activities that are
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
really here to help them socialize and
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
have some sort of a
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
normal social experience which they
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise might not have and which The
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
General population does have at their
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
their their abilities are are able to do
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
that but these are often I mean just
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
because you go bowling isn't necessarily
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to be the greatest
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
bowler in the world but it might be that
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
you're meeting up with some people who
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
you talk to have a you know have a meal
 
02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
with and have some socialization EXA
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
exactly are there any other questions Cu
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh or any comments uh because I'm
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
getting ready to stop this go ahead Mr
 
02:33:49.469 --> 02:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
White I'd just like to point out a few
 
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
technical issues um that the committee
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
should consider on page one of the bill
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh row 12 um the appropriation is made
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
for the state fiscal year ending June
 
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.269 align:start position:0%
for the state fiscal year ending June
30th

02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
30th
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
2024 um the effective date is upon
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
passage so if the bill passes after July
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
we would be into State fiscal year
 
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
25 um the second uh consideration as
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
well is currently line 15 beginning on
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
line 14 any unexpended fund she laps to
 
02:34:21.710 --> 02:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
the general fund on July 1
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
2025 that would mean that the funds
 
02:34:26.349 --> 02:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
would lapse in the next bium normally
 
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
you would see the funds lapse within
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
this bium so that should be June 30th
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
2025 if that's the intent otherwise
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
you'd just be balancing the next budget
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
with whatever laps came from
 
02:34:40.349 --> 02:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
here would would it be cleaner if we
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
just had this program start up at the
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
with a fresh
 
02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.830 align:start position:0%
with a fresh
budget

02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's a question yeah fresh budget
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
year you don't want to answer that
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how I would Define
 
02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
cleaner could I answer it okay do you
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a question represented stream no I
 
02:35:07.469 --> 02:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
thought you did all right do you have
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay can I answer real real quick the
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
reason that we didn't wait for the next
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
banum is because as representative
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
Stringham said these Services have
 
02:35:19.469 --> 02:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
already been offline for a year if we
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
wait till to start it up again in July
 
02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
of next year you could be another year
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
out so it would be two years so that's
 
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
why we wanted to at least try to get
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
something temporary in place before the
 
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
next panium we thought this was a mod so
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
represent Stringham told you
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
that we discussed it okay good all right
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
um if there are no other questions I'm
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and close um
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
1593 uh and open open uh HB
 
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
1669 and I'll note that we're 35 minutes
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
behind but I think we can um start to
 
02:36:00.670 --> 02:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
gain some steam here uh who's
 
02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:02.190 align:start position:0%
gain some steam here uh who's
introducing

02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
1669 oh I haven't seen you all day
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Mr chairman I actually
 
02:36:10.750 --> 02:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know that you were meeting on
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
this until I had a good conversation in
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the hall it's been a busy day in Health
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
and Human Services uh I'm here to
 
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 1669 I'm the prime
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor this is a bill that would ensure
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
that when the department if if the
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
department chooses to share the
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
information in the New Hampshire
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
immunization information system with any
 
02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
other parties that before they do so
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
they would ensure that it's able to
 
02:36:39.269 --> 02:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
comply with our state laws and our state
 
02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
privacy protections one of those that's
 
02:36:43.469 --> 02:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
important is the withdrawal system for
 
02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
the immunization immunization um for the
 
02:36:49.469 --> 02:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
IIs because if somebody is withdrawing
 
02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
and then you're pulling their IIs data
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
from another state but it hasn't been
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawn then because we don't retain
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
records of that withdrawal because of
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
privacy reasons then they would be
 
02:37:01.469 --> 02:37:01.479 align:start position:0%
involuntarily pulled back into the
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
system um so I know that it's complex
 
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
but if we are going to share people's
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
personal data we need to ensure that we
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
are going to honor their privacy and
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
their request for this um one of the
 
02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
good amendments that came in our
 
02:37:17.710 --> 02:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
committee was to make sure that we're
 
02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
also not reaching into an individual
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider's records because
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
number one we can't do that because of
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
HIPPA they need to keep that information
 
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
for seven years and number two trying to
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
reach into to the doctor that you went
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
to in Florida who then pulled your IIs
 
02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh because they thought that your
 
02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
tetanus might be in there because you
 
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
had stepped on some Coral or maybe in
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hawaii because you had stepped on some
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
Coral that now you don't need to go
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
overreach in and not just talk to their
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
IIs because you share the records but
 
02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
then also go into that urgent care
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
doctor and reach into their records
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
because if we create something that is
 
02:37:54.429 --> 02:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
just unworkable then it's un
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and we're wasting
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's time so there had been a
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
very significant fiscal note with what
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
we had initially introduced and um there
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
is now a revised fiscal note that pairs
 
02:38:07.469 --> 02:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
it down um to much much trimmer amount
 
02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
of money um and quite frankly that money
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to be spent until such
 
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
time as the department chose to share
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
the information with any any anybody out
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
of state um that's not currently
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
happening um but I know that having a
 
02:38:23.550 --> 02:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
road workor and a framework for what
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
would need to go into those rfps and
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
need to go into those processes is
 
02:38:29.550 --> 02:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
better to do ahead of time uh because
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
the last thing we want to do is spring
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
up and come up with uh some new
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
conditions at the last minute because
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work together on this uh
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
ahead I am does the committee have any
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions I I I have a basic question in
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
privacy it's all about risk mitigation
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the the threat that
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're facing the the risk associated
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
with having the Privacy um data exposed
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay the personal data exposed and and
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
then you mitigate it in a reasonable way
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
if did did your committee specifically
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
or have you specifically looked at what
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the risk the threat is the the
 
02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of a breach or or the
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
unintentional release of personal data
 
02:39:25.870 --> 02:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the cost because the cost of
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is still one more employee for the
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
state in a time where Workforce is tight
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
at 100,000 plus a year so so so what's
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
your sense of the the the threat that
 
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with and whether or
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
not 100,000 is is a is an approp amount
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
to spend well um thank you I think that
 
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's both threat and need um what is the
 
02:39:54.910 --> 02:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
need for us to share this information if
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
there is a potential of breach or a
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
potential that somebody's will to remove
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
themsel from the information IIs is not
 
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
honored and upheld because it's not just
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
about a breach it's also about if
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
somebody has chosen to remove that
 
02:40:10.429 --> 02:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
information they have the right under
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law to do so this would be
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that if that information is
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
shared with any other body that then
 
02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
their information is removed from that
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
other IIs system now if I was in Hawaii
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I stepped on a coral and they needed
 
02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
to check if tetanus was within the IIs I
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
could also tell them my primary care
 
02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
provider so that they could follow up on
 
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
that um and they could and there could
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
be a specific query to to get to my
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
primary my primary care they also could
 
02:40:41.469 --> 02:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and give me tetanus um
 
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
with my consent at that point because it
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
might be necessary so I even question
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
the need for us to share I our IIs
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
information with other states but if we
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
were to do that I think that we need to
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that any of those data
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
sharings would honor New Hampshire
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
law so so we would be diminishing our
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
ability to Pro provide good clinical
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
support to our residents out of when
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
they're out of state and they need
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
access to this data if we just simply
 
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
said that the data should not be
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
shared we don't share that data right
 
02:41:18.030 --> 02:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
now now so if we were to make that
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
decision to share it in the future we
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
should follow New Hampshire law when we
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
are sharing it I know this might feel a
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
little bit belt in suspenders but the
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
fact that it would need an employee in
 
02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
order to share it in a way that would be
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
compliant with our existing New
 
02:41:35.309 --> 02:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws um perhaps this simply
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
highlights the fact that it is going to
 
02:41:38.590 --> 02:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
cost us at least an additional
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 should we choose to enter into
 
02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
any agreements with any outside body to
 
02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
share our IIs information and perhaps
 
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
that would be something where we would
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
prohibit it without um maybe maybe it
 
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
could be something where we prohibit
 
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
entering into those contracts unless um
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
unless we are protecting privacy and
 
02:42:01.389 --> 02:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
that has the cost of another full-time
 
02:42:01.399 --> 02:42:03.030 align:start position:0%
that has the cost of another full-time
employee

02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman um in
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
addition to our statutory constraints
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
right the overwhelming majority at 81%
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
if I recall right who adopted Article 2
 
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
be right relative to privacy of
 
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
information I think that compels us to
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not sending this
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
information to other states in any
 
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
form and I think sorry if I can say
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
further with that um we had the
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
potential that people's livelihoods
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
would have been threatened for getting a
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine that was not required in New
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but was required to interact
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
and even go into McDonald's and other
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
states and if we were to share that
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
information um that somebody had tried
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
to withdraw from the registry and shared
 
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
it with with new New York and if there
 
02:42:48.990 --> 02:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
was some sort of criminal um penalty for
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to go in um and say that they
 
02:42:53.469 --> 02:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
had gotten their Co shop but hadn't and
 
02:42:55.870 --> 02:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
then somebody gets arrested and charged
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
I because we don't know what the next
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
reaction to the next disease is going to
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
be and while we may have had Shadows of
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
what could happen we need to recognize
 
02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
that there may be even stronger
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
reactions next time my hope would be
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we all realized that um we need to
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that cooler heads prevail in
 
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
everything that we do and denying
 
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
somebody the right to go by a meal
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense but we don't know
 
02:43:20.429 --> 02:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
what people will do in the future if we
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
did we wouldn't need as many of the laws
 
02:43:25.389 --> 02:43:25.399 align:start position:0%
as we do um and we need to make sure
 
02:43:26.910 --> 02:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't just have the harm of a
 
02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
data breach but we make sure that we
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
know whether it's necessary to share
 
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
this information and what specific harm
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
could come from a person having their
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
information shared thinking that they
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
had withdrawn it from the registry and
 
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
back do you have a question walner
 
02:43:49.070 --> 02:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
so how would the
 
02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:51.230 align:start position:0%
so how would the
department

02:43:51.230 --> 02:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
assure that this other entity another
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
state or another
 
02:43:59.550 --> 02:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
organization is honoring New Hampshire
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
law I mean how how will they go about
 
02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
doing that well um thank you so whenever
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
they enter into an agreement they need
 
02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
to enter into an agreement around how
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
information is shared so if we don't
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
specify this in our statutes they may
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
not include that in any contract or any
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
RFP or any other agreement that they
 
02:44:23.309 --> 02:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
have um I forget all of the terms but
 
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
basically it's basically it's mutual
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
agreements that they have with with
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
other other entities so if we don't set
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
that out as a condition for entering
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
into an agreement with any other body
 
02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
then it may not may not happen in the
 
02:44:38.269 --> 02:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
future and I know that they have a lot
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
to do I know we haven't staffed all we
 
02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to staff all of the
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
jobs they have so the more that we can
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
lay out and make clear as important
 
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
because as representative H said 81% of
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
people said that our personal privacy
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
and personal information needs to be
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
protected it would make sense to have it
 
02:44:56.269 --> 02:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
in statute so that they know that needs
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
to go into their contracts before the
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
information is
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
shared and I I used to be paid well to
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
be paranoid but not overly paranoid so
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
sorry if I come to you with some edge
 
02:45:08.190 --> 02:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
cases but they like that on Wall Street
 
02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:09.550 align:start position:0%
cases but they like that on Wall Street
thank

02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions do you have anything else to
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
say is there anyone else here that wants
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill anyone in the
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
audience okay with that uh we'll close
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing on U 1669 and just so you
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
know representative Leon um we're going
 
02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
to as a committee we're going to be
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
talking about it Monday afternoon so um

02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
just trying to find out before Monday
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon all right thank you uh HP

support just without if if you're here
 
02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:01.309 align:start position:0%
support just without if if you're here

up okay very good just wait wait a
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
second if you're here to introduce
 
02:46:16.950 --> 02:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
1564 stand
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:25.309 --> 02:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
1564 okay if you're here to introduce
 
02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
1595 please stand
 
02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
up okay so you're doing two of the
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
three you're doing you're you're doing
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
1595 that's
 
02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
1595 that's
the

02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
theing

02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
theing
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's the duration for child support
 
02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then nobody's here for
 
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
1564 all right so why don't you come on
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
up and we'll have you introduce both
 
02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
does

02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh my name is David
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
Beckford from new Dar and I'm going to
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
introduce to you uh HB 1282 relative the
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
duration of Child Support uh there was
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
an ERA in
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
the um former in the present law and so
 
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
what we've done here is mashed up what
 
02:47:41.469 --> 02:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
Social Security does for aging aging out
 
02:47:43.630 --> 02:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
and I I believe it's all okay our
 
02:47:46.349 --> 02:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
representative B really carried the ball
 
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
on this but I happened to know it was
 
02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
about uh copying Social Security and and
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
saying okay at the age of 18 you're done
 
02:47:57.790 --> 02:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
with child support unless you're in high
 
02:48:02.670 --> 02:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
school uh until age 19 or if you have um
 
02:48:06.429 --> 02:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
special needs I think it's stage
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
now oh down down at the
 
02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:16.269 align:start position:0%
now oh down down at the
bottom

02:48:16.269 --> 02:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
21 and I don't know why there there's a
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
it I have no idea why that would cost
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
any money maybe it's to set the
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
computers or something up that P I don't
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.429 --> 02:48:38.439 align:start position:0%
that okay are you ready for questions
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
sure okay so um I'm I'm just concerned
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of of um the Bold section
 
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's primarily on lines 14 15 and
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
16 and and so I I don't know if I'm just
 
02:48:57.790 --> 02:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
reading it wrong or if I'm just being
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
paranoid but does this mean with this
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
addition that an individual would stay
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
on this program in pity if they have a
 
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
disability or or is or is this a line
 
02:49:15.309 --> 02:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's meant to say something something
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
about whichever comes
 
02:49:20.229 --> 02:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
first I'm I'm not seeing the the the
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
disclaimer whichever comes first and I
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if it should be in
 
02:49:39.070 --> 02:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere geez I think it stops at the
 
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
21 that was I believe the
 
02:49:48.429 --> 02:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
intent but
 
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh um yeah we're supposed to It's
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to this is about stomping child
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
support at a certain
 
02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:56.750 align:start position:0%
support at a certain
age

02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
age
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
okay so do you think I'm
 
02:50:01.630 --> 02:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting I think so but I think
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
probably one why don't you ask one of
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
the attorneys from Child report here got
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of them do do you have an
 
02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
opinion on what I just asked on Mr
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
Williams or or do you have a different
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
attorney for that part you got John and
 
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
Susan bristen here John Williams yeah we
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're not struggling from a lack of
 
02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
think John and I went to law school
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
together I'm Susan bristen I'm the chief
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
staff attorney for child
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
support so so did you hear my question I
 
02:50:37.790 --> 02:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
can re rephrase it I did
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the way to read it is
 
02:50:44.990 --> 02:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
that there's no child no child support
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
after 21 for any child and even those
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that no longer qualify as a child
 
02:50:52.269 --> 02:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
disability um because I know that the
 
02:50:57.550 --> 02:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
huge emphasis is on the child who then
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
turns 21 is no longer a child and gets
 
02:51:05.150 --> 02:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.469 --> 02:51:07.479 align:start position:0%
Security you you're applying the or to
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
the wrong place I think CH is her
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
point so so we need we need to amend
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
this no
 
02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:15.910 align:start position:0%
this no
it

02:51:15.910 --> 02:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
it no child support order may continue
 
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
after 21
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
or no longer qualifies
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
right okay so then it would be Overkill
 
02:51:33.910 --> 02:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
first

02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
right that's just the the reading that
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
you would put on there that there's an
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
implied whichever comes first with that
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
or well I think I think the point is is
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that so we're talking about children
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
with disabilities they're getting child
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
support past the age of
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
18 and it ends either at 21 or if it's
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
determined that they no longer have a
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
disability right so you're talking about
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
whichever comes first is the
 
02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
ter it might not be either were I mean
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
somebody they might stay disabled and
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
they just age out as opposed to suddenly
 
02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
they're not disabled anymore okay I
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
think but I understand for your as well
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
um all right are there any other
 
02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions about this uh what what do you
 
02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
think the impact would be if we were to
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
defer this from 1 January of 25 to one
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
July of 25 to get it uh in sync with our
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
budget I I think some people at my
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
office might
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
cheer why is that just scheduling of
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
change es to the to the computer system
 
02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
which is the main um work that's going
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
to need to be to be done on this because
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
it emancipation dates are tracked by the
 
02:52:59.870 --> 02:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
computer so we'll have to we have to go
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
in and and change the logic to a great
 
02:53:04.990 --> 02:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
minds think alike before you got here we
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
asked Dave weers to to go ahead and
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
figure out how much time he needs to
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
implement if we did all of these so so
 
02:53:15.070 --> 02:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
so good thank you for the V validation
 
02:53:17.790 --> 02:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
of that I always try to agree with Dave
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
weers yeah it's smart so are there any
 
02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
1282 I'm not seeing any so we'll close
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
1282 thank you and then representative
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
bigford we'll we'll jump to um
 
02:53:40.429 --> 02:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
1595 yeah I'll be back just can you can
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
you introduce that one for
 
02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:50.309 align:start position:0%
you introduce that one for
us

02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:04.030 --> 02:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay I got a couple of things
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.279 --> 02:54:17.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.279 --> 02:54:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:48.399 --> 02:55:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.429 --> 02:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
you I think we're ready when you are
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
okay very good all right uh my name
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
again is David Beckford from new darham
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
and I also represent the town of
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
Middleton um and I'm here today to
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 1595
 
02:55:19.469 --> 02:55:19.479 align:start position:0%
and that is about um creating a formula
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the child support and the reason
 
02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
we're here to do that is
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
because we pay to have these reviews
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
done this one is the most recent one and
 
02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
it was a cost of
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
$116,000 and in it they have
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations I just read a few
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
sentences for you so New Hampshire is
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
one of nine states that does not provide
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
a formulaic adjustment for time sharing
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
in their child support guidelines based
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
on the findings from the case filed data
 
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
almost three4 of divorce and parenting
 
02:55:55.950 --> 02:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
petitions have a parenting plan that
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
provides that the child will be in the
 
02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
physical care of each parent for a
 
02:56:04.389 --> 02:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
significant share of the child's time
 
02:56:07.950 --> 02:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
the majority 61% of these cases deviate
 
02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire guidelines now
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
deviation is one of the reasons the
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
federal government told us we need to do
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
these every 4
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
years so that we can find out if we're
 
02:56:19.150 --> 02:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
our deviations are growing too much and
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
if they are we need to adjust the
 
02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines make uh so anyway the one we
 
02:56:27.550 --> 02:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
have uh chosen is something like the one
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
in Oregon which has a formula that was
 
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
developed to address the limitation of
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Cross credit formula it produces
 
02:56:36.510 --> 02:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
more gradual changes in the order amount
 
02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
when the child time with the obligor
 
02:56:42.429 --> 02:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
parent increases Oregon leaders report
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the formula has reduced uh
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
litigation and uh that's 200 Pages there
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
and part of that about that this is
 
02:56:53.710 --> 02:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
another one that came out in 2018 and uh
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
they sent this addendum to us in
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
2019 telling us attach you will find a
 
02:57:01.870 --> 02:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
reissuance of recommendation number
 
02:57:06.110 --> 02:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
three formula for Shared Parenting with
 
02:57:10.349 --> 02:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
the on page 59 to 62 with the correct
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
shared parenting formula for a new
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
presentation of the
 
02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
results and uh anyway they gave us all
 
02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
the same thing we need a formula as they
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
say not just a calculation but a formula
 
02:57:25.229 --> 02:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
this is goes back in
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
2009 we have we recommend the New
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopt the Shared Parenting
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment currently used in Vermont
 
02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
this involves multiplying the basic
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
order by
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 to account for the additional fixed
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
costs associated with raising a child in
 
02:57:43.710 --> 02:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
two homes and subtracting the amount
 
02:57:45.150 --> 02:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
directly ly proportional to the
 
02:57:47.790 --> 02:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
fractional of time the OBO spends with a
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.150 --> 02:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
overnights this goes back to
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
2004 and it was I was the vice chair on
 
02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
that committee and we recommended this
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
again the same thing on shared parenting
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
situations this is the family law task
 
02:58:09.630 --> 02:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
force it was created back in
 
02:58:14.910 --> 02:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
2004 and it has a recommendation
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
and it says because of the lack of a
 
02:58:18.070 --> 02:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
formula or at least a checklist of
 
02:58:20.110 --> 02:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
factors to be considered
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
parents have difficulty agreeing on
 
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
support in these situations the result
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
is often a feeling that the other parent
 
02:58:27.389 --> 02:58:27.399 align:start position:0%
is being
 
02:58:30.030 --> 02:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
unfair anger about that and then
 
02:58:31.870 --> 02:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
litigation certainly
 
02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:33.469 align:start position:0%
litigation certainly
litigation

02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
so um that goes uh back to then so and
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
even goes back to 1995 I have another
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
one goes all the way that that far back
 
02:58:45.229 --> 02:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
and yeah I'm almost done with the
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
problem okay I I had a a goal of closing
 
02:58:53.469 --> 02:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
by four and we can run over but um we're
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like you're validating
 
02:58:58.269 --> 02:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
the the policy part of this and the fact
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
that you've got good references in the
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
re in in this bill that the children and
 
02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
family law has reviewed and so from a
 
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
policy perspective it's pretty pretty
 
02:59:11.429 --> 02:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
solid right sure is and and so that
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
leaves the fiscal issue which is only
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
about out spending money on upgrading
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
the it which is another project that
 
02:59:22.429 --> 02:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
we've sent Mr weers back on uh so so I
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have many more
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
questions for you on this because it's
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
really about the it money since there's
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
no money at associated with this policy
 
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
right there's th this change in policy
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
isn't going to add more work or workload
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the department is it I don't think so
 
02:59:42.510 --> 02:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
okay so let me ask you a different
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
question and and and you've you've done
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
a good job in introducing it so have are
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
you familiar with
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
hb564 I'm going to ask you a question
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you're toally unprepared for
 
02:59:59.469 --> 02:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
probably okay so so this bill also goes
 
03:00:01.950 --> 03:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
into the same it system that needs to be
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
modified in your bill it goes in for a
 
03:00:08.510 --> 03:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
different part of the law changing the
 
03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
poverty level standard and and doing
 
03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
something about making making a poliy
 
03:00:16.349 --> 03:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
decision about agreeing with the parents
 
03:00:21.070 --> 03:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
or ordered by the court is is I'm just
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
for for you and maybe for the
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh do does anyone see any
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
value in trying to to merge these two
 
03:00:32.229 --> 03:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
bills with an amendment so that there's
 
03:00:35.950 --> 03:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
just one change to one It system as
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to two bills because uh it I
 
03:00:41.150 --> 03:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't know it just feels like it's too
 
03:00:43.150 --> 03:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
many bills when one might be able to do
 
03:00:46.190 --> 03:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
it I can help you with that go ahead I
 
03:00:49.950 --> 03:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
have uh uh prepared two amendments and
 
03:00:52.229 --> 03:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
one of them would take away the formula
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
in 64 which is not really a form it's a
 
03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
calculation because that only helps
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
people on the as I pointed out before
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
you have a single
 
03:01:04.349 --> 03:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
parent uh in the system and that's where
 
03:01:07.710 --> 03:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
our formulas are designed for guidelines
 
03:01:09.150 --> 03:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
then you have shared parenting which
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
both parents 50/50 so they take care of
 
03:01:13.229 --> 03:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
that and close to it it looks like about
 
03:01:13.239 --> 03:01:14.750 align:start position:0%
that and close to it it looks like about
10%

03:01:14.750 --> 03:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
10%
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
variation so now you got nothing in
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
between this bill that I'm presenting to
 
03:01:20.229 --> 03:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
you which I haven't get to the point
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
where all this I think it's um 18 states
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
do this type of formula and uh 41 states
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
have the uh income shares which we've
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
adopted um and so we can do everything
 
03:01:37.469 --> 03:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensively with this bill except
 
03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
the support
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
um SSR self support Reserve it's called
 
03:01:47.070 --> 03:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing is looking to
 
03:01:48.830 --> 03:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
bump it up because of the
 
03:01:52.030 --> 03:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh to 130% of poverty
 
03:01:54.030 --> 03:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
which it used to be one 100% at one time
 
03:01:56.429 --> 03:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
then it went to 115 now the
 
03:01:59.389 --> 03:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to go to 130 you
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned two amendments are you
 
03:02:03.990 --> 03:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
planning to introduce those today so
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're aware of them I was down my phone
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
so so what if we said we could have you
 
03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
back Monday but I do yeah Monday what I
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
do with M oh it's back here I I've got
 
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
the Amendments written out I just don't
 
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
have them in um OS form yes yeah okay I
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
I think we just need to wait until OS
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
has published something um so yeah do
 
03:02:31.469 --> 03:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
you think that might you might be able
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
to come back with those on
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
Monday yes I can okay uh representative
 
03:02:38.910 --> 03:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
Mooney question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
friendly suggestion actually division
 
03:02:44.309 --> 03:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
one was so kind to come in and host a
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
joint session for House Bill
 
03:02:49.870 --> 03:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
1573 my thought is because these bills
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
are related directly to child support
 
03:02:56.229 --> 03:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
formulas perhaps division one should
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
weigh in inevitably when child support
 
03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
formulas are
 
03:03:06.990 --> 03:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
revised increase in court
 
03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.510 align:start position:0%
revised increase in court
filings

03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
filings
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
occur and so for that reason um my
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
thought is perhaps division one should
 
03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh be a part of the discussion thank you
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
may I respond to that yes um I I think I
 
03:03:23.389 --> 03:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
think that's very uh fairm minded of you
 
03:03:25.510 --> 03:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
I I I would just say that this is a
 
03:03:28.269 --> 03:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
slightly different situation in that the
 
03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
only money either of these bills 95 and
 
03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
64 plann to spend are in it upgrades and
 
03:03:38.349 --> 03:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
the IT upgrades are both in the
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
where where Mr weers was here so so
 
03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:44.349 align:start position:0%
where where Mr weers was here so so
although

03:03:44.349 --> 03:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:03:46.269 --> 03:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
you know the policy committee has
 
03:03:49.070 --> 03:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
resolved the policy the only money being
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
spent is DHHS money which is division
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
three so so I don't know that division
 
03:03:58.269 --> 03:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
one needs to come in on this because
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's an IT spend issue not a funding a
 
03:04:05.309 --> 03:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
policy you know what I mean do you do
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
you agree or disagree I to
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
see I appreciate that I do see mention
 
03:04:13.389 --> 03:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch just that it may
 
03:04:15.309 --> 03:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
increase is an indeterminable amount
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
clause in the fiscal note uh so just
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
thought it was worth
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
mentioning that's a good point I didn't
 
03:04:24.229 --> 03:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
notice that they did get back to us say
 
03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
we we don't have we just asked them for
 
03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
another number through LBA and they said
 
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything for you terminal
 
03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay they said they can just do it
 
03:04:33.309 --> 03:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
through the training all right I um
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney just uh corrected
 
03:04:38.830 --> 03:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
me um there is a a a line in the fiscal
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
node saying this may result in an
 
03:04:43.070 --> 03:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in the judicial
 
03:04:44.910 --> 03:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
branch Branch expenditure so although
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not in the not in the table it's
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's left in there as a wedge and we
 
03:04:51.550 --> 03:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
could maybe just get a division one
 
03:04:55.950 --> 03:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
person to look at this all right um are
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
there go ahead I just got are you aware
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
that um the federal government pays for
 
03:05:01.950 --> 03:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the cost no I got it it's
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the yeah okay just make sure and
 
03:05:06.670 --> 03:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
there's possible possibility might get
 
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
some uh specialty money I can't remember
 
03:05:11.070 --> 03:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
the name of it which pays up to 90% but
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
you we can't use it now we have to say
 
03:05:17.309 --> 03:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
after the bill is passed and they want
 
03:05:19.710 --> 03:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
to go down the child support can then
 
03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
ask for it from yeah lost I think okay
 
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
if you get those amendments uh when you
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
get them would you just forward them to
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
me and I'll as early as possible and
 
03:05:32.349 --> 03:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
we'll try to talk through them on on
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon oh okay do you want me
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
to come in too or you just want the well
 
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
if you need to explain the amendment it'
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
probably be a good
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
idea and and take a look at 1564 if you
 
03:05:47.790 --> 03:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind taking an additional task
 
03:05:51.229 --> 03:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
and see if if 1564 lives within one of
 
03:05:51.239 --> 03:05:52.349 align:start position:0%
and see if if 1564 lives within one of
your

03:05:52.349 --> 03:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
amendments it is it does I see a shaking
 
03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
head okay I I've got the it's always
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
good to be a yes I have two the
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
Amendments now if you want to but
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're not the official no no I don't
 
03:06:07.790 --> 03:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
want to do explanation of them yeah I I
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
I I want us to stay on track with the OS
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
because if because if OS doesn't produce
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
it or they produce it wrong then we
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be voting for it anyway so we
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
have to wait yeah makes sense uh are
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
there other questions for representative
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
Bickford um I'm going to um technically
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
open 15 HP 1564
 
03:06:30.750 --> 03:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and I think we've
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
discussed it with
 
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:35.880 align:start position:0%

sufficiently enjoyable it was all of the
 
03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
above and it made my mind spin with all
 
03:08:01.950 --> 03:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
the needed reading that I need to catch

03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
member a private citizen is interested
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
in written t testimony here I believe
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
person here um don't know whether we
 
03:08:19.229 --> 03:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
want to have them share instead of
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
forcing them to come back a second
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
time um before we close I I I haven't
 
03:08:28.110 --> 03:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
