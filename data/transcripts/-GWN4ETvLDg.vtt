00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to make sure that everything
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
is lined up before we are here
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and start presenting
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
um I do have this piece of paper here
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
from representative Merchant so I'd like
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
to recognize him to speak thank you
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
last time we talked about three issues
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
that we tried to address we'd like to
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
address in the bill
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
one was the issue of who gets to use the
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
the data and we want to be sure it was
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
restricted to a clinical care of the
 
00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:18.829 align:start position:0%
restricted to a clinical care of the
patient

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
two we talked about the issue of consent
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
which is in lines two sorry 12 to 13 and
 
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.569 align:start position:0%
which is in lines two sorry 12 to 13 and
14.

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
14.
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
and lastly which is the thicket one is
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
the issue about de-identified patient
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
data and where it goes for
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
clinical research and clinical or
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
genetic analysis which is lines 15 16-17
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I proposed to the subcommittee
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
this as a draft against only a working
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
graph that hasn't been sent to OLS for
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
drafting but I wanted to start with this
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
as a place to have a conversations
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
so I guess my first question is just to
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that um that by having it in
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
this section does this take away from
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
the constraints we have on clinical
 
00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.949 align:start position:0%
the constraints we have on clinical
laboratories

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
laboratories
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
um because I do know that there are the
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
other sections that speak to use the
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
genetic testing in other situations and
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
so I want to make sure that we don't
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
dilute what we're doing about clinical
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
laboratories in an effort to solve this
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem which in which may or may not be
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
the exact right section of the statue
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
each of these
 
00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.889 align:start position:0%
each of these
um

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
each of these
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
paragraphs refer to this section so
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
whatever we say here when we go for our
 
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.569 align:start position:0%
whatever we say here when we go for our
section

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I just want to make sure
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we're not taking away from what
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with the clinical
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
laboratories by having it in the Statue
 
00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:51.170 align:start position:0%
laboratories by having it in the Statue
too

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.129 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
as I review this I'm going to take an
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
eye to that did you want to speak
 
00:13:55.139 --> 00:14:26.150 align:start position:0%
eye to that did you want to speak
representative

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I think this is helpful I guess one
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think this is helpful and I really
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
like the language on the first three
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
paragraphs so all of line from 3 to 14
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and and it now does flow
 
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.290 align:start position:0%
um and and it now does flow
from

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
what's already in the statute but
 
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.949 align:start position:0%
what's already in the statute but
um

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
I think the thing that we're going to
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
get hung up on once again is the use of
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
the identified data that's in the last
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
paragraph so
 
00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
paragraph so
um

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still trying to come up with a
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
formulation that I'm comfortable with
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's uh because what we're saying here
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
is on lines three to seven we're making
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
it very clear that the patient can
 
00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:25.750 align:start position:0%
it very clear that the patient can
consent

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of of diagnosis and
 
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of of diagnosis and
treatment

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.150 align:start position:0%
treatment
and

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
8 through 11 also refers to entities
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
participating in clinical care
 
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.650 align:start position:0%
participating in clinical care
um

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
and then we again say
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're not waiving the requirement that
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
the treating position physician obtains
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
specific informed patient consent
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
I've I've looked at several formulations
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
for 15 through 17.
 
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
for 15 through 17.
and

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we've gotten there yet on
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to provide access to
 
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:21.260 align:start position:0%
de-identified data
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
and I I will also say that
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to de-identified data I
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
also have a proposed I think it was sent
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
to everybody a proposed definition from
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Neil Kirk that
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell would de-identify
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
data so much that it wouldn't be useful
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
for research
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
because it de-identifies every single
 
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.470 align:start position:0%
because it de-identifies every single
solitary

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
solitary
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
characteristic that you would want to
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
know about
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
stuff but I'm I'm willing to be
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
persuaded and and once the subcommittee
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
is disgusting I I would ask that we
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
could hear from the folks who've come to
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
watch us fumble with this watch a
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
struggle with difficult tasks I have
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
similar I have a similar view of this I
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
think lines 3 through 14
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
um look good my one question would be if
 
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.090 align:start position:0%
um look good my one question would be if
um

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
if um it's necessary to still include
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
the evaluating potential clinical care
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
options within that language because I
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
do want to make sure that the third
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
party used in order to make sure that
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
patients are are evaluated and offered
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
as many clinical trial options as
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
possible is not limited by the language
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we have I don't think it is but I
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to raise that concern
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the very important
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
parts of this legislation I I have a
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
very very large problem with this
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
de-identified patient data and
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
especially when you're looking to
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
retroactively open up access to people's
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
medical records when they may or may not
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
have consented I I don't know if there's
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
some way to add an additional consent
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
for somebody to blanket consent for a
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
de-identified data in the future for
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
clinical research and while that may not
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
give us the same access to historical
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
data at least we could start now having
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
people consent for their information to
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
be used on used in future research so
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they can open this up should they
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
choose to do that some people donate
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
their bodies to science if people are
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
willing to to donate their genetic
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
information and and more of their
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
medical record to science I think we
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
should enable that but I don't think
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we should do that for people
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
without specific consent although I'm
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly how to put that into
 
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.890 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly how to put that into
language

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I totally agree
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
with both my colleagues on the
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it's um trying to thread
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
the needle here
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
with how to protect the patient in the
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that goes particularly
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
with DNA and genetic information however
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
try to Foster and support clinical
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
research which is really necessary in
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
the backbone of what we do to Foster
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
better care
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how to word it we
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
could possibly talk about the issue of
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
when the patient consents to providing
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the consent form so
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
basically at that point in time is when
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
the patient can sense the release of
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
de-identified data
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
that could be another way to maybe word
 
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
that could be another way to maybe word
it

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are you thinking of including
 
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
that within the whole consent or having
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
that as a separate additional level of
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.090 align:start position:0%
that as a separate additional level of
consent

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
how long do we want the form
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
um I hear you
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to be clear in the
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
consent form that when the patient is
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
consenting they understand what they're
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
consenting to so I think at that point
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
in time is that it probably should be
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
part of the Forum but I get nervous
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
about trying to then incorporate this
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
into the consent form because then we
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
have to think about
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
possibly incorporating other things into
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
the consent form I'm trying to avoid
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you that does bring up the sticky
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
situation I
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
um I know some people may be fine to be
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
involved in current clinical research
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
but may not want to be looked back and
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
said you know you're a gun owner do you
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a different cancer profile and are
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
you going to bring that in together and
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about limiting people who
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
are participating in current clinical
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
research because they're worried about
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
what future clinical research they may
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
be included in either shortly in the
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
future or even after their death
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want any chilling effects on
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
people that will be contributing to
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
research so I just want to figure out
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
how not to make the form too long I
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
think the Safeguard here as long as it
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
does remain de-identified
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
you are in essence but we are
 
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.289 align:start position:0%
you are in essence but we are
collectively

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
protecting a certain level of
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
confidentiality on behalf of the patient
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
when you get into identifiable
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
information I get really really nervous
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
but if it's de-identified we provide to
 
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
but if it's de-identified we provide to
the

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
public a lot of de-identified
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
information from many sources
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
um in the aggregate or maybe we should
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
which then also brings the problem of
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
rare diseases and I guess as we look at
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
it as a possibility of gun owners and
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
their exposure to let the question would
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
be then um if somebody if we were
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
looking at ovarian cancer and somebody
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
who had undergone an abortion to to make
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
sure that we're protecting people
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
throughout all of the spectrum's
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
information from potentially potentially
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
useful but also more personal
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
um personal leaning research
 
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.669 align:start position:0%
um personal leaning research
true

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
I would if it's deodemified it's hard to
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
trace it back to a particular individual
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we de-identify it
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
so at that level even though I'm a gun
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
owner and so forth it'd be hard for me
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
to at that point in time determine
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
who's a gun owner who's not a gun owner
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
because there's no way to identify the
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
patient and Link it back to their
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
behavior or their
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
now I'm back to first of all wondering
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
what the folks out there think about
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
this because they're going to have to
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
live with it and and second for myself
 
00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:25.370 align:start position:0%
live with it and and second for myself
um

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
I mean the more I the more I read all of
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
this the more I come around to this
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.169 align:start position:0%
thought that
uh

00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the statute is it now stands is really
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
quite clear to me
 
00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
quite clear to me
and

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we're muddying the
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
waters more than we're clarifying them
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
the bill originated
 
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.330 align:start position:0%
the bill originated
as

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
some I I I do understand that it
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
clarifies using
 
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.490 align:start position:0%
clarifies using
um

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:03.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
data data rather than specimens
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
um so in that respect it's a good thing
 
00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.409 align:start position:0%
um so in that respect it's a good thing
but

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm more comfortable with the
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
beginnings part with the stuff up
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
through line 14 than I am for 15 through
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
17. and I wonder if that isn't the
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
subject of a different piece of
 
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.730 align:start position:0%
subject of a different piece of
legislation

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:27.740 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.450 align:start position:0%
legislation
or

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know as As Time ticks on I think
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
about retention
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
but I'd love to help out with the first
 
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
but I'd love to help out with the first
part

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
if we can do that
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
I I would agree that through line 14 I'd
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
be comfortable moving forward
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
um if 15 through 17 needed to be part of
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
it I also would lean towards retention
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
but there's people that may not live to
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
see January that I want to make sure
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
have access to clinical trials right so
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
I would rather
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
um rather separate off that 15 to 17.
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
I I would like to invite both of you up
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to share any insight that
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
seems to be the way that we're leaning
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
and if there's anything to convince us
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
of something that um where we would be
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
causing a problem by deferring the
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
de-identified patient data for a later
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
bill I would definitely like to know if
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the language works and if that that
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for continuing to
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
address this I really appreciate your
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
your working through it
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh one through 14 going through
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
will be a big step forward so I will
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that moving forward the
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
um as far as the de-identified data goes
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber I think you
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
referred to what former representative
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
Kirk can put forward
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
the standard of de-identification that
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
actually very very closely parallels
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
what the the federal standard is for
 
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.169 align:start position:0%
what the the federal standard is for
de-identification

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
de-identification
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
so that is not uh while that is limiting
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
the the point of that de-identification
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
is that de-identified data
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
cannot be traced back to any particular
 
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.990 align:start position:0%
cannot be traced back to any particular
individual

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
um so it still allows for a lot of
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
research there right so we can talk
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
about the the
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
care pathway that an unknown individual
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
went through we can talk about the
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
results that an unknown individual
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
obtained by certain treatments and
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
things like that while certainly a
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
limited data set which is to say that it
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
includes any of those identifiers that
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
doctor or sorry represent former
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk had pointed out if
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
any if it transgresses any one of those
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
right we need to know any of those 18
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
unique identifiers then we would refer
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
to as a limited data set it doesn't mean
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
that that includes the person's name but
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so so even though it's talking about
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
de-identified is to say that all of
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
those identifiers have been stripped out
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then we will consider kind of what
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
we know about an an unnamed unknown
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
person so that allows us to do a lot of
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
of research without any identities being
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
used there the
 
00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
used there the
um

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
so continuing with that HHS standard
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be a big help for us to to do
 
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.169 align:start position:0%
would be a big help for us to to do
research

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:34.130 align:start position:0%
research
um

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh with all of the strictness of that
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
that standard
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the the last one you know the section
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
allows for the disclosure of the
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
identified patient data is a little bit
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
of a confusing statement to me because
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly whom is disclosing
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
to whom in the and so that I I think
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for is just the use of
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
de-identified data that's data related
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
to a to unknown persons may be used
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
within the covered energy covered entity
 
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.909 align:start position:0%
within the covered energy covered entity
for

00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:07.700 align:start position:0%
I would say research oh
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
within the cupboard any necessary to
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
conduct clinical research or genetic
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
analysis neither of those would actually
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
be true on the identified data right we
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do clinical reasons we're
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
not doing anything to a specific person
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
obviously you're going to do it to the
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
person you need to know who they are so
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do clinical research
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
because um uh you you said something
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
about within the covered entity and that
 
00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:36.409 align:start position:0%
about within the covered entity and that
already

00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
makes me a little more happy because
 
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:42.860 align:start position:0%
it's not going outside the cover entity
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh whereas when we when we got this to
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
begin with it really read like it could
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
go anywhere so if you have
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
within the covered entity language I'd
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
love to hear it and if we could maybe
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
combine that if if we use limits are
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay for you
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if limiting to the use
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
within the covered entity which I assume
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
in this case in your case would be dark
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
and medical is that right the covered
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
entity would be would be Dartmouth
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
Health Dartmouth Hitchcock it would
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
actually exclude the college uh from our
 
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.190 align:start position:0%
by then okay
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.130 align:start position:0%
by then okay
[Music]

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
is covered entity defined somewhere in
 
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:40.990 align:start position:0%
is covered entity defined somewhere in
the

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
yeah Comfort entity is defined under uh
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
the health insurance portability uh
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
HIPAA as it's well known and the only
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
other thing I might add is uh former
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative kirkenheit communicated
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
about the language with respect to the
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
definition of de-identified data and
 
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.930 align:start position:0%
definition of de-identified data and
while

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:01.940 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be to just
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
incorporate by reference to the federal
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines he clearly would prefer to
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
spell out each of the 18 or so criteria
 
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:16.580 align:start position:0%
plus and and we are not
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
objecting to that articulation if that's
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
de-identified data may be used
 
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.049 align:start position:0%
de-identified data may be used
for

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:41.389 align:start position:0%
for
clinical

00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
research I would actually sorry if I may
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
interrupt retrospective research might
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
just for research or just research would
 
00:29:59.570 --> 00:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
be helpful but but to be clear you you
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't use the identified data for
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
clinical research so we'd be creating a
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
I put in retrospective so we know that
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.389 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
that if we said solely within the
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
covered entity
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'm just looking
 
00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:31.370 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'm just looking
at

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
the definition here that I found through
 
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.049 align:start position:0%
the definition here that I found through
NIH

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
NIH
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
and it's broader than I assumed I
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
thought of a covered entity being dark
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
with Hitchcock health or Dartmouth
 
00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:42.490 align:start position:0%
with Hitchcock health or Dartmouth
health

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:42.500 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
but according to the definition here
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
because you're about the issue with
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
HIPAA which I don't I just I
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
makes me nervous when you talk about hip
 
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.010 align:start position:0%
makes me nervous when you talk about hip
and

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
people within HIPAA that consider
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
covered entities
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
it does include Health Plans Health Care
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
clearinghouses Health Care Providers
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
electronic transmit information to the
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh connections and so forth so it's
 
00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:08.899 align:start position:0%
broader than what it
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
includes cover that is as defined by
 
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.610 align:start position:0%
includes cover that is as defined by
HIPAA

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
HIPAA
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
health plans
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
Healthcare clearinghouses health care
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
providers who electronically transplant
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
any health information in connection
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
with transactions which HHS has adopted
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
standards so it basically comes down to
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
is what I call before which I've sort of
 
00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:32.299 align:start position:0%
objected to is a business associate
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
is that definition one that is saying
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
any of these things can be a covered
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
entity or is that definition saying all
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
of these things are included within the
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
covered entity because it sounds to me
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
like they are saying these are the
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
things which could be could each
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
individually be a covered entity not
 
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.630 align:start position:0%
individually be a covered entity not
collectively

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
my read on this right now I'll let
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else look it over
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
means the second it's inclusive it
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
includes everything it's not separate
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
what's another way of saying HIPAA
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
business associate
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I would agree that without further
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
limitations on it no matter how we read
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
it that's likely how it would be
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted by people in the future and
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
that language also is not is it is too
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
broad for me
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
is there a another term that would cover
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
your uses between Dartmouth health and
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
to allow postdocs to actually do some of
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
this research
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
although I'm also wary about crafting
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
laws specific for entities so that
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:43.460 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if individual institution
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
works better for you I I will say
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
on the ground to someone that governs
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
the data we would consider sort of
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
represented whatever your your
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
the former interpretation to be how we
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
understand it that the covered entity
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
does not include those that each of
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
those could be a covered entity we would
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
never consider those as part of our
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
cover and covered entity I I can't
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
comment to how the whole world might
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
understand that but we've always
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
understood at the in the former sense
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
that those
 
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.070 align:start position:0%
that those
are

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
those are covered entities they're not
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
us but they are themselves covered
 
00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:24.049 align:start position:0%
us but they are themselves covered
entities

00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
um but if individual institution would
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
I I think what we're looking for is just
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
to work within our own house we're not
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
looking to share it outside of that and
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
whatever language feels best to do that
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking for we're not
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
trying for
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
and and run around that in order to move
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
it outside of the institution and that
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
was where I thought this would sort of
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
lock it down by saying covered entity
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
um but when I go back and look at the
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
definition it's a little broader than I
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
person thought
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
could you give me the side of stimulio
 
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.030 align:start position:0%
could you give me the side of stimulio
yeah

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
right but that that to me reads it says
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
covered identifies are defined in the
 
00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:31.849 align:start position:0%
covered identifies are defined in the
HIPAA

00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
HIPAA
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
rules as health plans Health Care
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
Clearing Houses but those are each each
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
of those things is an individual covered
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
entity it's not in the aggregate
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
I look at it the other way it looks like
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
it's in the aggregate not in the
 
00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:48.649 align:start position:0%
it's in the aggregate not in the
individual

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
so we'd say a covered entity it gets
 
00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:54.619 align:start position:0%
back into the HIPAA business associate
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
which I'm trying to get to
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and my question would be within a
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
covered entity versus within the covered
 
00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:02.990 align:start position:0%
covered entity versus within the covered
entity

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
because if it's the governance state
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
that received the consent that would be
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
more limiting than a
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
um can I zoom back out a little bit and
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
get a better understanding about what
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
kind of retrospective research you're
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
looking to do so I can understand what
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
the end goal is so we can figure out the
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
best way to meet this sure and and this
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of where the community
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
this prospective consent for future use
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
of data would get a little bit
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
complicated right because it's hard to
 
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.609 align:start position:0%
complicated right because it's hard to
anticipate

00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere that someone might want to do
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
research right so for instance right now
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
we would have data on breast cancer
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
patients that included some genomic
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
information that then a gynoc doctor who
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
wants to research ovarian cancers might
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
be looking to that data that we have
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
within our medical record but hadn't
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
been their patient at any point so
 
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:58.220 align:start position:0%
that's where we would want to use
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
de-identified no way to link it to an
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
actual a specific person
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
to use information that we had in order
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
to better understand this disease this
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
new disease process that's been
 
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.690 align:start position:0%
new disease process that's been
identified

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
so the prospective consent to that
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a little bit tricky because it's
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
hard to know what other researchers
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
might eventually have you know
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
meaningful ideas to investigate
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
so with that you're even talking about
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
matching controls for somebody else
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
within the system to have somebody with
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
a similar genetic makeup to see what
 
00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:36.859 align:start position:0%
their course was or no or or
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
specifically so of the patients who had
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
a specific subtype of ovarian cancer how
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
many of them were positive for this Gene
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
that we were already testing for a
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
different cancer
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
again we're there's no clinical research
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's strictly retrospective so there
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
would we're not talking about matching
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
cohorts in a prospective study it would
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
only be used in retrospective analysis
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
is going to clarify the covered entities
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
are separate but they're linked to the
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
business associate agreement but but
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
they've got a definition here of covered
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
entities and business associates
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
and what it says about business
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
associates is if a current and covered
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
entity engages a business associate to
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
help it carry out its Health Care
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
activities and functions the covered
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
entity must have a written business
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
associate contract or other arrangement
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
with the associate that establishes
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
specifically what that associate has
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
been engaged to do and requires the
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
business associate to require with the
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
rules requirement to protect the privacy
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
and security of the health information
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
talked about a covered entity and its
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
business associate and lifted that chunk
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
of requirement of a written
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
contract about what the business
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
associate is doing
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
would that be a way of limiting the use
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
of de-identified data that would on the
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
one hand make it
 
00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.300 align:start position:0%
still useful to you and and
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
but limited enough in scope that we're
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
not announcing it to the entire world it
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
that would be fine to be honest I think
 
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's even broader than what I'm
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
looking for so I would really be fine
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
with cover densities and excludes their
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
business associates well I'm I'm fine
 
00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're not engaging other systems there
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's we don't need business
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
associates in doing our research the way
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
that we need them to do our clinical
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
care would we on line 16 says within a
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
covered entity change the
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
within a to within the yeah well what I
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
what I would propose is to start again
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
with a new sentence and say
 
00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:12.970 align:start position:0%
with a new sentence and say
um

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
de-identified data may be used for
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
retrospective research within the
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
covered entity period
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
and then say and then use representative
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
Kirk's list
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
de-identify I would change it a bit and
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
say de-identified data is data from
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
which the following information
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
has been removed and then do the list
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
would that get us
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
to a place we're all comfortable with
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I think that moves us closer when we
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
look at the covered entity I'm saying
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's a healthcare provider a health plan
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
or a healthcare Clearinghouse my
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
question would be if narrowing it to a
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
health care provider and a academic or
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
an academic research institution would
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
get us closer to the idea of being able
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
to have this information and then work
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
with those because if you're doing
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
research you're either in a clinic doing
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
research or you're an academic
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
institution and we definitely shouldn't
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
the NRL you could be in the commercial
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
industry and be working within Pharma
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that this should be
 
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:27.020 align:start position:0%
opened up to them
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
so if we were to have the health care
 
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:31.460 align:start position:0%
provider or an academic research
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
institution would that Cut the Cake cut
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
the slices a little bit narrower and
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
better to find where we're trying to
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that the information can be
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
used or am I uh in left field I'm I'm
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
working on this healthcare provider or
 
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:46.820 align:start position:0%
the second one was a
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
academic research Institution
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
or am I going too far okay so and I'm
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
limiting this in my sentence to the
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
covered identity a covered identity
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is a health care provider or
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
academic research Institution
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
may use de-identified
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
may use de-identified data
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
can I just can I ask a question of the
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
community because I don't have the
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
language in front of me of what they
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
enumerate as a covered entity could you
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
share that well the the
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just trying to remember
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of different covered
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
identity that we were concerned about
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
but what I am writing here is a covered
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
entity which is a health care provider
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
or academic research Institution
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay Alexa
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
this talks about different types
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
of energy to understand reading this
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're really separate tenant the only
 
00:43:10.569 --> 00:43:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
but I think it does this healthcare
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
provider as the First Healthcare first
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
type of Relativity right so when I what
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
I now have is a covered identity a
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
covered entity which is a health care
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
provider or academic research
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
institution may use de-identified data
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
to construct conduct retrospective
 
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.970 align:start position:0%
to construct conduct retrospective
research

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
and then the next sentence is
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
de-identified data is data from which
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
the following information has been
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
removed and then we put in the laundry
 
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.010 align:start position:0%
removed and then we put in the laundry
list

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm liking the direction of this I'm
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if the de-identified data
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
should live in 141 H colon to a just
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
separate because this is getting a
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more complex with those
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
definitions or if we just keep adding it
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
in here well like the section I mean you
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
you break the section down into
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
subsections okay
 
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
um but I think
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to have this definition
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
again migrate over
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
into any any other anywhere else and so
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
it should probably say for purposes of
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
clear about again health care provider
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're trying to lock it down to the one
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
it actually is collecting and using the
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
data because a healthcare provider
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
include anyone who's in health care
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
so therefore you have different types of
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
covered entities within the term
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider so I think
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Weber could be going
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
because it really locks it down to the
 
00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:50.780 align:start position:0%
academic Medical Center that the
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
institution that's actually collecting
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:09.069 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's not my my Ultimate Dream for
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
research but it is a big step forward
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate all of this
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
and this would all come after signing
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
the consent so this would not be
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
reaching back into anybody who has not
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
we have to be clear about that though as
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
well okay well I I suppose this is the
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
situation where we're talking about when
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
the de-identified data is when we can't
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
obtain consent
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
so this would be changing the terms on
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
which people collected their had their
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
genetic testing done previously no no no
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
um so this is only on data so it's not
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
on specimens so we would not be going
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
back and performing
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
tests on specimens that we had
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
previously collected and there is
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
consent at the time of testing in order
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
to have genetic testing done but the use
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
of the data the the point of using
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
de-identified data is because we're in
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
situations where we cannot obtain
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
consent from individuals
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
so what did they consent to when they
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
gave their genetic information
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
well typically they're in reality on the
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
ground they're consenting to the test
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
itself so even if you're seen in the
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
cancer center at the time that you would
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
come to collect genomic data you would
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
have an appointment in the genetics
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
Clinic where you would be have your
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
consent would be specifically your
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
appointment your care your consent would
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
all be to have those genetic tests done
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and talk about the implications for your
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
for your health
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
so people would have consented to their
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
genetic testing at that time in their
 
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:52.220 align:start position:0%
clinical care we would not obtain
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
genetic tests on anyone that had not
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
consented to it would somebody be able
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
to have the genetic test without
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
consenting for their data to be used in
 
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.849 align:start position:0%
consenting for their data to be used in
research

00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.859 --> 00:47:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
right yes I I don't know that in every
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
situation where someone has come in and
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
gotten care and had a genetic test done
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they specifically consented to
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
research on their data
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
but I guess looking forward are you
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
saying that all of this would be wrapped
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
in that in order to have the genetic
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
testing you would also consent to your
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
data being used or would that be a
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
separate consent so you can have the
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
testing done you can choose to have your
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
information used to look for options for
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
you but you can say no I don't want my
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
data used for anybody else would that be
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
possible or would that not be possible
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
with what you are looking at
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
sorry let me go ahead and answer the
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
question the way the way I interpret the
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
way that I interpret the question is
 
00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:52.339 align:start position:0%
answered in
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh the previous sections so you're
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
getting you're getting consent for care
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
and testing and then you're getting
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
consent to participating clinical
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
research you certainly don't have to
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
consent to participate in clinical
 
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.170 align:start position:0%
consent to participate in clinical
research

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
so we are putting these as separate
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
check boxes on the consent form we're at
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
specific authorization
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
that's why I believe we're headed okay
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's what I would like to see in this
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
because if you're withholding with if
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're withholding a service conditional
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
on your consent for other options that's
 
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.140 align:start position:0%
not really consent
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
and and the way I'm reading it is the
 
00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:28.250 align:start position:0%
and and the way I'm reading it is the
way

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um Mr hood is reading it uh we have the
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
lines 12 13 14 and says which is very
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
strong language it says nothing in this
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to waive the
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
requirement that the treating physician
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
obtains specific informed patient
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
consent in accordance with provisions of
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
this section for clinical research so we
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
said first you got to get the consent
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
and then a covered entity which is a
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
health care provider
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
may use de-identified data
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
for these purposes
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
I concur with that if I look at three
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
through seven
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's providing consent for treatment
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
right that's for myself
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
if I look through lines 12-14 I'm giving
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
consent to use the information in
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
clinical research right and they're two
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
separate things
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
for although clinical research involves
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
the patient right so so you're you're in
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
a you're enrolled in a protocol or
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
you're enrolled in a clinical trial so
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
clinical research which those things are
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
followed to find out if that protocol is
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
working in fact clinical trial is
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
working certainly every patient that
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
participates in that has very explicit
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
consent but it's actually much more
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
extensive and much more explicit than
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
just a consent to care
 
00:49:46.619 --> 00:49:47.450 align:start position:0%
just a consent to care
um

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
so for clinical research there's a yes a
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
lengthy explicit
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
Insight so how about if we then revise
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
this piece that we're still working on
 
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.589 align:start position:0%
this piece that we're still working on
is

00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:10.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
is to put a specific consent requirement
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
on the use of de-identified data as well
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
but that gets you
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
nowhere is that what I'm seeing from
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
that really gets us nowhere
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh it gets you the future it loses the
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
whole past but that whole past is not
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
accessible at this point correct
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
it was the only thing sorry
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
um Dr moral can answer this question in
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
a better clinical sense but the the
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of the de-identification
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
is so that you you can't identify who
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
the the information comes from because
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
you strip away all those 18 plus things
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's the only way that you look at the
 
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.809 align:start position:0%
that's the only way that you look at the
past

00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
so this is basically built off of
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
somebody's medical record who owns the
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
medical record the patient or the
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
provider the patient owns the medical
 
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.849 align:start position:0%
provider the patient owns the medical
record

00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
so I guess to me I I'd be happy to
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
provide this information going forward
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
but um I don't like changing the terms
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
under which people received care and
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
received testing in the past so to me
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
that would be a major sticking point
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I do know that I did look and I saw
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
our emerging medical Technologies
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission did also pass the Senate
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
unamended so that may this may be a
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
better discussion for that committee
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
because that's speaking to emerging
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
medical medical Technologies and
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
emerging medical research so being able
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
to facilitate this retrospective look on
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
data I believe what would dovetail very
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
but I'm interested in how the rest of
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
the committee feels on the idea of
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
allowing a look back to people who did
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
not specifically consent to this versus
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to suggest we draft up two
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
amendments and submit them to the
 
00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:22.910 align:start position:0%
amendments and submit them to the
committee

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
one that um leaves retrospective data
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
separate and one which discusses I I
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
would draft two amendments one of which
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
is sections one to fourteen
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
which we are all quite in agreement with
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and then a second one that has
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
and I think the way I would phrase it
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear that we are doing
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
something different is in addition a
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
covered entity which is a health care
 
00:52:49.559 --> 00:52:51.049 align:start position:0%
covered entity which is a health care
provider

00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
may use the de-identified data to
 
00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:56.270 align:start position:0%
may use the de-identified data to
construct

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
construct
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
conduct retrospective research so people
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
really know what they're voting on and
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
de-identified data means this and then
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
we can just go on having this discussion
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
endlessly in committee but it
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
it provides us it provides us the option
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
for at least doing part of it and having
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
the discussion about the rest of it
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
that helps I guess um I I did want to
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
ask you if you know what the standards
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
are for the international Council on
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
harmonization for research if they allow
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
this look back on data or not because I
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
know that that there's a big issue
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
around reaching back into people's data
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
without specific consent
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with her
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
with their position okay
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's I I personally have no problem
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
going forward and being being future
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
looking so maybe it may be a matter of
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
three amendments to look at as well
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'm sorry I'm
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
not understanding what the third one
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
would be one that only allows the
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
research on retrospective um
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
de-identified data if they consent to
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
that because I could see somebody
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
consenting to current clinical research
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
but not wanting to be opened up for all
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
future data mining right representative
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
kind of words method this section allows
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
for the disclosure a de-identified
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
patient data with a consent of the
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
patient so therefore if you get consent
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
from the patient you can go back as far
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
as you want because they're providing
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
you that consent
 
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:26.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
clumsy but it's one of those things at
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
least you're getting consent from the
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
patient if you only want to do it going
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
forward you'd have to do that every
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
single time but if you want to go back
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
retroactively you'd have to get the
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
patient's consent to do that number two
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
such data shall remain within the
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
covered entity that collected the data
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
as necessary to conduct clinical
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
research or genetic analysis so it's
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
very clear stays within the covered
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
entity they collected it
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
if I made so I
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
I I understand your concern but I I
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
think that there's a
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
um a split the the use of a
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
de-identified data is specifically used
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
in the situation where you can't get
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
consent so to add this element of you
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
must use consent you must obtain consent
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
to use the identified data the role of
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
de-identified data in research is in
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
these unconsensable situations so I
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
I I feel like we're creating a new
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
constraint that doesn't really
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
understand that the on the ground the
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
reason that we're using that in the
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
first place right that if we're going
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
and attaining consent then we would look
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
for limited data sets or identify data
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
or things that were more expansive
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
because people had including themselves
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
we we have this very restrictive
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
de-identified data in these situations
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
where we can't obtain consent so
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
marrying the restrictive data to a new
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
consent process actually really
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
undermines the role of de-identified
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
and he identified data
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
is different than limited de-identified
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
data so if we want to go back to limited
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
de-identified data we'd have to go back
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
and get patient consent for that because
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility of tracing a back
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
of a patient when you have truly
 
00:56:20.809 --> 00:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
de-identified data it's truly protecting
 
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
the patient identity
 
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.220 align:start position:0%
is that what I'm hearing
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm putting limited data sets aside
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
because that's another can of worms but
 
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.569 align:start position:0%
because that's another can of worms but
the

00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:33.710 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
yes the the role of de-identified data
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
is that it cannot be linked to any
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
specific person and the reason for that
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
is because we have not obtained consent
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
from that person so the process because
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have consent the process we go
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
through is to completely strip the data
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that it's not identifiable
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
identifiable to any individual person
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then we use that information to do
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
our research
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
so to to link de-identified data to a
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
consent process really undermines the
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
role of de-identified data in the
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
research process the reason it exists is
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
because it's not a consensible situation
 
00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:12.230 align:start position:0%
because it's not a consensible situation
so

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
if we have consent we would use more
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
expansive data we would not use this
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive form so linking consent to
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
de-identify data actually becomes more
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
constraining right it basically makes it
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
impossible to use the the de-identified
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
data its role is when we can't obtain
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
consent so to add to that new
 
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:34.700 align:start position:0%
restriction on right
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
undermine the use of it what I'm what
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing here is there's a real
 
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
disconnect because
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
either you need to be able to use the
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
de-identified data or you know what what
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
we've said here all the way through is
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
whatever you get actual consent to is
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
fine so what I am hearing is for the
 
00:57:54.839 --> 00:57:56.089 align:start position:0%
fine so what I am hearing is for the
purpose

00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
of what we do with this bill now
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
is that my suggestion is that we present
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to 14 to the committee
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
if if we can do so with the unanimous
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation and give up on the
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
de-identified data for another day
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's that would be I think we
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
want to come out of this with unanimous
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
consent on what our process is we want
 
00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whatever we're doing
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
is something we all can get behind I do
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
think that this is important but I think
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
a conversation that is complex there's a
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
role of de-identified data as well just
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's less of an
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for data leaks too I
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
understand that they're rare but they do
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
happen so the more that you can
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
constrain the data set a it's less less
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
to Crunch which helps I spent too much
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
time in SAS and my econ courses but it
 
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
also there's benefits to it and there's
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
also detriments I I really would like to
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
see us agree to lines 3 through 14 and
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
get this out unanimous and then keep
 
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
I concur I think it's a good compromise
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
because the other
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
way to do this would be to retain the
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
full bill which would then delay
 
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
everything completely right by breaking
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
it apart this way we can get this part
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
through and we can still work over the
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
summer to introduce another bill next
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
year which would be the same time
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
Horizon if we actually retained it so I
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a good compromise where we
 
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.069 align:start position:0%
think it's a good compromise where we
can

00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
have this part of it done get through
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
consensus get it on the dock it get it
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
passed and then hopefully during the
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
summer time heads can come together
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and talk about how to come
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
up with another bill
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
I think that that's wonderful process
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
and I know we all have a driving fire
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
behind us because of some of our late
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
colleagues that felt very strongly about
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
this topic and not just our colleague
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
but we have friends and family members
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
who've experienced these diseases too so
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
just because it's not included in this
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't mean that it's not under
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
consideration we want to make sure that
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
we don't lose the the larger impact of
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
making sure that people can have access
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
to the right clinical trials now because
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the debate about the de-identified
 
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.390 align:start position:0%
of the debate about the de-identified
data

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
um would you like to to draft the
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
amendment we can have the amendment
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
drafted one through 14. I'll draft the
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
amendment 1 through 14. is there
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
anything folks want to change out see
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
any I think comments any word Smith I
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
think as you as you drafted it there I
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
think we were all pretty comfortable
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
with it okay yes
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
um and and my suggestion would be to put
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
all three names on the on the draft and
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
we can present it to the committee and
 
01:00:43.809 --> 01:00:43.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not to get to the other part
 
01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not to get to the other part
but

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
I just think there are too many moving
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
Parts there for us to and I don't want
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
to hold up I think we're all agreed we
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold up the other pieces
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again yes thank you and thank
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
you for your patience with us and I hope
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
you'll stay in good communication so as
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
we work on this we can make sure that
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
that we're moving towards the right
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
direction absolutely thank you again
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
we will have this committee Amendment
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
drafted in all three of our names so we
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
should be able to introduce that at our
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
next um get an executive session
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%

01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
have a work session on the 24th are you
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
available on the 24th the my my
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
understanding from the chair is
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
rescheduling something for the 24th okay
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
