00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
irregardless of what the Senate does
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
with us or the governor does with it um
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
we have a real mess with the budget in
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
terms of deficit and I think it's
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
important for the house to make a stand
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
on this and say whether and whether you
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
think cannabis is dangerous or you know
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be utilized it is being
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
utilized and people are going across the
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
borders to get it that's not going to
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
change and you know I think we need to
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
make a statement that this just m is
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
common sense and we need the
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
revenue uh I hear you but fortunately
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
the aspect of this bill is that the
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
first two years it's going to cost us 7
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
million and we won't get the revenue
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
until after the two years the revenue
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
well we'll still be in a mess so but so
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
basically you're actually making an
 
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
argument for why we don't want to pass
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
it now is because we don't have the the
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
room that's that's why it was such a
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
great committee room for me because
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
nobody we should go
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
under right right well let's this well
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
once once you know in terms of
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees knowing that this room is
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
available it made perfect sense for
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees but my light is on I'm
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
talking I'm
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I don't mind this is a
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we don't care right okay so
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh we were discussing uh what to do with
 
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.350 align:start position:0%
uh we were discussing uh what to do with
this

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill and um representative burrow was
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
saying how the how we need we need
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
revenue and this is clearly a revenue
 
00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.990 align:start position:0%
revenue and this is clearly a revenue
making

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
Bill uh and I pointed out that that that
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
in the next the first couple of years of
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
it enactment it's it's a negative
 
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
it enactment it's it's a negative
Revenue

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
because you got to have spend all that
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
money to yeah to get it up and running
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know I mean
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
I someone was there a fiscal note on the
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
back of the bill and how much did it how
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
much how much does it
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
microphone um FY 2026 7,
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
94,000 I'm good huh am I not good that I
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
pull that $7 million number out of there
 
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
pull that $7 million number out of there
we

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
know7 is an even 8
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
million the the general fund
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.870 align:start position:0%
million the the general fund
Appropriations

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
from that that yeah well that the
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation in terms of the actual you
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
know that that's the you know when it
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
says appropriation so
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically um and I assume this is an
 
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
theoretically um and I assume this is an
early

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
Bill no fiscal note only means that they
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
sent Ed to some Department to do a
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis it does not mean that
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to a second committee the
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
only chart the only chart that I
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually have the two charts that are
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the secret secret charts that the secret
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
squirrel that tells you whether it goes
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
to another committee or not
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it doesn't tell you which
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
committee he's going to in this case
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is an early Bill let me see three
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
is this is three oh I'm looking the
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
wrong one uh question
 
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.149 align:start position:0%
wrong one uh question
186

00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
186
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
186 yes this is an early
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
bill so we got to get this out question
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
we received an email with a a fiscal
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
note quick guide right and I don't see
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
there it doesn't say under appropriation
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
it says it on the here on the I don't
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
know does this replace what's in here or
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
is this an addition to what's
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what's the date on
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a date huh unless who
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
made who wrote it does
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't you see this no it was in your
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
email you know how many emails I
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
getday I don't know what to tell you I I
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if this replaces it or if
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's instead of or what's going on but
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the 7even million so I'm
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending jar that we just main
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill and that way we can see if our
 
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
the bill and that way we can see if our
fiscal

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
situation improves or not uh but at
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
least gives us some time to you know
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going to happen in
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
Senate and then have have them kill it
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
have it the Senate kill it and and then
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
and that means you can't have another
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill next
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
year cuz you've killed
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
the subject
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
matter so the Senate no no well I mean
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
we could pass another bill from the
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
house and then have the Senate kill it
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
again or actually the Senate would have
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
refused to take it it
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
just changes well you have to be
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
right I
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
think is a good bill I think this is the
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill that we lik the best from the last
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
session no we
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
don't I I'm I'm not agreeing with you on
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
that that I thought this was the best no
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was a was this bill was a
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
free-for-all this was this was this will
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
was allowed to it would allow to have
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana locations you know open up
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
so I think if I think if we know we know
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
what the environment is like I'm under
 
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.470 align:start position:0%
what the environment is like I'm under
no

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
disillusion oh sweet let's go on board
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
the you need your mic on sorry yeah uh
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
Ian that's what the Senate does they've
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
killed a bunch of stuff that that we
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
have sent to them um I mean they're
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for for most marijuana bills
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
dying right so I mean but that doesn't
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
mean we don't send bills that we think
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
are good if we don't think it's good
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
then we should use as working session to
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
try to make it better if if you really
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
do have issues with it but by and large
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
I think the house position should be we
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
think marijuana should be legalized
 
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:25.900 align:start position:0%
we've had that position
 
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.070 align:start position:0%
we've had that position
[Music]

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
for since before I've been here we've
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
passed a lot of things prior to that and
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the people of New Hampshire
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
want and if if the Senate and the
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
governor want to be responsible for not
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
passing and not becoming legal in this
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
state then that's on them but we don't
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
we aren't going to we shouldn't be
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
driven by what the governor or what the
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
Senate wants specifically the Senate I
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're two bodies we we get to
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
we get to decide what's best if they
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
think nothing is best and they're just
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
not going to take it up then that's on
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
them they can they can be accountable to
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
the voters but we should do what the
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
voters want and and we always have and I
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be dictated by
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
them so that's my stance I don't think
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
we should retain it well the reason I
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
recommend retaining is that we it's it's
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
another year that's closer to
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
election so then it's going to be much
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
more in the hearts and minds of you know
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the Senate will be you
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
know uh in you know close to the signing
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
up season next year MH so at least the
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
Senators will be be more higher profile
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
if they vote to they've been pretty
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
clear to me already privately and
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat publicly that they're not going
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
to take up anything that that I
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
understand that but I'm saying that's
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying so there all the more
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
reason not to send them a bill I mean I
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
I I you you want to send the message oh
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
yeah we we're agree and want to do that
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying is is that now you want
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat strategic about it in
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
terms of when when do we want to have
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
have the state conversation and debate
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
and argument over over the bill wouldn't
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
it be better to do it in the second year
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
when it's closer to election rather than
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
the first year uh which is right now
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's all come come by a and we all
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
want to you know get the you know the
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
first year everybody's going to you know
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
it's all about the budget and and and to
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
pass a bill that's going to cost $7
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
million I mean they'll they'll just kill
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
it on that issue representative walls
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair excuse
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
me I just wanted to point out that um
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
not everyone in the house is for this
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
bill we now have toen opposition in the
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
room at the moment yes and I will
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
continue to oppose this vehemently um
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
and I not to speak for the governor but
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
I believe the governor is against it
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
because she supports law enforcement and
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me again most of law enforcement
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
Community is against this um however I
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
did have a question regarding this
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
particular bill was there always
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
a cannabis commission that's um
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
page8 line
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
17 was that was that always part of the
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
original so actually the original
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
original issues always had a cannabis
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
commissions but that when we in 23 my my
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
thumb print was to throw it under the
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that we didn't want to
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
create a new commission that one
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
commission was good enough now it turns
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
out I not that I'm a rocket scientist
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
but if you watch what happened to the
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana Commission in
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's a
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
scandal every every
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
week another scandal's coming out so so
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
it's almost you know that again the idea
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
was that it would be far more efficient
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
economically if we just kept it within
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
one commission the state of Washington
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
did that they actually changed the name
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
of their liquor and add cannabis to its
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
title yes followup so so this bill as
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the ones previously which
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
were in League with or controlled by the
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission would wants to
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
establish its own separate commission is
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
that what I'm hearing okay correct yeah
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
so my thinking on that was and from
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
talking with a lot of the various
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
Advocates on this topic is is while we
 
00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.669 align:start position:0%
Advocates on this topic is is while we
have

00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
and it this isn't this certainly isn't a
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
hill I would die on if somebody wants to
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
change this we can change this but the
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
thinking is is liquor and cannabis are
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
different they're regulated substances
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
but they are different and so the way
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
the business Works would be different
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be regulated
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same and so uh because
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
that a a a separate commission with with
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
experts that have knowledge on the
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry versus uh just
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
assuming that the liquid commission
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
could step right in and and not have to
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
be brought up to speed they'd still have
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
to hire some sort of experts um and so I
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's in at some level
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
semantics if if the liquid commission is
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to be in charge of it they still
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
have to hire these sorts of experts who
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
actually understand the the space in a
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
way that they don't now because they
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
don't have any experience in it um and
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
so I just figured keep it separately
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
that that that would probably to me make
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
more sense but uh again not a hill I
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
would die on yeah because it's creating
 
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.950 align:start position:0%
would die on yeah because it's creating
bigger

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
government well I mean I would have to
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
say where where I I agree with you that
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
yes the bill will require um some
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
expertise in terms of the C you know
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
oversight however the key element of the
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is the enforcement of
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
the sale to underage people MH okay and
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
say and sail to a person who's uh is
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
indulged right you're not supposed to be
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
stoned when you go buy marijuana just
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
like we you you know if you're too drunk
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have alcohol so the
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
issue was that are you going to hire a
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
whole new enforcement division to
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
enforce that element that's where the
 
00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:20.919 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission was really where's the
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
cost saving um and not just you know the
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
thing um not just the the issue of you
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
know dealing with the intricacies of the
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and and and the problems of of
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
why cannabis is different than alcohol
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
and number one issue with what I've been
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
reading is the um
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
mold the Cannabis is has mold and and
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
they're and then some states are really
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
laxed about the testing California
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
evidently is very laxed about the
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
testing and and they're finding mold all
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
over the place and uh so
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
whereas so yes there are some elements
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
in which you're going to have to have
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
special specialist when it comes to
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
Canon but in terms of the actual
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing the uh no sale under
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
21 we we have a division for it and
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
actually this actually is going to come
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
up with the uh the bill that got is now
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
being withdrawn it's officially being
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and I basically I talked her
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
into withdrawing it because this is
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
about selling uh exercise U whatever the
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh what's the term the bill
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
um supplements right there were sub the
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
supplements and get down to she she was
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying well we passed it in New York and
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
I said so who's your enforcement agency
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
she said the Attorney General's office
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
and I go well our attorney general's
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
office is is interested only in our
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Law is only is only
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
restitution you know get your get your
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
money back okay not to enforce 21y old
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
21y old 18year old age so that was what
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
really who really enforces it so
 
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.470 align:start position:0%
really who really enforces it so
representa

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
spear over the past two years and then
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
this year we've heard a lot from The
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and when I first
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
started out I didn't really know who
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
they were or what they were but I've
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
gained a lot of respect for them and I
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the job that they do
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
and how well they do it and understand
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
what they're doing so the idea that we
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
put this under the Liquor Commission I I
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
I really think that's a good idea I
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem problem with
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the um some of the limitations that
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
we had in that last bill from the end of
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
last year was pretty Grim so that
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the same way but I
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
think that it under the Liquor
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
Commission I think it's the right thing
 
00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:42.870 align:start position:0%
Commission I think it's the right thing
to

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
do representative Burrows I I think the
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
the house again it's a different house
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
because the election but I think the
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
house last time was pretty clear that it
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
did not want the Liquor Commission to
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
oversee this no it was the it was the it
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much The Liquor Commission it
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
was the way that they had so many of
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
this and so many the LI the licenses was
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
limited to 16 I think it was more
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
personally I think I think there's was
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
may you may feel a mistake but I I
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
definitely think uh they people did not
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
want the leg commission overseeing it so
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
they were really thought it was a good
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
idea to go out and hire new
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
enforcers they not no but they didn't
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
know that issue that that's that's an
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
ins I think I I think the part that they
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
were concerned about is is the $8
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
million was going into the Liquor
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
Commission to right I think that's what
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was $8 million if I recall that was
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to expand their enforcement thing
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people were uncomfortable
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I this is not me my position
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm about to say but right
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people don't like the Liquor
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
Commission like whether that's fair or
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
not is a different point I'm just
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
telling I get a lot of feedback and
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
through that proc process when I took my
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
stance I I wasn't specifically fighting
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
against the Liquor Commission part of it
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
like I said that's not the hill I'm
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to die on I was far more concerned
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
about the licensing numbers but I I was
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
not I I was surprised at how many people
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
were very upset about the Liquor
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
Commission part of it and and I did say
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
that in one of my speeches that we're
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
going to be expanding this this
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:19.950 align:start position:0%
going to be expanding this this
unelected

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
unelected
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy um by giving them $8 million
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
initially um that was one of the spe was
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
one of the lines I said in my one of my
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
speak did you get the impression that
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
people understood what the Liquor
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
Commission does no it's it's like it's
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
anything you know it's big government
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
and people you know me let alone the
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill you know the whole about restaurant
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
you know getting getting rid of the
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement you know getting the
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
food the checking the food the whole
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
food requirements I mean all of this
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
people I mean let's face it it's a
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
Byzantine loss right it's it's a mother
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
mayi it's like zoning and and it's
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
people hate that you know that you can't
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
do anything without getting the bless
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
from from The Liquor Commission and
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
people are offended by that I I can
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
understand why people are I mean I've
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
I've heard it over the years that people
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
have issues with li what was the um
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh limit on Edibles what's in
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
what's in your bill I was trying to look
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
for it I couldn't find it the limit like
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
the THC yeah I don't know I don't recall
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
if I had that some reason I thought I
 
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.710 align:start position:0%
if I had that some reason I thought I
saw

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
saw
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.430 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.589 align:start position:0%
 
10

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
um so it is 10
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
then so is this going to be like Maine
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
where you're selling plants and seeds
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
and selling every anything and
 
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.470 align:start position:0%
and selling every anything and
everything

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's specifically cover
 
00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:54.349 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's specifically cover
selling

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
plants um I think C seeds are
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
not I think the seeds are fine I think
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
Joe have you read the whole thing
 
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.670 align:start position:0%
Joe have you read the whole thing
through

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
regulated right because they're not
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
Caesar you
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
can right you just don't know where they
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
come from but
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
is all our
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
people money and it's predicted that we
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
potential M on this way
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
high7 12 billion budget
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
every that's that's not a lot of money
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
to make tens of
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
forcades and you studied it you looked
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
at it Theiss was one the IDE first study
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
commission back uh that was when nobody
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
thought that their commission need to be
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
involved when they testified I
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
specifically asked them you know so I
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
said you do a great job you raise tons
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
of money for the state you sell you know
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
as much alcohol as you possibly can and
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
so if we want to sell as much marijuana
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
as possible charge they like you know
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's a business they're trying to sell
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
their usage down that's not happen in
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
the side of every Highway and people are
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
worried about being everywhere being too
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
strong you can buy brain alcohol the
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
side of almost every Highway in the
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
state yeah oh yeah so you know as far as
 
00:37:56.839 --> 00:37:58.190 align:start position:0%
state yeah oh yeah so you know as far as
regulation

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.510 align:start position:0%
regulation
and

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
en the number one thing they're doing is
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
keep do even we have 20 or 30 stores
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
first few years how many people you need
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
to enforce 20 stores to just check
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
out you need million
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
issues yeah but this this how many
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
stores that Maine have Maine's got like
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
enfor that's such a small
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
and and I think it's important to say uh
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
we just heard Maine I I don't want this
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
bill to be like tied in with Maine
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
because Maine is a really not a good
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
example like it's you know it's been
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
referred to by some of the people that
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to uh through the through
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
just process and like you know the
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
advocates for this as sort of the Wild
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
Wild West this is this is more similar
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
to like Vermont's bill um Main's bill is
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
particularly when you have like the
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
medical side like it's anybody can get a
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
license there's like no regulations on
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
it so those stores pop up people get
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
them confused um you
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
know as far as like they being an
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
enormous number of stores it's going to
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
take a while for that to happen because
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
no I just I found it here on page 35
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody can get a store yeah
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
anybody can be selling be have a have a
 
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
gas station and sell cannabis you can
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
you can sell yes so let me so this is
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
this is now if we're going to take that
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
number we know that right now when it
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
comes to who sells cigarettes in okay no
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
so it you anybody can have a store it's
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
not going to be gas station it's not a
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated store to cannabis the way this
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
is written is it well unless it's
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to say it has to be a
 
00:40:29.319 --> 00:40:31.270 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to say it has to be a
dedicated

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
store but I'm on page 35 they're shall
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
engage in serving taxable meals rented
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
rooms and renting Motor Vehicles or
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
license you so you C you there'll be one
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
one Li uh no more than three licenses
 
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.870 align:start position:0%
one Li uh no more than three licenses
per

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
person okay so where's
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't know where all the pages
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
are I just know the language
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
right well here here's the reason why
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting we retain the bill is
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
that theoretically just like the
 
00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:07.390 align:start position:0%
that theoretically just like the
marijuana

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
commission it goes through the
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill entirety and talks about every
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
element of the bill okay we don't have
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
time to do that right now right I mean
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
we could do this right this morning we
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
can try to do through it okay but we
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
have to have this bill out it it's an
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
early Bill okay so um we we have to have
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
it out by the six so I'm just saying is
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that it seems to me it makes more
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
sense to wait till come September and
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
then really go through the bill
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph by paragraph and decide you
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
know whether you know what the bill is
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do and what's to do so that we
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
all can speak you know intelligently
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
about what's in this
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill but if you want to just steamroll
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
it through you know it's fine but I I I
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
would guess I just the issue of having
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
this commission and have a separate
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
commission I mean that that's a killer
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
for me mean I I I I've always I was on
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
the position that it was that I wanted
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
to give it to the Liquor Commission
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
right from the Geto but yeah Ron spear
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
if we have to have a commission anyway
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on why that
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission is looked at in any way more
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
favorably what what commission oh excuse
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
me the the marijana commission that's in
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
here oh this Liquor Commission right
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
then the Liquor Commission would be okay
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
still this is a misnomer of that word
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
commission okay so what what this let's
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
call um the so-called commission that we
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
had that Jaren and I were both on that
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
was a chapter study that was a no no I'm
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
not talking about that the liquor study
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not talking about that
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right what I'm talking about is
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
this thing sets up a cannabis commission
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
correct versus The Liquor Commission
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
correct they're both government entities
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
correct that both going to have rules so
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
why would the Liquor Commission if we if
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
it's spun the right way be looked at any
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
more unfavorably than another commission
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we have but but this bill
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
specifically States they're creating a
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
new com marijuana commission why is
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
there an advantage to that I'm opposed
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
to it the argument would be that the
 
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
argument would be that that it would be
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
a dedicated thing focusing on this
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
unique industry it's a new industry and
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
if I think the reason why people are
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
conflating liquor and cannabis is
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
because they're both regulated
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
substances and so we think it's just oh
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
we're just regulating a regulated
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
substance and the idea is that well
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's still differences so if you're
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to hire people who have
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
expertise on all that stuff why can't we
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
just have one focus on it like why do we
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
but there's an infrastructure involved
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
and can and the Liquor Commission
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
handles tobacco without any problem and
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's a different substance alog
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
together yeah but this this this is this
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
is separate because there could to be
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
testing of the the purity of stuff all
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff and so well they
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't do the testing they require you to
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
send it out to a testing entity but
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
there all regulations they have to
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
regulate that tester to mean to make
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
sure that test testing entity is is
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
competent right so they have to regulate
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
all that so that's the idea of just
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
having them be able to focus on that
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's like anything when government
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
agencies get large
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
they become less effective right and so
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
making one agency bigger and bigger are
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
they going well first of all I don't
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree that that's the case
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
but they have the infrastructure and
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
know how to do the job but do they they
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
don't have they don't have any
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
experience with cannabis so I don't but
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
neither does anybody else right now and
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
regulate it and get in the state but but
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
certainly they they do have some people
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
who do right like they have the atcs
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
that already in existence right and
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's some Frameworks around
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
that so the people who are already have
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
some of their hands in the pot can come
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
in and help you know maybe be hired to
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
do something that's the thinking again
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to die in this hill this
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
is not that important to me but the idea
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
that like Liquor Commission is some sort
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
of like oh they got this figured out I
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
think is also a bit of a
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
misnomer that's my argument I'm not
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to die in this hill don't care
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
that much about it but you have an
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah this is a subcommittee so
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
separate

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
separate by the
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
way members and think
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
expert so there are many experts in the
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
field would be on The Advisory Board be
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
invting the small commission they'll be
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
more efficient U but if they have to
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
worry about enforcement they can
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
cooperate with any other state local
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
agency do any of that stuff commission
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to be contracted just brought in
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
for enforcement for each
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
easily but also the advisory board's a
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the commission
 
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:20.069 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the commission
too

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
so bu
 
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.750 align:start position:0%
so bu
reses

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
reses
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
bu there are
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
experience they just have to do the
 
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.510 align:start position:0%
experience they just have to do the
business

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
states I don't see a place for uh new
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
Futures on there so she'll be demanding
 
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.870 align:start position:0%
Futures on there so she'll be demanding
a

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
seat on the commission it'll be on the
 
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.470 align:start position:0%
seat on the commission it'll be on the
advisory

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee board sh okay this is theard
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
so where's the advisory committee yes
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
exactly H would be I'm looking at page
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
11 which is that must be the commission
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
itself no this is the advis
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's advisor right so I am looking the
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
right place yes I think she going be
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
looking for a seat she's going to be
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
looking for a seat she' be
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
under two experts in public health or
 
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:15.150 align:start position:0%
under two experts in public health or
something

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah same with
 
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.829 align:start position:0%
yeah same with
what

00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah this is free it's a freefor
 
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:31.710 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah this is free it's a freefor
all

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
so what I was going to say is that um I
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
think one of the concerns with the
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission was that they were
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to um give some of the big
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
businesses an edge up and getting
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
licenses because they were limited
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
licenses yeah and they were already I
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
mean you could see some of the
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
developers in New Hampshire and Beyond
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
already Belling up to the bar right to
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
get in right that was the that was the
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
heal that there was limited licenses and
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
that it was a it was think it was
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
Howard Howard said this is just going to
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
be a rich man sport yeah exactly yeah
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's why this wouldn't allow that and
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's why the house defeated
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
that version I think that was the for me
 
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
that was why but I think that's why it
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
was defeated yeah the limited licenses
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
what was they didn't like the LI
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
commission a lot of people didn't like
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
the LI commission the reason I took such
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
a Firm Stance was the the fixed license
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
yeah limited number limited
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
John

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
John
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I guess I just I you know
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
for for me I I would I would really need
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
bill mean why do we have all these
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
different license we have on page 13 we
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
have the annual licensing
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
fee adjusted inflation depending based
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
on the consumer product manufactur that
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
are not authorized to per bable
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
extraction is 10,000 for retail cannabis
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
store and cannabis product so they're
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
feed authorized to perform well all
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
extractions what is this what does this
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
all mean vol what is a volatile
 
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
all mean vol what is a volatile
extraction

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
volatile for tier okay so 250 for a tier
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
one cannabis cultivator
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
facility is it is this like a Nano Nano
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
cultivator yeah something small
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
basically yeah that's how you could
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
yeah this is okay just so you know the
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has yes it has a fair
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
amount of fees but every fee is related
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
to the nature of the underlying business
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
so in other words yes we have a pull P
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
pool room business so you have to have
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
10 pool tables okay we have a tennis
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
court license you got to have two tennis
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
courts so in terms of it's the the the
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
nature of the underlying provider not
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
the you know terms of the volume or you
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
know we actually the the one interesting
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
the volume difference is we actually uh
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh hurt we we make the volume sales you
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
know you always say the more volume you
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
buy the cheaper the price you should get
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
it at well not in New Hampshire what
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
comes the liquor because when it comes
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
to buying wine wine the grocery stores
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
have to pay more for the wine to put the
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
wine on their shelves than the small Mom
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pop convenience store and it's
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's a million dollar threshold so if
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
you have a certain if you do more than a
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of sale then then
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
down exactly
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
exactly it was
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
yep do we think do we think it's going
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
to be problematic that there are no
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
Republicans who are on this bill that's
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
only because the system failed not
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't okay it might have
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
been that way but they're not on here so
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
I just I'm asking whether it's going to
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
be problematic I think so I I would hope
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
not I mean Erica Leon is on board she
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
told me to put her on it and then like
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
you were supposed to be on it as well
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I never saw it it just this this OS
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
system just was screwed up do you I mean
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
do you know I mean are there other I
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
mean I love working with Erica I mean
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
are there people other people who you
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
think would be on board and working with
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
Erica on the other on the other side of
 
00:52:07.079 --> 00:52:08.430 align:start position:0%
Erica on the other on the other side of
the

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
aisle uh yeah I yeah I think so I mean I
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
I I think by and large there are certain
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
I mean that that party is more divided
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
right you guys are more divided so
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's the people who are very against
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
it and there's the more pre-at
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
Libertarians who are more Pro Pro it so
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think that that split isn't going to
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
sponsorship yeah it's a this is sub
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
commmittee it's a free-for all it's a
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
free-for all thank you it's a freefor
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
all um so I I know um last
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
term um a person representative who has
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
been trying to get cannabis passed but
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't like um the liquor commission or
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
anyone I mean they they just want to
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
grow do their thing not be regulated and
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
not be regulated and we've we've put
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
that through again and again but if
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
there's some way we can bring those
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
people in and you know try to get them
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
to support this or you know I can try to
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to some of these people to
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
maybe get on and have a conversation and
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
um try to do something about it I mean
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not trying to exclude
 
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
anybody uh literally this the system was
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
messed up that's the only reason just me
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
and Heath ended up on it I was supposed
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
to Anita uh dick Faxton he wanted to be
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
on it um Eric Leon like so there was a
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of people who wanted to be on it
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
and when I put them in just
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
happened whatever reason I don't know
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
what happened in the system apparently
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
it happened to other people too it
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't me I thought it was user error
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
but other people told me they had the
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
same problem so so I I I think if they
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
are interested
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
they get yeah yeah they can talk but
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
they can get up I mean I put in bills
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
that you know were one and pasted I was
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
um I we just have to reach out to those
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
people I think now and say Hey you know
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
are you supporting this and maybe have
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
everybody look at it in case they
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
haven't and um kind of if we need to
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
parse some things out sure yeah I'm fine
 
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.030 align:start position:0%
parse some things out sure yeah I'm fine
with

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
that well that's not my
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
nature my nature is is to go through it
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
and and make sure everything in it makes
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
sense but to just pass it and say okay
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
we'll if anybody has a problem you got
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
two years you got two years to fix it
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
because nothing is going to happen
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
actually I'm seen here it looks like
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
well that was your argument last time
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
right we going to have time to fix it a
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge was bad it I acknowledged that
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
yeah but but I also spent a lot of time
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
going through the bill paragraph by
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph right that's that's a famous
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
Pelosi quote we have to pass it so that
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
we can read it to see what's in
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
it no I mean people aren't I mean it's
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little frustrating that we're not
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
in a position to like do that now just
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
because of a short deadline or whatever
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
but um um well that's why I'm saying we
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
should retain it and then really do that
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
work how much time do we actually
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
have how much time we actually have to
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
go through this bill yeah okay well
 
00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
go through this bill yeah okay well
um

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
we uh are you going to go away on the
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
vacation okay so you you we do have that
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
week you could spend the whole week
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
working on going through the bill not me
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
but I will not be
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
around I will not be around so but in
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
myself uh why am I keep when's the data
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
has to be out by uh technically it has
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
to be out March
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
6 so that I was planning to schedule all
 
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.589 align:start position:0%
6 so that I was planning to schedule all
these

00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
bills um for March Tuesday March 4th if
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
I can find a
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
room if I can't find a room then we're
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
down to March I I could and maybe we
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
could do rep's hall or something and I
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
can you know try to do something and and
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
and I'd
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
get Paul to let me do it given that he
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
he wants to make sure all the blur
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
because the blurbs have got to get in
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
really quickly the the final day the
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
actual day is technically March 6 but
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
they've scheduled a session for March
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
6 doesn't make any sense to me but
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
that's what they did so um I could I we
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
could just say we're going to EXA
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
everything uh Wednesday
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
morning March
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
you that has it has to be if you're
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
going deliv we would have an amendment
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
and we would at that point we would be
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
voting on The the amend amended Bill and
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
and then recommend do you think that's
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
feasible Jared I mean from your
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
perspective worse for me if if if we
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
want to do it I'm not the one I'm not
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
the one who's going to be gone so I I
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
can I can make whatever work I mean do
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
you feel like you could pull together I
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
mean not just people I don't know what
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
the complaints are so yeah I I mean I'm
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
fine with the bill pretty much as is
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
nobody it seems like people just aren't
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk about this bill at this
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
time so if we just need time for people
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
to read through the bill and have some
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
more questions if I
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
mean that's what I'm saying I'm a little
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
frustrated just because we have we well
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
we're not in here talking about what we
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't like or how to make things better
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
it seems like we just aren't ready to
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill yet and that's fine
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
um then what we need to probably do is
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
have another session I don't know next
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
week or something if we're going to do
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
this to to just actually dig into it and
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
have people read through it yeah okay so
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
let's I'll get right to the point and I
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
it does this
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill allow any
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
convenience store to sell
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana that no I don't think so okay
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to have a you has to be a
 
00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:36.910 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to have a you has to be a
standalone

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
location okay can you tell me where that
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
is I don't know and and that's certainly
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
not the intent but I can double check
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
the language I'd have to dig through it
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
right I'll put that question down and I
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
can review
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
that so you're you seem to be afraid of
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
like 7-Eleven getting a we it's going
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
well right now like the big complaints
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
is these you know gas station um they
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
selling beer wine
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
cigarettes they used to sell pornography
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
but I guess they don't do that anymore
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
because everybody gets get get on the
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
internet but but um but it was you know
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
was those kind of fly by night you know
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
beer wine tobacco
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
places in all fairness to the sponsors
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
and the issue that
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
we to go through this again and come
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
back and see if we can make tweaks with
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
anything that we're not comfortable with
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
and move forward this it's gone on for
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
decades and decades yeah why you know I
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
just right and and I don't feel bad that
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
I won't be there because um at this
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
moment as long as you're insisting that
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to keep it under you know
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
create this new commission then I I I
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
can't I can't get behind this at all I'm
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
not insistent I didn't say that I was
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay well then that you would when you
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's up to you but at this point that I
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
mean to my to my thinking the number one
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
problem I have is in terms of my number
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
one complaint is this uh creating a new
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
commission that commission I want the El
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
commission to oversee it yeah um and
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of um assuming that
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
everything everything else has the
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
proper testing and the you know controls
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
mean I I I know that the only other
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
issue that the committee got bogged down
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
on which was the uh legalization and the
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
decriminalization and it looks like
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill right yeah right
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
right this yeah that's in here it's also
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
another bill which I don't know if it's
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
how it's going to come out of the
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
Justice committee but right that same
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
language there and then it's in here as
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
so um yeah so if you if you rewrite the
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill and and get rid of that commission
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
then I can get behind I'll I'll be
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill otherwise I'm I I
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill personally but like I say I'm going
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
to be I'm going to be gone you know may
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
next week next week we got to um we have
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh we got a
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
we got to get start we got to exact we
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
got to get exact all these all the bills
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
I want to do and then I we still have I
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
what I have left we have so we have 13
 
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.549 align:start position:0%
what I have left we have so we have 13
early

01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
bills that have to be done by by let's
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
say let's call it March 5th we'll have
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to be done March 5th that I was kind of
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
hoping to get some done next
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
week and then we haven't
 
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
week and then we haven't
heard

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
um 11 bills we have 11 bills we still we
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard yet and they have to
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
20th that's the remaining 11 bill that's
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
the remaining all the bills that we
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard yet let alone whether
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
we've done the subcommittees and really
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing with them all so
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
to me working this bill is a the huge
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
time consumer and and could take a lot
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
of lot of work um and we just don't
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
really have the time for it and that's
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
why I'm I'm suggesting that you we
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
retain it and then work on it in
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
September and and um and in that case we
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
have all the time in the world to to get
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
it done done
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
right I'd rather do it now I
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
mean the fall is my time to try to make
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
money and I get sucked into the last
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
commission that I was on and what do you
 
01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
mean sucked in you missed as many as I
 
01:02:55.279 --> 01:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
mean sucked in you missed as many as I
did

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
because I had to start working it's hard
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
for me to do the work of this job
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
effectively we don't get paid we all
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
know that right and I have to make money
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
somehow and I try to do as much working
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
as I can in the fall right last fall I
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
worked six jobs including this
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
and and so I would rather have my Falls
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
you rather just get sing start push it
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
through and have it have it di it's
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to die I know it's going to die
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm under No Illusion that we're going
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
to pass this I've known that since the
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
election results but okay that's not on
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
me that's on the people who choose not
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
to pass it and that's just one johned to
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
it you know the political
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
environment I think that is completely
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
no they're not going to suddenly like oh
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's an election year we now have seen
 
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.269 align:start position:0%
it's an election year we now have seen
the

01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.279 --> 01:03:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
light

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
well there's a big stretch there for a
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I I think I think we should
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
just pass it and and
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
if we can pass it we can try to come
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
back if when they kill it in the senate
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
or if by some miracle it makes it to the
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
governor's des and she vetos
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
it then we can debate whether or not to
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
do something next year but like this
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
bill's here now let's get it done now um
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
if there's concerns with respect to the
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I can certainly work
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
on that language to appease John's
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
concerns um I will confirm that this
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
nothing my vote is that important you
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
know you don't have to if you if you
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that you're consist people
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
but I would like you to support it
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
you're like an important person to
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
support this but I'm only one person
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're you you got to get oh
 
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
you're you you got to get oh
2011

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
2011 chairman question if if we
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
did if we did you know move it over to
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
the commission and Jared doesn't seem to
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
be too and you could get on board with
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
this do you still see it not having any
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
chance in the Senate oh the bill is dead
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
I agree with that the bill is dead in
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
any case I haveed this a long time ago
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't that's why I think we
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
need to startop even talking about that
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
like who cares what they say you're just
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
giving me a reason to vote no it's you
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
know okay having the commission but to
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
having to put the to put the Commission
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
in yes that that least that'll get me to
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
vote yes on the house side but in the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
end of the day the odds of this ever
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
going seen the light of day in the
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
think that's right we were the first St
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
great the highest number has always been
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
a model this done it before was majority
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
real close in fact the Democrats in my
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
County would
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
majority throwing that out blaming on
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
all Democrats obviously many Republicans
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
didn't sign on but it's passed time and
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
time again and we've studied it at nause
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
if people don't like it that's you know
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
one or two things about it that's right
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
so my vote doesn't matter right you
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
this no but the state model originally
 
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.269 align:start position:0%
this no but the state model originally
pass

01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
us no no no you're confused using with
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
when it came back from the Senate but
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
when we sent the original bill over he's
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
not talking about he was talking about
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
it some other time
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
okay and know what we got stuck with we
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
were told the only sign by the governor
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
that wer that well that's where that's
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
what yeah what I'm saying what gets
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
goofy here is is that the the house was
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
okay when we passed with the Liquor
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
Commission with the control with the
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
limited amount of stores they were okay
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
with that they voted it and was I think
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
it was pretty close to being veto proof
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
at with the vote but then when it got
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and the Senate
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
started adding back in all the things
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
that they wanted okay then at that point
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
the house members you know it lost by
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
four votes I mean they basically deleted
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
our language and put a new bill they
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
didn't delete that but the majority of
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
only that I did say that and so they
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
voted no and therefore then then it
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
no that just proves proves me right that
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
pastes my constituents that call me
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
email me whatever they they with the
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
cost of living these days they don't
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
want an income tax but they want pot so
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll have enough money right in
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
the state so I get a lot of that from
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
people um and I think this is kind of a
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
year that maybe we do get a little
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
momentum on that just my thoughts I've
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
had absolutely the opposite I have had
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
no one in my town and in surrounding
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
towns when I go visit that wants this
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
that wants
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis most of the people that contact
 
01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
it no no we have the
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
there social media and just they
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
actually smoke on a video or online
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
nobody really cares that level you know
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
there might be individuals who don't
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
want it but they don't have to smoke if
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
I feel like there's a what what is that
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
saying if if you want to if you want to
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
you want if you want to see if a a law
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
is bad enforce it strictly because then
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
you'll have people riots if they enforce
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
this strictly like at the federal level
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
this would become legal real quick
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
because people would be in uprag because
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
so many people would be in jail so many
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
people would be arrested we were just
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
talking about smoking in restaurants and
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
yet Parts smell and stench I
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere you can't no that's but we've
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't go there because that is the one
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
big issue people have is they say look
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
at the states that passed it right you
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
cannot go you can't go anywhere in
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
Colorado you can't go to what is that
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
red rock concert without you know you
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
you Red Rock you're going to be stoned
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
when you leave because everybody's
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
question I I would have to say i' have
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
to say I'm old enough to say that yes I
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
went to plenty of concerts that I didn't
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
mean they all the monkeys see Stone
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
monkeys I mean I I guess I guess the
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
question I went to Bruce Spring scen
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
concerts that people weren't smoking
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
pots the question is just enforcement do
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
we want to enforce it like it's it is
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
outlawed it's outlawed to smoke
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and in certain parks and
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
stuff too
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
um but people still do it so exactly but
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
those are enforc what's that smoking in
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
in you know like in Ry Beach that that
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
is enforced where right yeah so like
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
that so this could be enforced too is
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying yeah I mean whether or
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
not it gets enforced or not problem is
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the this law can't be enforced on its
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
own like we have to actually have people
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
have a will to do it and you
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
know well the libertarian me says you
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
know what let's just make it legal and
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
call it a day let people grow their own
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
I fine with home grow I would rather I
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
would I I would rather have people just
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
grow their own rather than having it
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
having people buy it because then then
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
because then you don't set up the
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy about you know the mold and
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
you don't have to set up in whatever
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
what people do the quality and do all
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
that that model John where's the
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill I I I I thought there was a bill
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
was that wasn't there a bill that that
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
just yes yes I think it's important to
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
is anybody do
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
it know he killed he killed our bill
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
last yeah he was against it he was
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
against the one last time the same one
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that I was against not not against the
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
first one
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
right I think it's important that we
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
that we uh limit the smoking in public
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
and and I say that only be and this does
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
so the idea of just letting everybody
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a free roll it has five times the
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
tar of a cigarette and for people who
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
have heart disease that's bad so I'm
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that we have to not let this go
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
and have a free-for all we have to have
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
be enforced but it already is it's
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
illegal in the state now and you could
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
smell marijuana everywhere
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah and I just think I just think I
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the thing like I
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
don't care and I'm just kind of pointing
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
out the reality of the way the world
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
works from my perspective anyways is I
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
think it's funny that we get all caught
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
up on public smoking people are public
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
smoking now it's illegal in the state
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and people are publicly smoking now so I
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
just think it's funny that like like
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
language matter no it is not publicly
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's illegal in restaurants
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
but you can stand on the side talking
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
about marijuana marijuana is legal
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
across the whole state and yet I I smell
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
people smoking it all the time like it's
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
just it's it's I think there's to to
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
your point everybody who wants to smoke
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
in the state is either going to Vermont
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts and buying it and
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
consuming it and then smoking it
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
publicly in New Hampshire and so it's
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
already illegal it's either it's already
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
those laws are not being enforced enough
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
that not smelling
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
it excuse me well I would have to say in
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
the defense of this this our current
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
situation is that um the people who are
 
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
smoking there are some okay but they're
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
very subtle about it they have you know
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of these little one hitter
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
things and they're trying to you know
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
trying to minimize people to smell it
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
and um and are certainly conscious of
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
not doing it in you know large public
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
places where a lot of people are and
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
which law enforcement standing right
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
there there MH okay so but
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
yes no matter what you do it's you're
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
never going to truly you know it's just
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement that but so that one of the
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
arguments for those who are opposed to
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana is that is that um the amount
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
of marijuana they smell now is going to
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
be a lot it's a lot less than once you
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
legalize it then even though you have
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
the statue and said you got the you got
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
the $100 penalty you know for the first
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
offense um it it it people become more
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
um arrogant about about not worrying
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
about getting and I not like I don't
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
really care funny thing is I don't even
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
consume marijuana so none of this really
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
matters me I just think we should stop
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
arresting people for it but the uh but
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
we just agree that nobody's getting
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
arrested now that's not true though like
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
they the New Hampshire's own data shows
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
that people get arrested every
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
year yeah yeah but no but right now law
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement the only time law
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforces it is when they
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
pull you over for speeding and the car
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
you know be open the door and and the
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
pillow smoke comes the the numbers show
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
that there are people still
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
being and um but I'm getting like like
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
people are like trolling me on on
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
Twitter for for this whole public
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
smoking thing I'm just like wow like
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
there's just no way to get everybody
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
happy so right that is
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
true so this is up to you what you want
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
to do you know with the bill I can make
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
these changes I'm recommend retaining it
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
if you guys don't want to retain it then
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to not retain it you can uh
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
you can uh go ahead and and schedule
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll put you in charge of the of
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and you can call the
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings and you can do
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys want to do and and do
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do and and see
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you can you can come back with
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
and and we'll we'll look for uh right
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
now we're time out
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
March March 5th assuming that I still
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
can't find a committee room for March
 
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.270 align:start position:0%
can't find a committee room for March
4th

01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
4th
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like all the other
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
committees why are the Committees so
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
hard to find this year um well I would
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
have to say that I know exactly why
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
because we had labor the labor in uh
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee room on Tuesdays
 
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.270 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee room on Tuesdays
last

01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
year but that committee doesn't that
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
right and then they added an extra
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee so in
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
well right you know theoretically it
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
should you know maybe get a little
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
better you know we move out but but at
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it's very annoying
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
Thursdays I could come how to bring the
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
committee act after session I can bring
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
the committee back but that that is not
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
idea sure yeah yeah I think we should
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
work on it and get it done and then not
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
the I can reach out to them and if
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
people have names right you have have
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever you want to do to
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
get you know but basically basically
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know um I would
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
recommend that you make sure whatever
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
you have that amendment is done by the
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
fourth and get it out to everybody you
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
know because you know if you're going to
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
throw a 36 page bill in front of me 38
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
40 page bill in front of me that I've
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
never seen I I I need a little chy to
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
but I would still argue that retaining
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
is the right
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
answer I'd say we should work on it and
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
sure we v on it on March or whatever day
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
comes after at that point folks don't
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
feel like we've got something worthwhile
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we can retain it well if when we
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
when when we have our EXA
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
session right we can to certainly go
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
around the conversation and see where
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
people are and then and basically the
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
choice would be uh to to either vote for
 
01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:23.709 align:start position:0%
choice would be uh to to either vote for
the

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
amendment or or vote vote to keep the
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
bill as in its current form or retain it
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
and that that options be open I'm just
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
telling you that I cannot vote for this
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill in its current
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
form and I
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
so all right so um for your note well
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
you got lots of notes on this one yeah
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
mess okay so we're gonna make a motion
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
or uh no we're going at this point uh
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're um
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
uh that we will have another
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
out and we'll but it it we will vote on
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
it come March 5th and I'm going to do
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying March 5th in the morning
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
rather than in the afternoon so if
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to try to solve things you
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
could have this
 
01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
could have this
room

01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
probably um on on March
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
4th I'll go lock it down
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
now yeah I'll talk to Robin to lock it
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
down now so that you can have this room
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
for that for March
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
4th that is a
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and then Wednesday morning we
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
got to exact and then we got to have we
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
got to exact the 13 early bills
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's the main bogey here and
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
you have the whole vacation week you
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
have all the time in the world to figure
 
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:11.430 align:start position:0%
have all the time in the world to figure
it

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
outar on the
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
fine that would be a subcommittee that
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
right that clock I got it to work for a
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
little bit and then it died again I
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
think it's just the batter's low I think
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
it's needs a new it needs a new batter
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
no exactly it got it got to 10:30 and
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%

there was any problems with the
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
relocation everybody was okay with that
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised they're not
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
here but I hate to hope I hope they're
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
not thinking they're upstairs but sorry
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%

problems with these changes in positions
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and refinement and did we save money
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
with it with this or was it just really
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
weird that it was an early bill but it
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
might go to Edna rather than Finance but
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know assuming you know it's

03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I'll tell you specifically what
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
here so in the original Bill there were
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
some definitions around stable coin
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
staking staking as a service those are
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
all removed they're not relevant with
 
03:27:32.239 --> 03:27:33.229 align:start position:0%
all removed they're not relevant with
these

03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
changes uh Roman numeral
 
03:27:40.269 --> 03:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
2 there was a reference to stable coins
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
it said end stable coins from the
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
general fund so that's that's been uh
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
stricken from the
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill in the old version there was a
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 that said the state
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
treasur may engage in lending or staking
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
of qualified digital assets that's been
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
removed so we we took all those
 
03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:00.189 align:start position:0%
removed so we we took all those
references

03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
references
 
03:28:03.429 --> 03:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
out and then the
 
03:28:05.990 --> 03:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
main the main change to the substance of
 
03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:06.630 align:start position:0%
main the main change to the substance of
the

03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill Roman numeral 3 it used to say not
 
03:28:12.870 --> 03:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
invest more than 10% so we cut that down
 
03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
and so we had a a zoom meeting with the
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
state treasurer representative Spears
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative M and myself and we went
 
03:28:24.750 --> 03:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
over uh represent of Spears had a
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
question about should the general fund
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
be taken out and the treasure seemed to
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
indicate that that's okay to leave in
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
and my my general sense was she's not
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
looking to urgently utilize this but
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
would like to have it at in the
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
toolbox and and she seemed you know open
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
to that that was my impression
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah the other impression that I got
 
03:28:56.070 --> 03:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
also was that this is an enabling kind
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
of thing she's going to do what she has
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
to do yeah right and so it isn't like
 
03:29:04.590 --> 03:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
we're forcing anybody to do anything it
 
03:29:07.389 --> 03:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
just gives her a little more ammunition
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
to work with which she may not do right
 
03:29:09.359 --> 03:29:16.389 align:start position:0%
to work with which she may not do right
away

03:29:16.389 --> 03:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
my my comment was that again this is
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
totally inappropriate for many of things
 
03:29:24.150 --> 03:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
she does this is not short-term money
 
03:29:26.349 --> 03:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
this is really long-term money a place
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
for it might be in the state pension
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
plan for example um I don't know that we
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
specifically mention that in here
 
03:29:36.990 --> 03:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
Keith no I would be up to their discuss
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
yeah but so I mean nobody's going to go
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
out and buy a bunch of Bitcoin in the uh
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the payroll fund for sure yeah she
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
said she she and her board of directors
 
03:29:50.189 --> 03:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
are going to make those decisions we're
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
not going to we're not forcing her to
 
03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
make any decisions she and her board of
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
directors make those decisions as to
 
03:30:03.469 --> 03:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
goes I just
 
03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
got well I just have a c question for
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
Keith so so Keith actually uh Anita and
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
I were just talking about she mentioned
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
stable fund and I said that f yeah
 
03:30:19.590 --> 03:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
stable coin I said that's not exactly
 
03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
what president Trump is talking about
 
03:30:26.590 --> 03:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
he's talking about basically having uh
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
putting somewh of a safety net among
 
03:30:33.150 --> 03:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
crypto um that scares the hell out of me
 
03:30:34.990 --> 03:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you mean St safety
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
net um are we talking about this bill
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
anymore well I just it it's relation to
 
03:30:41.950 --> 03:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
crypto and I want to make sure that
 
03:30:44.429 --> 03:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going in that direction that
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
in other words he would you know for
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
example uh you go on you buy a CD you've
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
got uh FDIC coverage we have no coverage
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
on stocks we have no coverage on bonds
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
but from what I understand he's talking
 
03:31:02.830 --> 03:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
about some sort of a a backup a dollar
 
03:31:05.950 --> 03:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
backup to bitcoin which I think is crazy
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't I haven't heard that okay
 
03:31:09.630 --> 03:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
information what I what I have heard is
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a commission there's a
 
03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:13.710 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a commission there's a
new

03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
cryptar uh in the entire Administration
 
03:31:19.710 --> 03:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
is pretty much crypto-friendly from top
 
03:31:22.630 --> 03:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
to bottom it's a a whole it is a radical
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
sea change that's just happen and the
 
03:31:28.510 --> 03:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
commission is tasked with their first
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
their first uh task from the president
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
is to look into creating a reserve a
 
03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
strategic reserve of Bitcoin and
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
potentially other digital assets that's
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
not going to necessarily back up the
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollar it would just
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
be uh the the US government having a
 
03:31:47.550 --> 03:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
stake in you know that that scarce
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
resource right that that's fine but not
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
that's not the way I sort of interpret
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
it that's why I was asking
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
you there is separate there is separate
 
03:31:59.070 --> 03:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
stable coin legislation from the federal
 
03:32:01.870 --> 03:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
level and that's it's really a dollar
 
03:32:05.070 --> 03:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
backed digital token it's one you know
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's pegged to the the value of the
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
dollar and that's that's sort of stable
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
token I think the federal government
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
already has about 15 billion in Bitcoin
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
already 200,000 200
 
03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
um they They seized 200,000 from various
 
03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
Bad actors and they have at least
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
200,000 oh I I was looking the other day
 
03:32:28.269 --> 03:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
and I think they've got closer to 15
 
03:32:31.150 --> 03:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
billion they did sell off some yeah they
 
03:32:34.349 --> 03:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
have 19 billion 19 billion so okay
 
03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
they're on their way to making a reserve
 
03:32:40.110 --> 03:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
so but that's not this bill so that's
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
not this bill the stable
 
03:32:47.469 --> 03:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
token was part of this bill and and that
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be like as transactions move to
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
stable tokens you can take your stable
 
03:32:55.550 --> 03:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
tokens and you can stake them sort of
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
like interest bearing we talked about
 
03:32:59.950 --> 03:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
staking before and there there whole
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a whole industry built growing
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
up around that I don't think it's
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
probably too far down the path for this
 
03:33:18.030 --> 03:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.269 --> 03:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else to say the
 
03:33:22.269 --> 03:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
treasurer seemed to think it was okay we
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
it got paired down to what we all agreed
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
to we chatted for I don't know half an
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
hour maybe longer what if there's a
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
different doesn't make any difference
 
03:33:32.910 --> 03:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
they have a board of directors they have
 
03:33:34.189 --> 03:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
to answer to and they have to keep us
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
certain they all get fired like they did
 
03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:39.229 align:start position:0%
certain they all get fired like they did
in

03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
DC this is not a mandate to to buy
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
anything no I understand I understand
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just enabling okay no I just
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
worried about it'll be a cold day in
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hell before she actually I know she's
 
03:33:52.349 --> 03:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
not going to be she won't be around if
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
they win
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
the look this is this Administration
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to happen anyway so it
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
gives credibility to it but say this the
 
03:34:03.670 --> 03:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
Cy Hampshire is willing to consider to
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
put it in its portfolio
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't know I just don't want I
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
always thought I always had a problem
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
with crypto because I kept I was like
 
03:34:13.110 --> 03:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
back from Superman you know it's like
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
crypto to me that's right that's right
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's not a they don't know
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
the wrong they just ch the wrong the
 
03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
wrong word for me but Cas never but
 
03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
would have thought of that cry
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
cryptography cryptography that's short
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there was a good reason for
 
03:34:34.750 --> 03:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
it so no you know this is just we you
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
another tool in the
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
toolbox um and you know we can say that
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
that we we have that capability
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and but I don't expect this to happen
 
03:34:48.750 --> 03:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
anytime soon that's what she said she
 
03:34:50.910 --> 03:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
said yes I appreciate it and yes it's
 
03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
nice to have there but it's probably not
 
03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen tomorrow or maybe even
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
the next day she did say that a lot of
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
her colleagues around the country were
 
03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
talking about it well that's the whole
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
thing they're all talking about it so
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
you you don't want you don't want to
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
ever feel that you're you've handicapped
 
03:35:08.239 --> 03:35:09.150 align:start position:0%
ever feel that you're you've handicapped
the

03:35:09.150 --> 03:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
treasure if there's something that that
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
that is it's something that they should
 
03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
get involved in
 
03:35:19.229 --> 03:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
so I think that we should just kind of
 
03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
vote on it so ready for put someone in
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
the audience representative Ammon second
 
03:35:27.070 --> 03:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
spear moves ought to pass on amendment
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%

03:35:50.469 --> 03:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
no no not the amendment I'm looking
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
at the amendment I'm looking at is
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
0138 oh I'm sorry yes go ahead sir
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself yeah Josh hips
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
attorney at the New Hampshire banking
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
Department we had fielded a question at
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
the last meeting of this regarding what
 
03:36:06.189 --> 03:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Banks would be allowed to
 
03:36:08.189 --> 03:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
have on their balance sheet and I wanted
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
to provide a little more color to our
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
answer on that hempshire does not at
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
this moment have a positive or negative
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
regime yeah it's really close yeah I
 
03:36:21.550 --> 03:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
have a positive or negative regime
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
regarding cryptocurrency or this type
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
assets statutorily defined we've not
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
taken a position on that what is
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
happening right now is the FDIC has
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically said no banks can't custody on
 
03:36:36.269 --> 03:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
their balance sheet these type of assets
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire itself does not
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit that and moving forward if we
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
begin to have this sort of regime we
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
would revisit that we would likely be
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
willing to Embrace that as a department
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the industry as a
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
whole I imagine the industry will also
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
probably be interested in it but as a
 
03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
department we have not taken any
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
position on this and so we basically
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
we're at the mercy of the FDIC because
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
the FDIC provides the insurance for
 
03:37:02.510 --> 03:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
banks and so the banks basically cowed
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
what the FDIC wants them to
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
have so the bank commissioner has a seat
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
on the treasur board doesn't she that's
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
a good
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
question I
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
believe so the question is if the FDIC
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
would say no no then unfortunately she
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
might be compelled to have to then vot
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
the F if there was the treasure right
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
what the FDIC defines as a safe asset is
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat the tail that Wags The Dog and
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
so basically if the FDIC says no we do
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
not view this as a safe asset regardless
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
of what we at a state level might say
 
03:37:43.189 --> 03:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with because they
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
provide the insurance the banks aren't
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to custody those assets if the
 
03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
FDIC changes as it looks like they might
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
then we basically will have we will need
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
to revisit our statutes but our statutes
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
are silent at the moment regarding
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency but we don't have any
 
03:38:04.750 --> 03:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
place uh Josh hips and attorney at the
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
banking Department yeah how how do you
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%

Forever okay the the likely uh use of
 
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
this would be an ETF product which would
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
be like a Fidelity or Black Rock product
 
03:38:36.670 --> 03:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
and then they would custody it just be
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
basically buying the asset on the stock
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
exchange you know yeah and the technical
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%

had oh still the same one
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay so you're you're rewriting the
 
03:41:43.229 --> 03:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
okay so now actually down here we write
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.120 --> 03:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
am is
 
03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:25.630 align:start position:0%
am is
AD

03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
ad

03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so you're technically that was
 
03:42:42.269 --> 03:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
there so you didn't need to do that so
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so you just checked this part
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
oh so you don't have to move it that's
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
exactly once you've done that then
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
next we will but it's we want to wait
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
that that that clock's a couple minutes
 
03:43:23.710 --> 03:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
fast that clock is useless yeah it's
 
03:43:26.149 --> 03:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
142 no I didn't stop and buy a new
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
clock but this hasn't been in my
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee room in a very long
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%

not no she's
 
03:45:49.680 --> 03:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
not no she's
not

03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
go okay so it this is the one that says
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
build number with no
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
the no this is this is this is
 
03:46:52.479 --> 03:46:55.750 align:start position:0%
the no this is this is this is
just

03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
work working copy as
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
amended well it will hopefully will be
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.510 --> 03:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.660 --> 03:47:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.670 --> 03:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
14 right we're
 
03:47:45.630 --> 03:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
ready okay
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
all right so walk us through all right
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh colleagues for letting me
 
03:47:55.590 --> 03:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
walk you through this um the one thing I
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
do want to mention I sent an email
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
forwarded an email from Municipal
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
Association so the CH the changes that
 
03:48:04.349 --> 03:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
you see there some of those are
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
from uh their comments
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
on it's Roman numeral
 
03:48:15.560 --> 03:48:17.790 align:start position:0%
on it's Roman numeral
three

03:48:17.790 --> 03:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:48:22.910 --> 03:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
V3 I think the page number still work
 
03:48:28.910 --> 03:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
page three right okay so page three line
 
03:48:31.630 --> 03:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
30 it was where it starts go Carrie have
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
you seen all the
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:40.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:48:40.349 --> 03:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
good okay so we get through the
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
definition section
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
then then when we in page three line 13
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's where we start with the actual
 
03:48:55.349 --> 03:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
statute that's right so we had an
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
extensive hearing on this um there were
 
03:49:00.149 --> 03:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee but there W
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
there were
 
03:49:05.149 --> 03:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
no people testifying against the bill
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
during the hearing so I mean whether
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's notable or not I'm not sure
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
but so there's a definition
 
03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:18.030 align:start position:0%
but so there's a definition
section

03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the infrastructure to run blockchain
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
protected so that talks
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
mine I'm sorry before that it's uh
 
03:49:34.110 --> 03:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
holding the use of private digital
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
currency so it's just a a Prohibition on
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
Prohibition the self the self- custody
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
portion is
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
important okay but I'm just I'm I'm
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
ready any person should be allowed to
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
engage in home the IND complies with all
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
local noise ordinances so right out of
 
03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
local noise ordinances so right out of
the

03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
block excuse me expression out of the
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
block um right the GetGo that the the
 
03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
focus is on the noise the theoretical
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
noise of
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
blockchain is that what I
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
and and just help me make sure I
 
03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
noise isn't anything much more than the
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
air conditioners or whatever the cooling
 
03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
for the make computers do big fans
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
mainly yeah if that's all it's about
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's so the chillers yeah chill right
 
03:50:34.870 --> 03:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
the chips get hot and no you said
 
03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:36.070 align:start position:0%
the chips get hot and no you said
because

03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
my uh uh my daughter she she works for
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
Schneider Electric which is uh where
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
they used to say the GE of France
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
and their whole focus on the computer
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
technology is the the racks and keeping
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
the racks cool it's all about the
 
03:50:58.510 --> 03:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
chilling okay so so we're we're
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
identifying in paragraph one that the
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
issue is that somebody might have
 
03:51:07.510 --> 03:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
complaints about the chillers so what
 
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
what it's saying is they must comply
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
with local any local whatever local
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
noise ordinances related so whatever the
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
decibel of the community pass the decb
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
right and there is a Chicken and the Egg
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem there because you know the
 
03:51:27.630 --> 03:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
community might not pass it until there
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
is a noisy operation but that would
 
03:51:33.790 --> 03:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
apply to anything right that would point
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
that the person who was doing it would
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
be grandfathered and that any new
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
ones couldn't have happened right I
 
03:51:45.550 --> 03:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
mean okay I looked up the noise
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances in uh
 
03:51:52.030 --> 03:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
nsha good place to start the noise
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances there do not do a decibel
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
thing okay what do they do they say no
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
loud radios no loud televisions no boom
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
boxes and no uh and and a sound created
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
in a building can't be heard 50 ft from
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
the building oh so this so now let me
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
get to this this law was written
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how many years ago
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
back probably when televisions were
 
03:52:18.960 --> 03:52:21.070 align:start position:0%
back probably when televisions were
invented

03:52:21.070 --> 03:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
invented
 
03:52:23.550 --> 03:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
1947 problem we
 
03:52:27.670 --> 03:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
have is that we have four huge apartment
 
03:52:30.630 --> 03:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
buildings in in uh nashille with
 
03:52:31.950 --> 03:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people living in those
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
apartment hundreds of Apartments we also
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
have multiple many multiple four family
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
units on one acre of a piece of land one
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry one eigh of an acre which
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
means 50 ft doesn't mean anything small
 
03:52:52.149 --> 03:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
thing yeah very very small crammed in 50
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
50 50 ft don't mean anything tripple
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
Decker yeah it's it's really kind of
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
crowded over
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
there now I looked up to see if this was
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
a problem anywhere and apparently it is
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
it is turning out to be a problem in the
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
fact that in know let's say you have a
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
four family building which we have lots
 
03:53:12.399 --> 03:53:14.590 align:start position:0%
four family building which we have lots
of

03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:53:16.510 --> 03:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
one person can be using a lot of the
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
electricity can be generating a lot of
 
03:53:20.910 --> 03:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
noise from air conditionings all that
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so there's a company
 
03:53:24.429 --> 03:53:24.439 align:start position:0%
called decentral and what they
 
03:53:27.790 --> 03:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
specialize in is making uh
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
components that sound proof the
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
apartment or or or make sound baffling
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
energy control so that your computers
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
can only come on at night or whenever
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
you schedule them and to Supply Air
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
Conditioning if the problem wasn't
 
03:53:46.950 --> 03:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
existing in an apartment building then
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
these guys wouldn't be making any money
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
cuz they're selling this stuff and
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing very well so my cons my
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
feeling about this is right now we don't
 
03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
have we have specific law against TV
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
sets and a specific law against radio we
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
could very easily in the future possibly
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
end up with somebody who saying we got
 
03:54:08.830 --> 03:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
to Outlaw this stuff not not Outlaw the
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
not Outlaw the residential mining so
 
03:54:13.950 --> 03:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
much as you better put some baffling in
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
and you better to have some energy
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
controls such that you don't take down
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
the electricity for the entire little
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
complex that you're in so we don't know
 
03:54:23.309 --> 03:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
future and I don't think we should tie
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
our hands right now and say no right now
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're free to do whatever you want you
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
can do whatever you want nobody's done
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
it yet that it's noticeable so my
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
feeling is I think we got to leave
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves open that someday
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
somebody apparently this has become a
 
03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
hobby that companies are making money
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
are you saying to wait till it comes the
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
prom yeah because we don't know what it
 
03:54:45.870 --> 03:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
looks like we don't know what the
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
problem looks like and I'm worried about
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings and these four these
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
small multif family homes all cramped in
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
together and one on 1 E of an
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
acre so I think we have to make some
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
kind of a a thing and say well let's
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's see if they have a problem we
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem right now but maybe
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
we will can just a thought I I think
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
what you said uh Mr chairman was it that
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
if something was done today it would be
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
grandfathered if a new ordinance came in
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
correct why don't we remove that
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
grandfathering that would see you can't
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't remove grand grand
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
the whole point of grandfathering is
 
03:55:28.830 --> 03:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
that if you you did something you were
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the current laws at
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
the time when you did something well
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay so it can't be and so you can't
 
03:55:38.590 --> 03:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
come back and say oh well never
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
mind believe me North Conway is dealing
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
with this right now when it comes to
 
03:55:45.630 --> 03:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
Vacation Rentals
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
but uh talk against car's point I again
 
03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
we don't know when this might happen and
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want to wait I think
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this this bill is
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
to put New Hampshire in a good position
 
03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to to be there when this stuff
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
really comes forward am I correct Keith
 
03:56:10.030 --> 03:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's the thinking is to that we're
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
like a safe haven for the yeah you know
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
that because the you a a local example
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
recent local example is the state of New
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
York put a whole moratorium on mining
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
they didn't let so it was discriminatory
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
against one industry Statewide and it
 
03:56:28.349 --> 03:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
sort of put a chilling effect on miners
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
setting up in New York so we we want to
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
say that that's not going to happen here
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know we're uh in addressing that
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
that particular issue there was a huge
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
mining operation set up on the Mohawk
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
River and it ended up using so much
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
electricity that they had to do
 
03:56:45.309 --> 03:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
something they they waited until it got
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the point where they had to do
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
something what I'm saying is we don't
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
need we don't want to put in a law that
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
says we can't do something in the future
 
03:56:57.389 --> 03:56:57.399 align:start position:0%
I can see not putting in a law right now
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
that says all right we're not going to
 
03:57:01.469 --> 03:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
allow any mining that's it that's crazy
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's crazy we don't have a law that
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
says anything like that but we don't
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
want to take away from our ourselves the
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
ability to put a law in the future that
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
says don't take down all of the
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
electricity in this little apartment or
 
03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:17.479 align:start position:0%
make a lot of rackets so nobody we're
 
03:57:19.229 --> 03:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
not talking about electricity here I
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
know we're not but that's part of this
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
little thing that they go along with for
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
instance I I'm I'm focusing on the noise
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
okay just then just look at the noise
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading right now if you can't
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
hear about electricity okay but if you
 
03:57:34.349 --> 03:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
can't sleep star starting a forest fire
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
and burning the whole town down because
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
too many trees around I wasn't even
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
talking about that I'm just saying that
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
people have issues with electricity high
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
tension that's another yeah we'll get to
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
that so let's let's let's think of this
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
another way it the issue here is um
 
03:57:57.870 --> 03:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
that a draw a potential
 
03:58:02.149 --> 03:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
drawback of digital mining is that it
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
has a sound problem that is a potential
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
problem okay
 
03:58:12.750 --> 03:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
so um and as much as as I would say that
 
03:58:12.760 --> 03:58:15.110 align:start position:0%
so um and as much as as I would say that
that

03:58:15.110 --> 03:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:18.149 --> 03:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.070 --> 03:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
more understanding of zoning than I ever
 
03:58:21.080 --> 03:58:21.990 align:start position:0%
more understanding of zoning than I ever
did

03:58:21.990 --> 03:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
before after going through with my
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
vacation rental business so what I'm
 
03:58:34.110 --> 03:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
seeing here is that uh especially right
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
now we're all talking you know and set
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
up a whole committee committed to now
 
03:58:41.990 --> 03:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell towns what they can
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
do zoning wise or can't do and that
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
struggle that zoning issue so what we're
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
looking at here is setting some ground
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
rules for towns or cities when it comes
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
to this kind of
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
activity and if the issue is really
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
sound if the issue is that is and it's
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
the chillers right the issue is the
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
chillers in my mind what we really want
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
to be doing I like the part
 
03:59:21.149 --> 03:59:21.159 align:start position:0%
here that um no State Lo there shall set
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
a specific limit on sound decibel
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
generated from asset other than mining
 
03:59:27.790 --> 03:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
other than limits set by a political
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
subdivision so the idea here is we're
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
giving direction to say is if somebody
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
wants to go into this business if
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to do digital
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
mining are we going to just say oh free
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
you go go anywhere you want in New
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're saying is that um
 
03:59:51.479 --> 03:59:52.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're saying is that um
our

03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
fear is that some town would Zone
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
against it and create some zoning
 
04:00:03.389 --> 04:00:03.399 align:start position:0%
regulation against it so what we want to
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
do is
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that um someone who opens one of
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
these businesses is uh is going to be
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable that they're that we the
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
state have have addressed the issue of
 
04:00:17.840 --> 04:00:18.670 align:start position:0%
state have have addressed the issue of
the

04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
noise of the chillers and say that you
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhood right other words
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
say that that that and that now that
 
04:00:34.990 --> 04:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's an anatha to me to start telling
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
people what you can and can't do but
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's just saying is that really where
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're going we're saying is if you're
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to put one of these things in you
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
got to put it in a place where it's
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
already going to we're assuming it's
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
going to be noisy it's it's an issue of
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
scale right so like I think Lisa or
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
represent post you have neighbors that
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
mine right I'm sorry yes we do you have
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
NE Neighbors in our town in your town is
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
there a noise problem I never hear it
 
04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
I've actually got in their house and I
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
don't hear it because they have it down
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the basement and it's a small scale
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
thing right so it's a matter of scale
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
like the industrial scale is like
 
04:01:11.309 --> 04:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
imagine like a Costco big chillers a
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
Costco that size all filed with they
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
could do their air conditioners yeah I I
 
04:01:17.670 --> 04:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
I I think we're talking
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
about talk about
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
noise in
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
the there are people that have happened
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
in other
 
04:01:30.429 --> 04:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
states where and in Texas is one of them
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
where in an apartment building they put
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
20 some odd computers in there and
 
04:01:36.670 --> 04:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
they're turning on the air conditioning
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't know until the noise
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
happened and it's just air conditioners
 
04:01:43.389 --> 04:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
and what they're saying what I what I
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
think we should be saying well nashar
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have a noise ordinance that
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
would even address this because the only
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
things they call out are are radios and
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
televisions because that's all that's
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
ever happened in an apartment up to now
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is if you decide to put
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
20 computers in your apartment building
 
04:02:01.870 --> 04:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
and God knows what people put in their
 
04:02:01.880 --> 04:02:03.269 align:start position:0%
and God knows what people put in their
apartment

04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
buildings if you're going to make a lot
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
of noise then you have to put baffling
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
in or and there's other things that go
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
along with that what we're saying right
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
now and it may not apply to anything
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
else because inside of an apartment
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
building we don't typically generate a
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
lot of noise other than TVs and TVs and
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh radios this is going to be the first
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
time that we're seeing home people do
 
04:02:29.910 --> 04:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
something in their apartments that they
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been doing before so my feeling
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
is we don't have a law against it now
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
let it go and if we run into a problem
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
we'll worry about it and address it when
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
it comes because then we'll know what it
 
04:02:44.830 --> 04:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
looks like and the answer May simply be
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to Outlaw it just
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
put in some
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
baffling we don't know how we're going
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
to do it I hear you and here's my
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
problem my problem is what we're deing
 
04:02:56.429 --> 04:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
right now with these zoning
 
04:02:56.439 --> 04:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
right now with these zoning
regulations

04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
okay this is totally zoning this bill is
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
everything about zoning and that is
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
that can
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
you have a computer in your home that's
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
doing this crash computer Computing okay
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
no no problem if you have couple
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
computers and you start having too many
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
computers and now and then let me put it
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
this way the battle over vacation rental
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
is that we're running a business we're
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
not just renting our house and it's that
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's the business element of it and so
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
in this case what this is talking about
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
is that yeah is is it just a hob to to
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
you know make
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
okay but the issue is H if it gets too
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
big it's too
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
much right in my case oh my God he's G
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
to have weddings there every night every
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
weekend okay and that's where I'm saying
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
the zoning balance this is a zoning
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue and that is what is appropriate
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
for that neighborhood if if somebody
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
just doing something in their basement
 
04:04:17.830 --> 04:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
and nobody can hear it nobody knows
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on there's no problem it's
 
04:04:24.269 --> 04:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden when they start scaling
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
up and before you know it they brought
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
they've got computers on other floors of
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
the house and before they know it the
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor uh you know is is
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
hearing all this noise that's going on
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
constantly then they then they'd have to
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
stop and then what they would do is they
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
would go to the zone board and say you
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
need a pass the zoning a to stop all
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
this noise
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
making okay so that's what I'm saying is
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
we got to think in terms of how are we
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is what is the where are we Drawing
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Line in terms of what is the
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of the activity and
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
happening hence that's why we have
 
04:05:09.279 --> 04:05:10.870 align:start position:0%
happening hence that's why we have
industrial

04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
industrial
 
04:05:14.349 --> 04:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
zones industrial zones was here's where
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.920 --> 04:05:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
noise

04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
noise
 
04:05:25.359 --> 04:05:27.269 align:start position:0%
noise
of

04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
and right then they're not making
 
04:05:32.149 --> 04:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're not exceeding the noise or
 
04:05:34.349 --> 04:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
ordinances once the baffling goes in
 
04:05:38.189 --> 04:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
right baffling is that's what baffles me
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
because because what you're saying is
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
that you've done something to solve the
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
problem okay but the next door neighbor
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
those how would I put it lightly might
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
be someone is it doesn't matter they
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
really just don't like these people
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing and they want
 
04:06:02.990 --> 04:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
to shut it down and they're going to
 
04:06:05.469 --> 04:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
make a complaint and now the
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
selectman are in the zoning officers in
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
an awkward position because he says it
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem that bad to me but the
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
neighbor say oh my God can't you hear
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
that noise or or maybe you should come
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
back here on when it's a moonless night
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and noise really carries you suggest
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to identify the
 
04:06:29.550 --> 04:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
problem and I'm trying to figure out
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to legislate for and
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
then figure out how's the best way to
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
fix that problem but I think this solves
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
the problem as we know it today it
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the problem might be
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
different in the future but that doesn't
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
mean we have to wait to the Future to
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
decide I I don't think I do not think
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to make a uh not pass this
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill because you know XYZ is going to
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
happen in the future that doesn't make
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
sense to me yeah I'm not big on
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
prophylactic legislation okay they're
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
trying to you know try to close the barn
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
door before the horse gets out but I'm
 
04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm interested intrigued by what
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is about is um
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
can the home Happy
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner do something and still not be
 
04:07:21.870 --> 04:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
a problem and and remember include
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
renters in that in big complex apartment
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
buildings okay and then versus we all
 
04:07:31.229 --> 04:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
agree that if they had just move this
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
operation over into the industrial zone
 
04:07:36.269 --> 04:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
or whatever the town oh that's certainly
 
04:07:38.189 --> 04:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
then there was no problem then there is
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
no problem so what we're trying to
 
04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
address I assume is the mom and pop shop
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the home the home business is that
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
really what the problem we trying to
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
address here it's just it's more than
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
that you can't use the if this passed
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
the a a municipality couldn't
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
use noise ordinances as a
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
directed as a methodology to try to shut
 
04:08:03.870 --> 04:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
them down they have to be treated the
 
04:08:06.750 --> 04:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
same as any other except that Nash was
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
has directed ones now that's the way
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
they do it they say radios and they say
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
televisions and so therefore or they
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
could easily add and they can easily add
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
add they could easily add uh in the
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
future uh if it becomes a problem
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
chilling chillers for conditioners and
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is going to try to
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
address is to tell them what they can or
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
can't add it's just to treat mining
 
04:08:36.030 --> 04:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
fairly and you know mining there is
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
mining happening in the state um now in
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
homes in homes and in you know the
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
proposed amended language is much
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
simpler from the original so just
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
realize a lot of that's crossed out and
 
04:08:48.720 --> 04:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
realize a lot of that's crossed out and
it's

04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:08:51.870 --> 04:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
Incorporated uh what the municipal
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
Association passed on this is what this
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
is their notes right this is from their
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
notes and and I emailed I forwarded
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
everybody that email I I got I got the
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
notes that one I that email I did read
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I did read that email yes you
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
did so if that if the municipal
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
Association is comfortable with this and
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
they're not here but if this is what
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
with okay not that I'm am a friend of
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association I am not we
 
04:09:24.670 --> 04:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
love the municipal
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
Association not that I they are and I on
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
the same level about about the
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
residential unit that the idea is that
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
this this is in the language in here is
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
enforceable in their minds for a town to
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
add to they zoning
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
regulations like I say all NASA has to
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
do is add on there yeah how that's
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
discriminating I don't see how that's
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
not discriminating if I call out now I
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
could I could uh talk about
 
04:10:01.389 --> 04:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
discriminating they just banned boom
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
boxes in their ordinance yeah they did
 
04:10:04.670 --> 04:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
think I think they're saying that so
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
that isn't that discriminatory yeah but
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
this says calling it out
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
specifically or maybe I think they could
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
write a law that that nothing could
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
would exceed the the decb or or the
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
sound of a boom box or anything else so
 
04:10:21.070 --> 04:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
this would have to comply within those
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
rules so whether it's it's the you know
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
the mining or but they haven't made
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
those laws yet and now you're telling
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
them they got to change and they don't
 
04:10:30.269 --> 04:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
know how to they don't know where they
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
going they ABS is a big city they're big
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
boys they can they can they can
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
certainly if let me put it this way I if
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
Association saw follow this language and
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
said this is workable which says set a
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
specific limit on sound decb generated
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
okay in your in your mind you're saying
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
is Well they don't have that yet okay
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
but they still have the limits if we
 
04:10:59.550 --> 04:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill I'll bet you you'll have it within
 
04:11:01.920 --> 04:11:05.189 align:start position:0%
bill I'll bet you you'll have it within
a

04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
year because we have set the guidelines
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
you don't know nashille no but that and
 
04:11:12.510 --> 04:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's and that's another is Nash runs
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
no it
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't no I you're looking at it the
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
other way around I I would every
 
04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can look at things from do
 
04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
two different directions that is true
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
and the problem I'm having is that we
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't have an issue right now we're
 
04:11:30.269 --> 04:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
putting in a
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
law when we don't know what it's going
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
to look like but we don't have an issue
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have an issue so why
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
I put in a law to create an issue okay
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
but let's say the issue happens tomorrow
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
let's say that that
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
tomorrow somebody in
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
Nashua in their basement not their
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
basement in the apartment next to mine
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the apartment next to yours which I
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't have okay suddenly puts this the
 
04:12:03.710 --> 04:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
mother of all air conditioners in their
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
window they put in this
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
big mother of an air conditioner and now
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's driving you nuts right and you're
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to call and you're going to call
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
the Nashua and and the and they're going
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
to say is well we don't Rec regulate
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
that's what they they're going to look
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
at that statute and say we never
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
regulated that right okay and you think
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
they're just going to say so too bad
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
constituent citizen of Nashua or they
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
04:12:40.670 --> 04:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
is you know you're right we probably
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
should have thatat guess you didn't see
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
any thing about the asphal
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
plant the only way that they got that
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
from happening was to go to go to
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
court now what was that a noise or or
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
smell that was pollution and everything
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
else it was in an industrial Jone it was
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
in an industrial Zone and they had no
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
laws against it like we don't have now
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if they did something the only way
 
04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
nashaa said was let's go to court that's
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the only way they could get anything to
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
change it wasn't anybody nicely sitting
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
there saying oh well this sounds
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
ridiculous let's go change it and what
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
was their basis of their court case what
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
was what did they had to be pollution
 
04:13:20.720 --> 04:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
was what did they had to be pollution
okay

04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so is that what we're going to have to
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
do this it I I no no we're opposite of
 
04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
each other now
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
around I don't see how what you what you
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
know putting in a law now for something
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
you don't know what it looks like I have
 
04:13:40.590 --> 04:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
to say is normally I'm not into
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
prophylactic legislation you know to try
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
to do it trying to Bar close the barer
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
before but that having the state say
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of time before anybody has passed
 
04:13:52.960 --> 04:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
ahead of time before anybody has passed
the

04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
zoning saying ahead of time this is what
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
you need to do you telling the I'm we're
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
by passing if we were to pass this
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
sentence set a specific limit on sound
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
decb generated from home digital asset
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
mining other than limit said I mean and
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
you don't even need to say home digital
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
assets but you can say setting sound
 
04:14:17.950 --> 04:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
limits on
 
04:14:22.030 --> 04:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
decimals generated for
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
including home digital asset
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
mining by the limits of a political
 
04:14:30.429 --> 04:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
subdivision that sounds better okay just
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
simply saying it's not we're not saying
 
04:14:34.229 --> 04:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's just digital asset it's it can be
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
anything that makes noise pollution we
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
are giving them advice that maybe you
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
want when you put it the way when you
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
put it the way you just said
 
04:14:44.359 --> 04:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
put it the way you just said
you

04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
happy I pull rabbits out of the Hat all
 
04:14:48.080 --> 04:14:48.950 align:start position:0%
happy I pull rabbits out of the Hat all
the

04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:51.309 --> 04:14:51.319 align:start position:0%
time they're they're mentioning let's
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
say televisions and radios in here they
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't mention bugles so I mean a guy can
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
get up on the roof of uh the building
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
and start blowing the the fugle and what
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
somebody would say wait a minute that's
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
making no more noise than you're louded
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
to because there more noise than than a
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
TV or radio makes this is covered by
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
that no it is not it is we'll have to go
 
04:15:18.269 --> 04:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
to court on oh no this wait a minute
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
wait a minute wait a minute which what
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
do you mean by this who is this I'm just
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
saying that this basically says you
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
can't feed the the local noise
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances that's what it says don't
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
both way yeah it wor both way can we
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
vote on this I I uh well we there's
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
still more this whole sentence has got
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
to be reworked but I'm open to reworking
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
it the whole the whole sentence is SE
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
everybody and and I I actually
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh agree with you that we should take
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat take the digital asset act
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
aspect out of this bill and be more like
 
04:15:52.640 --> 04:15:53.469 align:start position:0%
aspect out of this bill and be more like
a

04:15:53.469 --> 04:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
guidance okay and and normally I would
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
say this well let's should go to
 
04:15:59.229 --> 04:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
the municipal and County government but
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
we don't want to send it off to another
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee we we'll fix this on our own
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll get their blessing but I think
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
that it that if we just it's not about
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
digital asset it's about anybody who's
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
got a home business that might make a
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
lot of noise it doesn't have to be
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
business don't make it a business it
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
could be a hobby it's a it's a h home
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me home activity that makes too
 
04:16:26.030 --> 04:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
much damn noise that'd be fine I I would
 
04:16:28.349 --> 04:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
like to leave the word the term digital
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
Assets in there expand it including okay
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
including we going to postpone this then
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
or just we're still working we're
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
working the language only one so I know
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
so some of you weren't here for the this
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
morning so so basically um is this an
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
early bill or not uh what's the bill
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
what's the what is the bill number in
 
04:16:50.880 --> 04:16:54.389 align:start position:0%
what's the what is the bill number in
this

04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
639 okay an early bill means we have to
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
get out of committee early because it's
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to a second
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
commit what makes it an early bill it's
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note and no no it has nothing
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the fiscal no Oh I thought it
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
was okay I'll leave I'll leave my mic on
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
for this one okay an early bill
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
is that whoever is sitting in the
 
04:17:20.720 --> 04:17:23.070 align:start position:0%
is that whoever is sitting in the
speaker's

04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
speaker's
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
office and Paul Smith is usually in the
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
room and years ago used didn't even he
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
used to be just staffer so it could have
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
been just Aaron okay whoever's sitting
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
in that room they read the
 
04:17:39.070 --> 04:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill they're supposed to pay attention
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
to the rsas which sometimes I we couple
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
bills we've had back to the committee
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
because they weren't paying attention to
 
04:17:49.870 --> 04:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
the RSA but they are paying attention
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
that they look at that statute and then
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
say well which committee should get this
 
04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
bill and they go well this bill should
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
go to Commerce because it's dealing with
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
assets well this bill also
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
has and I hate to say it you know zoning
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
I mean they got
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties I mean to be honest I
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
have no idea what they do and how they
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
decide um it's supposed to be and and
 
04:18:28.349 --> 04:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
over my years I've had this conversation
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be they're looking at
 
04:18:30.520 --> 04:18:31.469 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be they're looking at
the

04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
rsas okay in this case you got you know
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
359 that well that I think that's us
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
anyways that's um consumer protection
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
but they they look at the penalties and
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
they'll say is all right this needs to
 
04:18:47.070 --> 04:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
go to two
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
committees has nothing to do with the
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note if it had an a appropriation
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
it absolutely the second committee would
 
04:18:55.920 --> 04:18:57.189 align:start position:0%
it absolutely the second committee would
be

04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
Finance but if it says FN FN simply
 
04:19:04.990 --> 04:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
means that that they sent it to at least
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
one or more departments to generate a
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but the only way you know
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to do a seconding committee
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
is that you have to have this little
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
secret secret report this Secret
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
Squirrel report that
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
only that only staff and chairman can
 
04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
secret it's it's not a secret anymore
 
04:19:37.630 --> 04:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
now right okay it is it is not it is it
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
is it is not obvious no it isn't it is
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
not obvious you just get yeah I know
 
04:19:47.149 --> 04:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
what this is going no it is not obvious
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as a chairman I have
 
04:19:53.309 --> 04:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
to uh take
 
04:19:53.319 --> 04:19:55.109 align:start position:0%
to uh take
my

04:19:55.109 --> 04:19:55.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
instructions and says this bill has to
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
go out early because it's going to a
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
second committee too bad okay too bad
 
04:20:06.750 --> 04:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
okay now the interesting part about that
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
is there have been times when the
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee gets it out early and then and
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
finance waves yeah we you seen that on
 
04:20:16.510 --> 04:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
the floor there we oh we don't we don't
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
need to take it after all okay so having
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
said that um this bill is supposed to go
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
to a second committee it might go to
 
04:20:26.670 --> 04:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal I don't know it doesn't matter
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
all I know is we have to vote this out
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
of committee on the 5th because the 6 is
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
a session day and we can't do it on the
 
04:20:40.510 --> 04:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
six so we have to do it on the 5th and
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh so we want to amend it we want to do
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to to make it it
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
comfortable for this committee Commerce
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable to send this bill forward
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could retain it and we
 
04:20:59.229 --> 04:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
would work on it in September it would
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
come out in January and delay okay so
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
the issue right now is for saying this
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
can be
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
fixed because what we're doing is we're
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
we're taking this the viice of the
 
04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipal Association not that you have
 
04:21:18.429 --> 04:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
any love spirit for them okay but that
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
we can at least say what we're really
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
care about is we don't we're not
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
labeling this an activity as a hobby
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
versus business or whatever it is but
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they do if the town wants to
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
limit what's going
 
04:21:37.389 --> 04:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
on using
 
04:21:37.399 --> 04:21:39.950 align:start position:0%
on using
decies

04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
decies
 
04:21:42.269 --> 04:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
said otherwise the town might not Zone
 
04:21:42.279 --> 04:21:43.670 align:start position:0%
said otherwise the town might not Zone
anything

04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
it just this is talking about how no
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
town can make it uh pick on them pick on
 
04:21:52.590 --> 04:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
that industry so what we want to just
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
rephrase it and rather than making a
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
picking on the industry is that that
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
that it's the sound is
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
certainly allowed to set decimal
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
limits but but that um and and including
 
04:22:11.309 --> 04:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
digital assets we're just setting some
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
ground rules but if they they want to
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
way how about some
 
04:22:27.109 --> 04:22:27.119 align:start position:0%
Scottish ppes
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we want to have in
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
there just rephrase that sentence to
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
similian sound
 
04:22:40.830 --> 04:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
decibels uh um from any noise including
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
house digital asset mining other than
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision so don't pick on anybody
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
else we okay with that could you repeat
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
that I'll type it in my set a specific
 
04:23:03.910 --> 04:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
limit on sound decimals generated from
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
noise from noise
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
including home digital asset and I think
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
you might want to drop the word home I
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
think that I was thinking the same thing
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
to lead the word home just say including
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining other than the
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
limits set by a political subdivision
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
set a specific limit on sound decimals
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
generated from any noise in in comma
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
including digital asset mining comma
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
other than the limits set by the
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision in any local noise
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
ordinances what's that yeah right any
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
just took out one word I okay we're
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
looking at you got it in front of
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah to right now it says set a
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
specific limit on sound decb generated
 
04:24:01.000 --> 04:24:05.070 align:start position:0%
specific limit on sound decb generated
from

04:24:05.070 --> 04:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
noise in comma
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.670 --> 04:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.109 --> 04:24:23.119 align:start position:0%
home right including
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
bugles all generated from noise well you
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
know I think that then setting the
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
limits set by a political subdivision
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
might like that sounds a little
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
confusing to me but so generated from
 
04:24:36.399 --> 04:24:38.309 align:start position:0%
confusing to me but so generated from
noise

04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
noise
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.670 --> 04:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
noise from the building to the outside
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
world that's where they set the limits
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
from the building outside
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
world where the problem comes in is
 
04:25:00.030 --> 04:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
inside of an apartment building it may
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
never get to the outside world but it's
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
driving everybody on that floor
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
insane so it's not
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
just the the building or whatever
 
04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
structure it's in it has to be it could
 
04:25:16.030 --> 04:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
be internal to the building because
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's multiple people but that would
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
be the limits set by a political
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision you could have a a which is
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
confusing I agree with you so um I I uh
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
we I need to let me work with uh the
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
municipal Association to get the a good
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
phrasing but that what you wanted to say
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
is we don't want a political Au we want
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors can I can I ask you a question
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
so if you're an apartment someone has
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
kids several kids and they put an air
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
conditioner in
 
04:25:55.630 --> 04:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
every window what's the uh when you set
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
up if you have enough computers you're
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
putting in multiple air condition and
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
internal it's a different kind of air
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
window get zoning zoning is from a
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision right but in an
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
apartment complex or condo complex
 
04:26:15.510 --> 04:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's other governance that happens
 
04:26:16.750 --> 04:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
they got their own rules they got their
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
own rules and that this this won't even
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
apply to that I'm I'm assuming that
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
phrase set by the political
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
subdivision is a zoning term I'm
 
04:26:28.590 --> 04:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that but we don't have any
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
zoning people
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
here can I call somebody the municipal
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
Association get their buns down here I I
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that's correct I think that
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
do you have his phone number in the
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
apartment you're going to have other
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
rules and I don't well
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
but yeah but you can't have Nashville go
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
and tell every apartment building what
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
they've got to have for rules internally
 
04:26:50.040 --> 04:26:58.790 align:start position:0%
they've got to have for rules internally
oh

04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:01.229 --> 04:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
internally well that's that's NASA's job
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
that Nas's
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
talk yeah we're talking about the zoning
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the zoning of the
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
town I would have to say with my limited
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
experience over the years zoning around
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
regulations around noise noise has been
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
is complicated it's not because most of
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
the time it's this one guy who who Who's
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
got this Hemi with with a very noisy
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
engine and has to hit his you know and
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
and do that so in this case what
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
concerns me about your concern is let's
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
say some guy's got a really old air
 
04:27:42.750 --> 04:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
conditioner that's got that
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
noise clicky noise okay and that clicky
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
noise is so loud that the next door
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
news I bet you it comes up all the time
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
and they just told the person tough
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
bananas buy him a new air conditioner
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
killing this we're killing this okay we
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
all need to know that that paragraph
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
needs some more that sentence needs some
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
work all
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
right maybe we should take a field trip
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
to one of these
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
places okay we're on to the next set all
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
right uh imposing requirement um that
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
does not equally apply to an industrial
 
04:28:27.229 --> 04:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
Zone properties we don't have a problem
 
04:28:29.790 --> 04:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.800 --> 04:28:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
right okay all right okay let me let me
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
repas it so you I know that youve read
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
this on so now I'm on page
 
04:28:48.189 --> 04:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
problem uh I guess or no agency May
 
04:28:59.790 --> 04:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
establish a rate schedule for digital
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
asset of money that creates a
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
discriminatory rates for digital asset
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's to do with electricity rates
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
electricity rates yeah
 
04:29:10.309 --> 04:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay okay you assume you don't have a
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
we're right now on line seven on page
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
four it's the new number where you um
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
you no no they won't do they they're
 
04:29:32.670 --> 04:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
highly regulated by the Public Utilities
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
Commission fine okay all right now we're
 
04:29:42.189 --> 04:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
on to V4 right to private keys
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay tell us about your problem with
 
04:29:44.640 --> 04:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
okay tell us about your problem with
private

04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
Keys it's an RSA but
 
04:30:06.990 --> 04:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
account there it
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
is it's RSA 595 did a Col
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
six and I read that RSA and what's in
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
here is tighter than that now ordinarily
 
04:30:23.790 --> 04:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
I would think that maybe we
 
04:30:27.870 --> 04:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't we don't know what or we should
 
04:30:31.469 --> 04:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
have something then I went and looked up
 
04:30:31.479 --> 04:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
have something then I went and looked up
my

04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
new investigation is found
 
04:30:36.760 --> 04:30:38.309 align:start position:0%
new investigation is found
spaning

04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
spaning
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
apparently crypto is now used
 
04:30:44.349 --> 04:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
extensively the porn
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
characterize you know what the
 
04:30:55.710 --> 04:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
internet's used for all kinds of
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
Nefarious things too right so let me
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
just get to my point
 
04:31:06.510 --> 04:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
my they use tokens to put in content and
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
they use a different set of tokens to
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
buy the
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
content where I have problem is if this
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
is what's going on in the regular world
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
you call porno the regular world it's on
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
the regular internet I you get oh oh the
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
tokens that let's say Microsoft has with
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
their games and these kids have byy they
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
get tokens and they win tokens do you
 
04:31:31.710 --> 04:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
think we're going to get into regulating
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
that no that's not the point that's not
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
the point the point is how far behind
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
are we I'm finding child point and so
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
the idea somebody uses a blockchain to
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
do illegal activities we need why do we
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
want a law that's tighter than what's
 
04:31:51.550 --> 04:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
already existing for bank
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
accounts in order to get information the
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
language of the bill says
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral 2 a court May compel
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure of private key only if the
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
party seeking compulsion demonstrates a
 
04:32:05.630 --> 04:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that the
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
information or acts of assault cannot
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
reasonably be attained by through other
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
means and that lack of disclosure will
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
lead to Ill rep able harm so when you're
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
talking about irreparable harm this has
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
compel this is this is more like having
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
cash in a safety deposit box like bank
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
account's a third party this this is not
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
involving third parties so I think we
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
should beting any
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
laws that make anything
 
04:32:43.119 --> 04:32:44.630 align:start position:0%
laws that make anything
any

04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
harder for them to investigate whatever
 
04:32:48.750 --> 04:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
illegal activities they need to
 
04:32:51.070 --> 04:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
investigate so what is what is the RSA
 
04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to that's already
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
have we have another seat over here for
 
04:33:05.230 --> 04:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
you what's that say
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
the you want to five 5 95 95
 
04:33:12.279 --> 04:33:13.390 align:start position:0%
the you want to five 5 95 95
d

04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
d
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
a colon six that's the in which they can
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
bank comp they can compel the bank to
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
comply this is compelling you to give up
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
a secret might just be in your mind
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
right give the account number well so
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
your public key would be similar to your
 
04:33:35.310 --> 04:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
account number it wouldn't allow them to
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
move the funds but it would allow to see
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
what where the funds are flowing right
 
04:33:42.750 --> 04:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
so I way I look at this is that it's
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
saying is no one should be compelled to
 
04:33:47.949 --> 04:33:47.959 align:start position:0%
give up information unless somebody's
 
04:33:49.709 --> 04:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
taken them to
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
court and the court says you got to you
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
got to show it you got to give us your
 
04:33:58.269 --> 04:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
your password and we have a and and so
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
therefore you just want this to this
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
right to private Keys refer to RSA 595
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
A6 or something like that okay no more
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive than that okay well we'll
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
consider it look into it just related to
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
that look into I mean this is
 
04:34:19.590 --> 04:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
about digital private Keys sorry I SC
 
04:34:21.629 --> 04:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
let me read
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
59 marvels of computers okay A6 this is
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh an officer of EX search warrant but
 
04:34:30.910 --> 04:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
for some other o men finds property or
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
empowered to take he shall seize and
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
safely keep them under direction of the
 
04:34:37.390 --> 04:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
Court yeah so this under under the
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
guidance of the
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
statute in other words that that
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
exemption that you're looking there for
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
part two you would just want to refer to
 
04:34:46.320 --> 04:34:47.029 align:start position:0%
part two you would just want to refer to
5

04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
5
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
9686 okay uh yeah oh good you know
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
something about this perfect that's what
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
I need more of so you know something
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
just quick comment on this
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes great all right and youran tell
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
everybody your name yes Ian huid here is
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
a volunteer board member of New
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire blockchain Council and just to
 
04:35:09.789 --> 04:35:09.799 align:start position:0%
clarify the the reason you would want
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
actually stronger protections for
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
private Keys than you would want for a
 
04:35:16.029 --> 04:35:16.039 align:start position:0%
bank account is a bank account is
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
controlled by responsible third party a
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
bank if someone compromises my bank
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
information you know they've got my
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
debit card number they've got my routing
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
number I can call the bank and they can
 
04:35:28.590 --> 04:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
bail me out potentially and and at least
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
greatly mitigate the harm whereas if
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
someone gets my private keys I'm done
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
that's it so there is a a tremendous
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
qualitative difference and that's at
 
04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
least the reason why you would argue
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
that private Keys Merit greater
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
protection because if they are
 
04:35:46.990 --> 04:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
compromised in some way you're just
 
04:35:49.390 --> 04:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
toast there's no you know Bank customer
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
support line that can come and help you
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about somebody getting
 
04:35:57.070 --> 04:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
compromised by Joe Frank walking down
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the street we're talking about a legal
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
case in which there is suspected illegal
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
activity and a court is involved right
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about just anybody
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
walking off the street and stealing
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's referring to the paragraph
 
04:36:12.029 --> 04:36:12.039 align:start position:0%
two court May compel disclosure of a
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
private key only if the party seeking
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
compulsion to demonstrates by clear and
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence the information or
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
access S can cannot be rained through
 
04:36:22.520 --> 04:36:23.709 align:start position:0%
access S can cannot be rained through
other

04:36:23.709 --> 04:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
means that's where I have the problem
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
other means means that now words the
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
state can get that information without
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
them I want it I like it to say that the
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
same thing is
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
whats the court shall impose appropriate
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
projection ensure the disclosures
 
04:36:41.150 --> 04:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
no the prevailing part's legitimate
 
04:36:41.160 --> 04:36:42.349 align:start position:0%
no the prevailing part's legitimate
interest

04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
but I think we should make a reference
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
59586 I think so too you you follow me
 
04:36:52.109 --> 04:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
with that 59886 has basically it's a
 
04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
search warrant statute sure and and
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
there would be protections for your bank
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
account under the Fourth Amendment but
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
the the distinction with private keys
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
and and the reason many people think
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
there should be special statutory
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
protections around private keys that are
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
especially protective and have something
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
like an irreparable harm standard is
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
once any other person besides me has my
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
private Keys then the security of my
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
private Keys is is just done right and
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to start over whereas
 
04:37:22.750 --> 04:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
there is you can't change your private
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
Key Well I mean in theory you could you
 
04:37:27.629 --> 04:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
could potentially come up with a work
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
around that you can't change your
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
password every day yeah it's I mean it's
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
not like it's not like a password or
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
it's not like you're you're routing them
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
so if if I compromise your private keys
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
and I move the funds then you're done I
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
I own you don't get the funds you if you
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
have a copy of my private ke and someone
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
sees it and gets access to it and moves
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
my funds then I'm also done so it's it's
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
very important that they're that they're
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
held securely and there's not going to
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
be a stop order for example so I would
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
argue the the it says the court shall
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
impose appropriate protection to ensure
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
the disclosure is no broader than is
 
04:38:05.230 --> 04:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to serve the prevailing
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
party's legitimate interest right so
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's we're going to leave that in
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
there but we just still want to give
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
them the right to get access to it which
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
is what
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
59586 sets out the parameters to get
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
access and I would say I don't want to
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
overstay my welcome but I would say uh
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
an irreparable harm standard would do
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
that in any of the kinds of serious uh
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
criminal cases that we're talking about
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
here I mean clear and convincing
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
evidence that's that doesn't require
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
conviction you don't need to to Pro
 
04:38:35.070 --> 04:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
prove Beyond A Reasonable Doubt someone
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
has committed a crime it's just got to
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
be um because it's much more sensitive
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
and much more destructive than when you
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
get into a bank account account it's got
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
to be probably high standard than
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
language here this section was this
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
picked up by any other statute was there
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
another state that has the same yeah
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is model law from and a few other
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
states have adopted it it's in the other
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
um Basics laws that representative Ammon
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
referenced Oklahoma is one I I can't
 
04:39:00.429 --> 04:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
remember the other recent one you
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well okay thank you okay
 
04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
if this was also Port let's talk about
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
some other states okay Mississippi
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
Nebraska Ohio Oklahoma with the first
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
version of it Tennessee both the Senate
 
04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
and the house all rejected it all reject
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
bill I mean that's not a reason for us
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
to reject it and I'm not they did reject
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
it last year and they they probably what
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
did they write in the blurb about what
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
their committee report what was in their
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee report I.E the some of them
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
they never wrote a committee report they
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
did a uh failed to journ which means
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
they just the committee without ever
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
acting on it well what kind of states or
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
do that oh I can't imagine we don't do
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
that we you got to give an explain the
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
reason you're I read our
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
reports actually only one of them
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
actually made it to a vote so Oklahoma
 
04:40:02.670 --> 04:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
and Louisiana they've both passed the
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill in full in my understanding and uh
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
so you can find some that passed I can
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
find some where it failed well you're
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
trying to kill the bill I'm trying to
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
pass the bill no what I want to do is
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
add the Restriction of RSA 595 d a Col 6
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
to that one thing and then I'm
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
okay I thought we just did I I want to
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
add the language of 595 A6 into this
 
04:40:29.070 --> 04:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph then I'm okay and I won't
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
bring up the other I'd like to research
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
it more just having heard it for the
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
first time now and and I'm I'm open to
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
it I'd like to we're working on it we're
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
working on it okay all right we're on to
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
now blockchainbased trust recognized so
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
you any problem with that paragraph what
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
four this is line 19 the only thing I
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
would say about that is hopefully we're
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
going to have on and with
 
04:41:01.948 --> 04:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
hp310 a uh committee to investigate uh a
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
commission to set up to come up with
 
04:41:07.230 --> 04:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
some laws regarding uh stable coin and
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
real world assets and I'm wondering if
 
04:41:12.190 --> 04:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
this might be better handle there
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
although this is strictly blockchain
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
which could be crypto which is not
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily stable coin or the other one
 
04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
so where at what where at this is the
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
committee that does this now no no it's
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
the commission well the commission's
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
already did it that's where this this
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill came from this section no it did
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
not wait wait it didn't come from this
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
commission no this is a this is from a
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh a model legislation that went around
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
to a bunch of States no that's incorrect
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
hold on a second um this blockchain the
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
blockchain trust is a novel it's not in
 
04:41:44.480 --> 04:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
blockchain trust is a novel it's not in
any

04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
model she's not talking about trust yet
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think she's still you still on this
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
par about the private Keys paragraph
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
you're on the trust okay this is this
 
04:41:57.070 --> 04:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
bill in total some of the
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations came from the crypto
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
commission uh the um the blockchain
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
docket is specifically one of the
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations some other pieces of it
 
04:42:08.590 --> 04:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
like the private Keys the zoning stuff
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
came from model legislation uh
 
04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
this uh section about blockchainbased
 
04:42:16.830 --> 04:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
trusts is no other state has even
 
04:42:19.708 --> 04:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
attempted this this is a new a new idea
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
and it's based on precedent in law you
 
04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
can see it references other statutes
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I think we should have
 
04:42:30.270 --> 04:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
something like that and I I'd almost say
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we should break it out and make it
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
its own law so it isn't lumped in with
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
the with the rest of the stuff because
 
04:42:37.230 --> 04:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's a pretty important kind of a
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
piece especially with blockchain being
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh you mean want to put it into the
 
04:42:46.440 --> 04:42:48.510 align:start position:0%
uh you mean want to put it into the
trust

04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
trust
 
04:42:50.910 --> 04:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
law I'm not an expert on trust law I
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
don't know where it goes well I
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
sponsored it you know what the Godfather
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the trust law if we're not
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
piece maybe we we take this and put it
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
as part of the the study commission 310s
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
study and and we can we can do a little
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
more uh cuz there's some there's some
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
Confluence of of uh you know the
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
definition of decentralization is very
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
foundational to this piece and also the
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
stable coin stuff so you know that
 
04:43:25.590 --> 04:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
thing okay if that's what it takes then
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we'll give it to the
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
commission and we have trust experts you
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
know the the chair of the crypto
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
commission basically helped write our
 
04:43:42.270 --> 04:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
trust law
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah so he's uh and we've been
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
talking to him about this who we talking
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
about Bill aringer oh yeah bill yeah
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
Bill's the man yeah Bill's the man okay
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll let Bill's commission
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
figure that one out okay could we let uh
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
attorney hwit just speak to this want to
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.990 --> 04:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
this hit your mic of course yes red red
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
for on I still haven't figured that out
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
after few years red is red is go yeah
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
exactly uh this one so I've actually
 
04:44:24.510 --> 04:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
I've made a blockchainbased trust uh as
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney here in New Hampshire and
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
I've got a published law review article
 
04:44:30.270 --> 04:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
on on trust through the blockchain and I
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
think one of the main reasons this is in
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
here is that kind of the goal
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
overarching goal of this bill as I see
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
it is to just check a few boxes of very
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit where we can make New
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more blockchain friendly
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
through increased kind of clarity and
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
neutral protections that are not big
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
steps and New Hampshire is already a
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
very um friendly state in terms of trust
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
and self-settled asset protection trust
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
law when I passed it it was the first
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
state to do it and and this uh this kind
 
04:44:59.788 --> 04:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
of does what representative spear was
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
suggesting earlier with Banking and just
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
kind of takes our existing statutes and
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
just says and also you can do this over
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
the blockchain um the right now um
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
self-settled asset protection trusts or
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
what they're called irr irrevocable
 
04:45:16.750 --> 04:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
spendthrift trust in our law come from
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
the common law of impossibility correct
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
as I I take it many of you know and then
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
our statutes also just take that common
 
04:45:26.590 --> 04:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
law and rearticulate it and clarify that
 
04:45:28.830 --> 04:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
if you kind of forfeit your own control
 
04:45:30.670 --> 04:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
over your own money and it's legitimate
 
04:45:32.430 --> 04:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
courts are going to recognize that and
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
that clarification even though that was
 
04:45:35.948 --> 04:45:35.958 align:start position:0%
common law in New Hampshire already was
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
done in statute to bring more business
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire this would also do
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
that with blockchain and I would suggest
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
it really wouldn't change any outcome of
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
any case uh if I was litigating on
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of a client who had set up a
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
self-settled asset protection trust
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
through the blockchain I think any
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer who knows anything about this
 
04:45:56.430 --> 04:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
area would tell you at the end of the
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
day I'm going to win that case in New
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with or without this but the
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
difference is without it I and other
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers like me are going to make more
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
money needlessly arguing cross motions
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
motions for summary judgment Discovery
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
um where whereas if you just clarify it
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
you kind of cut out that practice area
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
attract more business and create more
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
incentive and Clarity for for people in
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
this area to come into the state uh
 
04:46:22.708 --> 04:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
believe it or not you just gave the for
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
speech I gave when I wrote the trust law
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay because everything was case law and
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
I was cutting we're cutting out the the
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting of case of lawyers having
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
to go through and figure out the case
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
law and that was the purpose of the
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
trust act having said that um I had like
 
04:46:42.990 --> 04:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
100 lawyers in the room when I was
 
04:46:45.150 --> 04:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
drawing this stuff up and they all of
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
them had you know 106 opinions so so I
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
would say is that yeah I hear you but
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to have those those legal
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
beagles to go through this and make sure
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
that they feel comfortable that this is
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be stuck in the trust
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
side I remember reading your committee
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
report so it's not a coincidence so are
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
you're thinking in terms of moving it
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
over to the commission well just we
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
could pull this out now
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
and and I mean if nothing else I'll I'll
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
bring in as a separate bill for next
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
year but that you know it's it's I want
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure the idea of it is
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
trust people trust people right place
 
04:47:28.030 --> 04:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you good idea Keith well
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
I think this is this would be a novel
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
thing that no other state has tried and
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
it fits it fits nicely with New
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's why I want to do it
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
because you want to sponsor it when I TR
 
04:47:41.230 --> 04:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
so we will take this out of the bill
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay this section will come out of the
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
V5 would come out of the bill I I
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
remember it come out of the bill and
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
then we will they will they will give it
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
to the commission it'll be of the bill
 
04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do well we're
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
almost there we're we're now down to
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
V6 processing regarding blockchain
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
networks yeah and so you'll see on I'm
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
on page five right yes and some bold
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
face stuff there so I I think
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the the Roman numeral 2 and three
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
the old one I I think we could probably
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
get rid of that because it's redundant
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's already there already is an
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
exemption in 399 G that we've had since
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
2017 it's been recodified oh Money Train
 
04:48:29.070 --> 04:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we already so I I mean do we I
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
don't maybe we want to State it
 
04:48:32.510 --> 04:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly so it's there or but it's not
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
necessary in my
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
feedback it's I guess it doesn't H
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're just repeating what's already
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
statute right right are you taking up
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
the L so these all these yeah two three
 
04:48:48.920 --> 04:48:53.230 align:start position:0%
the L so these all these yeah two three
and

04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
four yeah right yeah two two two and
 
04:48:58.350 --> 04:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
three is what I have right y just two
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
and three the 399 G I mean it's it might
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
be helpful to someone reading the wall
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
that you know well but this is Page Six
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
right yeah we're on page five and you
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
can see that highlighted
 
04:49:13.878 --> 04:49:16.310 align:start position:0%
can see that highlighted
okay

04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:49:19.868 --> 04:49:19.878 align:start position:0%
um oh it it it makes the references to
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
the statutes that that did it which is
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
fine just leave them in it's it's fine
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
leave so we're leaving call them yeah
 
04:49:29.948 --> 04:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
just leave that in all right because
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're yeah they're fine because
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're already law right and
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
they're just they're just like if
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
somebody if somebody thought they might
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to be you know registered as a
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
transfer see that no they
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
don't because it back in commodity it is
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
not legal
 
04:49:52.590 --> 04:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
tender okay moving on to Roman numeral
 
04:49:52.600 --> 04:49:57.310 align:start position:0%
tender okay moving on to Roman numeral
five

04:49:57.310 --> 04:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
is so not face liability related to a
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
specific TR merely by validating that
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
transaction yeah so validating is part
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
of the protocol so if you're running a
 
04:50:10.270 --> 04:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
node transactions are coming through
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
your node and if you're you know if
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're if you're validating a
 
04:50:17.788 --> 04:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
transaction you you might be the first
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
to add it to the blockchain or you might
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
be validating what others have already
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
added to the blockchain that there's no
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
liability for you just simply validating
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
transaction that's that's what a node
 
04:50:29.910 --> 04:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
does okay right so
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's all right can I ask yeah and I I I
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
kind of agree with that I mean it makes
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
sense but in the cases where illegal
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
concerned can there be any liability
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
that you know if a block change is being
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
used if you are the person initiating
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
the transaction then yes you might have
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
liability if you're doing something
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
nefarious and you're the you're moving
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
your own funds but just because the
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
blockchain is validating it doesn't mean
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I know what you're saying yeah all
 
04:51:11.310 --> 04:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
right this is okay
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
civil basically a loser pays
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
right uh well that's
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and it references the blockchain
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
dispute docket which will talk
 
04:51:47.628 --> 04:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
about yep it's fine cability it's a
 
04:51:53.708 --> 04:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
Clause gives us off the hook for the
 
04:51:55.878 --> 04:51:57.110 align:start position:0%
Clause gives us off the hook for the
whole

04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill right and blockchain dispute docket
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so this was one of the major
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the final report in
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
the crypto uh commission and it's
 
04:52:11.548 --> 04:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
basically if you think about Delaware
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
being the the you know the the king
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
court right they have their own
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
chancellory court and that's one of the
 
04:52:22.990 --> 04:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
reasons why you want to U potentially
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
register an a corporation in Delaware
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
because they have that dispute
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
resolution they have the knowledge they
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't have the trust law they just have
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
case law just case law and they have
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
lots of case law everybody's at a
 
04:52:36.080 --> 04:52:37.310 align:start position:0%
lots of case law everybody's at a
corporation

04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
Delaware and so this language comes from
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
the business dispute docket and attorney
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
huitt explained this very well during
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
the public hearing the language is
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
really just a lift of the business
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
dispute docket which exists and replaces
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
it with blockchain and requires that
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
there be some technical expertise uh
 
04:52:58.830 --> 04:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
that the the judge presiding should have
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
some technical expertise and in the
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
beginning it might not be used very much
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
so that judge can do can also uh hear
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
other cases unrelated to blockchain but
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
that at least the industry knows if they
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
have a dispute that there is uh you know
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
a judge and a docket specifically for
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
blockchain and you can see based on the
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
definitions and all the concepts that
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that you need some
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
expertise to you know be judicious in
 
04:53:29.310 --> 04:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know resolving disputes or deciding
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
cases so that's the idea behind the
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
dispute you what the lift is the
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
business dispute docket there's language
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
and statute that establish the business
 
04:53:40.590 --> 04:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
dispute docket that's a real thing that
 
04:53:42.750 --> 04:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
exist yeah we have our TR court now we
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
now have a statute so so the the
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
language that established that we
 
04:53:49.230 --> 04:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
repurposed and replaced it with
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
blockchain and it's to satisfy the
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the in the crypto
 
04:53:54.638 --> 04:53:55.948 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the in the crypto
commission

04:53:55.948 --> 04:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
report so it's it's sort of like just uh
 
04:54:01.708 --> 04:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
taking a model that has already worked
 
04:54:03.948 --> 04:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
and repurposing it specifically for
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
blockchain does it cost any money to set
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
up a
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
docket theoretically there's an
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
allocation of a
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
judge and but you know the the court
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
system always says they don't have
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
enough judge but they they always make
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
it so we don't pay attention to that we
 
04:54:21.480 --> 04:54:23.868 align:start position:0%
it so we don't pay attention to that we
ignore

04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
04:54:23.878 --> 04:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
ignore
them

04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
so and then the the effective dates so
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
section four that's the dispute docket
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's January 1st
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
2026 and then everything else is 60 days
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
after passage so it gives the court some
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
time to
 
04:54:41.948 --> 04:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
you know contemplate how they're going
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:45.958 --> 04:54:48.270 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:54:48.270 --> 04:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
right okay so going
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.840 --> 04:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh original we're going
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
to fix on page
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
three the state local agency subdivision
 
04:55:11.920 --> 04:55:12.948 align:start position:0%
three the state local agency subdivision
thereof

04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
shall and we'll make sure that it's uh
 
04:55:19.070 --> 04:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's about giving them a GU guidance and
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.760 --> 04:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
zoning

04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:55:27.310 --> 04:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
and then on page
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
four um they have some stuff they struck
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
out and then we have a reference we want
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
to reference the right to private Keys
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
reference the uh procedural process of
 
04:55:38.240 --> 04:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
reference the uh procedural process of
59586

04:55:41.270 --> 04:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to take uh the V5
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
blockchainbased trust recognition take
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
that out of the bill at this point and a
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
give it to the commission and and B run
 
04:55:54.910 --> 04:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
it through the legal beagles and see if
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
we can uh put in a separate bill for
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
next year get that
 
04:55:59.760 --> 04:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
next year get that
going

04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
it okay we still have another
 
04:56:09.310 --> 04:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so you have plenty of
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
it exact where I'm I'm going to have
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
legislative Services help me write the
 
04:56:25.270 --> 04:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
write that out
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay do we do anything with this uh
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
extensive conversation going through the
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.390 --> 04:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
line all right you all right Keith good

yeah thank and thank you for everyone's
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
patience going through this um we'll
 
04:56:45.788 --> 04:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
knock a whole bunch out at once and then
 
04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have to hear it again so thank
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
you we're not any determination no we're
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
not doing anything because this will be
 
04:56:56.190 --> 04:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee once we get the
 
04:56:56.200 --> 04:56:58.910 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee once we get the
amendment

04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
dra okay all right what do we got
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
left paint 451 I love this paint people
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%

morning have just one bill well on for
 
04:58:01.150 --> 04:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
me just one bill if you're in the Liquor
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
Commission you got bills in the
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon yeah you're going to be okay
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
D I don't
 
04:58:07.440 --> 04:58:09.110 align:start position:0%
D I don't
know

04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
Jackson you're up there you know if it's
 
04:58:16.030 --> 04:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
I don't mind sow I think
 
04:58:19.868 --> 04:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
it's well I I I just get out early and
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh go on the highway doesn't bother me
 
04:58:22.320 --> 04:58:24.230 align:start position:0%
uh go on the highway doesn't bother me
that

04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:24.240 --> 04:58:26.190 align:start position:0%
that
much

04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:58:28.548 --> 04:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the subcommittee on
 
04:58:31.628 --> 04:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:31.638 --> 04:58:33.788 align:start position:0%
 
451

04:58:33.788 --> 04:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
451
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
um okay so I think that the biggest
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
Bugaboo is funding
 
04:58:42.200 --> 04:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
Bugaboo is funding
mechanism

04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
um and the way I saw it was the The
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
Entity that does this collecting or
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
setting this up is an organization that
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
is created by paint
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and therefore it only
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
seems rational that the paint
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers shouldn't
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
be wasting their time with the state of
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and regul and this is
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
their organization that they should just
 
04:59:14.430 --> 04:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
directly and way I I guess in the bill
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
the I read the bill is that the initial
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
monies was that they are going they were
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
going to it front the money so why not
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
just front the money and then pass on
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of managing this entity that is
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
Theirs to collect the paint why don't
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
they just pay for it and and have and
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
we'll all be happy happy isn't that what
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
they did though I think that's what no
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
they have a fee at the point of
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
sale there wasn't a but they don't have
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
to do that I that's not the way I
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
understood it the way I understood it
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
okay is that it would just simply add if
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
a gallon of paint was 30 bucks then this
 
05:00:03.788 --> 05:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
they the retail value would be 3150 or
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
something like that it wouldn't be 30
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
bucks plus you're paying 150 yes it was
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
built into it just like with her liquor
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
yeah stuff that's the way I understood
 
05:00:14.590 --> 05:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
it well that that's not the way it was
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%

um yeah that's that's who I am so happy
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions I have uh been
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the operation side of this program in
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
multiple States um including Minnesota
 
05:01:08.430 --> 05:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
um where I used to live for 20 years so
 
05:01:10.190 --> 05:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm real familiar with all these is kind
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
of I can clear up any claric you know
 
05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
anything that's misconceptions or
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
anything so how does it actually work
 
05:01:17.548 --> 05:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
how does the program actually work so it
 
05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
is like this the you you were correct in
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
saying that it's very similar to how the
 
05:01:24.548 --> 05:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
beer Tax Works here in um in in New
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the manufacturer um is
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
obligated by law to add a certain amount
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
of money to um or in this case in the
 
05:01:36.030 --> 05:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
beerx it's a distributor but there's a
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
different distribution model for for
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
paint but just you know manufacturer
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
Andor distributor is obligated to add um
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
whatever this cost is to the price that
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
is paid by the retailer when it takes it
 
05:01:52.590 --> 05:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
into inventory and then that is then
 
05:01:54.788 --> 05:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in the price that they are
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
paid that that is paid by the customer
 
05:02:01.230 --> 05:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
um so yeah it is is is in that same vein
 
05:02:02.910 --> 05:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I think where the hangup might have
 
05:02:05.788 --> 05:02:05.798 align:start position:0%
might have been is about the display of
 
05:02:09.708 --> 05:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
any particular fee on a receipt you know
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the fee tries to give a retailer an
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
option to know about this I think what I
 
05:02:18.190 --> 05:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
maybe heard because I watch the
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from afar good last time was
 
05:02:23.470 --> 05:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe there was an issue with that
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
option and not giving the option to the
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
retailer to B
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
basically be silent on that and
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
just let the mystery be so to speak like
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
as with the beer tax is that fair to
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
say um the beer tax is invisible that is
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
true that the consumer has no idea that
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
there was a beer tax involved yes so
 
05:02:48.670 --> 05:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
sorry and and uh so in a sense that you
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
are going to show us because I I don't
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
read it but that way so maybe you can
 
05:02:55.150 --> 05:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
show me where it is in the bill but that
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
it says that this the fee is going to be
 
05:03:04.110 --> 05:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
part of um the wholesale price is going
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be added to the wholesale price and
 
05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the retailer the even the retailer so
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
I would I call it it's almost like a vat
 
05:03:16.548 --> 05:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
tax are you familiar with the way
 
05:03:19.590 --> 05:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
Europeans do their value added tax it's
 
05:03:23.310 --> 05:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
added uh at at the time transfer from
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler to the
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
retailer the the fee is ADD added to it
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
but in my case when because we don't
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a beer distributor system right and
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
then and then basically you're building
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
it into your wholesale price correct and
 
05:03:41.548 --> 05:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
and in the sense that um you know it is
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
illegal for manufacturers to
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
unilaterally increase their prices that
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
isn't somewhat what compels this to be
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
written into statute and that
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would would like to put
 
05:03:55.230 --> 05:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
put this cost but you know again it
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
would be violation of antitrust laws to
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
do so well that's only if you're calling
 
05:04:02.548 --> 05:04:02.558 align:start position:0%
it a something that that all the are
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
doing together but if you are uh
 
05:04:08.590 --> 05:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
treating it as a cost of goods sold is
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
this as a cost of do doing business and
 
05:04:15.310 --> 05:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
that part of your business is uh one in
 
05:04:18.310 --> 05:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
some cases you might have one of your
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
businesses did you have a um you send
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
one of your mark your people they come
 
05:04:26.430 --> 05:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
in and help build a the display in the
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
store and how it's displayed and shown
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
okay in this case you are providing a
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
service that has that's going to come in
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
and pick up all this paint that was left
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
over okay and and taking care of it so
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
it has there's no direct connection to
 
05:04:48.750 --> 05:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
this being a
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
uniform uh
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility that that that affects
 
05:04:55.708 --> 05:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
the antitrust laws okay which is why I
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
think you're referring to but that this
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
is just a cost of doing business then
 
05:05:02.590 --> 05:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
you are rolling in your business because
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
for some you know you know you might
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
have a variable payment schedule about
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
how you handle the paint in different
 
05:05:11.230 --> 05:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
paints and how you with the type of
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
paint who knows what you might do and
 
05:05:16.470 --> 05:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
how to dispose this stuff I just don't
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
want to get in the business of measuring
 
05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
it or quantifying it or putting any
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
dollar valot to it so I just don't want
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
it in a statute you know I want this to
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
all be transparent you're taking care of
 
05:05:31.150 --> 05:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
this behind the scenes and it's just a
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business John Page two
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
me e
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
GBS I don't want to know if it Fe me
 
05:06:00.310 --> 05:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't even think we need the
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislation frankly you guys can just go
 
05:06:03.788 --> 05:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
ahead and do this and you don't need us
 
05:06:03.798 --> 05:06:04.628 align:start position:0%
ahead and do this and you don't need us
at

05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
all yeah
 
05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
except the last page
 
05:06:12.510 --> 05:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
what's the last
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
page yes I'd love to talk about the last
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
page okay so page five line 7 through
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
14 seems like you want to skirt the
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
state laws converting solvents into
 
05:06:26.480 --> 05:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
state laws converting solvents into
Universal

05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
waste and then 10 through 14 you want us
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
to take away all responsibility if
 
05:06:33.400 --> 05:06:34.910 align:start position:0%
to take away all responsibility if
there's

05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
any spill or
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
so that this particular provision you're
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
talking about 149 m73 post consumer
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
paint for houses and small businesses y
 
05:06:54.270 --> 05:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
so this is this is um I may not be the
 
05:06:56.830 --> 05:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
best person to speak on this I I
 
05:06:58.150 --> 05:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
understand that as I as this is a
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
provision that um really covers the
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
challenges of accepting this
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
material um you know as it it would be
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
delivered to a retail location it's more
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
to in this in every state that this
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
program operates it operates in 13
 
05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
states covering a third of the United
 
05:07:18.670 --> 05:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
States um there are usually some rules
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
around handling of paint that need to
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
dis ways what's that asard is way
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is sometimes it isn't and
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
these are um you know typically re rules
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
that somebody else you can have somebody
 
05:07:33.270 --> 05:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
else do it you don't have to do this
 
05:07:35.948 --> 05:07:35.958 align:start position:0%
just simple sure just simple to say that
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
it enables the program to
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
function as intended makes the program
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.480 --> 05:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
cop take thanks so is this a new

Hampshire to collect a household
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste they would typically
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
become a uh a generator of hazardous
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
waste so Most
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
states I don't know about most but many
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
states household hazardous waste is
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
exempt from regulation from Cradle to
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
grave in New Hampshire households are
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
exempt from the regulation but once they
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
bring it to a collection facility that
 
05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
facility is now the generator of that
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste that's not the case in
 
05:09:05.798 --> 05:09:06.948 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste that's not the case in
every

05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
state most paints are latex paints and
 
05:09:11.910 --> 05:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're not considered hazardous waste
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that would be acceptable for most
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
places to collect
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
those oilbased paints and solvents
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
however are hazardous
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
waste many states have designated
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
oilbased paints as a universal waste so
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
Universal wastes are things like your
 
05:09:32.910 --> 05:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
light bulbs with Mercury in them anti-
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
freezed um other Mercury containing
 
05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
devices aerosol cans so these are things
 
05:09:41.708 --> 05:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
that are technically hazardous waste but
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
because they're designated as universal
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
waste the standards to manage them are a
 
05:09:48.670 --> 05:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
little less strict because most of the
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
time they're being recycled um and
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're just ubiquitous and it would be
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
hard to regulate them for everybody that
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
has them so that's the the thought
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
behind designating things as universal
 
05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
waste so we had suggested is rather than
 
05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
make every Ace Hardware Store become a
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
generator of hazardous waste because
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
they took a gallon of of oilbased paint
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
if we designate that paint as universal
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
waste then they can take it and not be a
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
generator of hazardous waste and then
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
it's still collected and managed the
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
same way it would be if it was hazardous
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
waste because it's being picked up by
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
paint care and being properly disposed
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
of or recycled if it can be so there's
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
any questions about
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that so in that process when they making
 
05:10:37.948 --> 05:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
the transfer if there's a spill you want
 
05:10:40.830 --> 05:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
the state to wave out liability
 
05:10:43.470 --> 05:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
that's the way this reads right so that
 
05:10:46.270 --> 05:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
the facility that collects it as long
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
the way the bill reads as long as
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing everything properly if
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's an incidental spill it doesn't
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
relieve them of having to clean it up it
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
just relieves them of the liability is
 
05:10:57.240 --> 05:11:00.190 align:start position:0%
just relieves them of the liability is
my

05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
understanding so we want to wave our pen
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous becomes non-hazardous and we
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
to wave liability so I mean they clean
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
clean up their
 
05:11:17.628 --> 05:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
mess okay okay thank
 
05:11:17.638 --> 05:11:19.470 align:start position:0%
mess okay okay thank
you

05:11:19.470 --> 05:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
so that convinces me that yes we should
 
05:11:22.878 --> 05:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
so that convinces me that yes we should
pass

05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
something but it hasn't convinced me
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
to make this fee
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
transparent how do we make this fee
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
transparent how do we make it so we
 
05:11:37.948 --> 05:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about what the fee
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
is or c modifying the fee I want to be
 
05:11:45.070 --> 05:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
free to let the paint manufacturers
 
05:11:47.070 --> 05:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
want given that they're the ones who are
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
Contracting this uh
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
codings people
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
away so it's interesting because um this
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
is actually the only
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
legislation um that I worked on that has
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
a few mentioned in the bill so by like
 
05:12:22.548 --> 05:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
with dollars and cents on it well I
 
05:12:26.548 --> 05:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
no sorry there there's a just you can
 
05:12:30.990 --> 05:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
just stay here for the record my name
 
05:12:31.000 --> 05:12:31.868 align:start position:0%
just stay here for the record my name
dou

05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
dou
 
05:12:35.548 --> 05:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
SE okay uh my name is Karen Eble May ma
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
district 7 I'm the prime sponsor of the
 
05:12:41.590 --> 05:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh when we went or when they went
 
05:12:44.190 --> 05:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
through the process of developing a bill
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
last year there seemed to be interest in
 
05:12:50.270 --> 05:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
having the fee in there I think from I
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for pain care but if
 
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's your preference not to have the fee
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
in there I don't think anybody would
 
05:12:58.510 --> 05:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
object I certainly wouldn't object to it
 
05:13:06.270 --> 05:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
deleted but I think um representative h
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
I think that the object the objection I
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
think the original objection was the
 
05:13:15.788 --> 05:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
part about
 
05:13:19.990 --> 05:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
the the retailer disclosing the fee to
 
05:13:21.948 --> 05:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
the End customer that that got our
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
attention yes right you know in state
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
that does not have general sales tax
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
there that got our attention right and
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so it's interesting because again we
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
work in different states and different
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
states have different preferences some
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
require you to put it on there because
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
of consumer transparency protection laws
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
Etc and other states they just have
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
different opinions so this is just
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
something I feel like an easily
 
05:13:48.270 --> 05:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
addressable thing to to accommodate the
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
needs of a state that has a different
 
05:13:52.670 --> 05:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
perspective than than Oregon or
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
something like that um there is language
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
here that allows folks to incorporate
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
the fee into the receipt that language
 
05:14:04.350 --> 05:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily need to be there um
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
if we were to you know write the bill
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
from zero we might not include it others
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
have suggested it for transparency
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
reasons um but the basic the part about
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
the to the the point about the existing
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
function of the beer tax where
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer passes to distributor
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
passes to retailer that is kind of how
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
these things work well is that they the
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
fee is passed down correctly from one to
 
05:14:29.788 --> 05:14:29.798 align:start position:0%
the other and then in terms of when it
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
the customer buys it it's fully loaded
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
into the cost and you're right the
 
05:14:35.788 --> 05:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
customer does not necessarily need to
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
know about that some states they prefer
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
they do and if this State prefers not
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be there's no nothing
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
about the functioning of the program
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
that is contingent on that is what I
 
05:14:50.230 --> 05:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
should say okay so how much how much am
 
05:14:54.190 --> 05:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
fee sorry let me
 
05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
move because it just seems like all this
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
is all
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
just again one one more comment the way
 
05:15:15.788 --> 05:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
it was presented to us the woman that
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
presented I don't I don't remember her
 
05:15:20.190 --> 05:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
name um I
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
think yeah I understood it to be like
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
the liquor bill but I think the she
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
understood that we wanted to see that
 
05:15:32.110 --> 05:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
fee that be transparent we don't but but
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
she presented it as if it
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
was that was just something some added
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
information that was quite frankly not
 
05:15:44.548 --> 05:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
needed well um I was I was just going to
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
say as Jeremy um mentioned different
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
states have interests in different ways
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
and they also had gone through the
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
process of this bill last year I think
 
05:15:58.110 --> 05:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem with removing the
 
05:16:01.470 --> 05:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
fee specification similarly there's not
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
a issue with deleting the language that
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
gives retailers the option of disclosing
 
05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the fee um
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I think there's language in here
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
about an auditor I mean at some point
 
05:16:16.548 --> 05:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
people are really interested in making
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
sure that what's being collected is
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
correct um I mean I think we can
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about all of those things
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
to um to make this work okay let's do it
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
I got my pen all right well I mean we'd
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
have to run it by so the woman who was
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
here before was Heidi mlli she's at the
 
05:16:37.708 --> 05:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
American codings
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
Association um his his boss I think
 
05:16:44.430 --> 05:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
there is some sensitivity honestly to
 
05:16:47.390 --> 05:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
the antitrust laws because um you know
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
if you're sort of setting a fee there's
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
some concern that's why we don't want
 
05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
anything about it but they still are
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to be charging okay we can talk
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
about that and we've got to run it up
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
the rail to the to the ACA but um do you
 
05:17:07.510 --> 05:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
have a copying okay all right
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm I don't want to just go let's
 
05:17:12.750 --> 05:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
just go through it and see the things
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
that you're concerned about Mr chair if
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
I had my word process or I just every
 
05:17:19.470 --> 05:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
time it says fee just say
 
05:17:21.628 --> 05:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
delete I'm right now I'm starting at
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
page two I don't even know I guess I
 
05:17:24.990 --> 05:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
have to read the whole
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
bill and see anywhere is any
 
05:17:32.590 --> 05:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
mention of this
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
fee 16
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
says that's where it starts
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
line 16 describe the funding
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism that okay Jeremy has a comment
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
so I've worked in a few different
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
Industries who've
 
05:17:54.270 --> 05:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
had aspirations to do something like
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
this but the one thing that holds them
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
back um is the fact that there are
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
members of the industry that wish not to
 
05:18:04.708 --> 05:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
pay this fee that would we call them
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
Free Riders and they'd much rather just
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know know say no thank you and um
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
the paint industry is you know 95% of
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
the paint industry are a members but
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
there are 5% that are not and um they're
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
on board with this program like this
 
05:18:23.948 --> 05:18:23.958 align:start position:0%
program exists in 13 states it's very
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
successful it's a paragon of success
 
05:18:29.310 --> 05:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
however without like
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
section um on page two section one and
 
05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
two where the fee is sort of established
 
05:18:39.150 --> 05:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
in statute manufacturers can tell us to
 
05:18:42.910 --> 05:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
sand and that is what stops any industry
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
from just doing this if they so choose
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
so I worked in other Industries where
 
05:18:49.628 --> 05:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
one company really wanted to do it
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
another company didn't and the whole
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
thing scuttled so this language
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
compelling it is part and parcel of
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
making sure there are no Free Riders and
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
that everybody pays in within the
 
05:19:04.430 --> 05:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
industry and that's the main reason for
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
this maybe we can come up with different
 
05:19:06.958 --> 05:19:11.390 align:start position:0%
this maybe we can come up with different
language

05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
right that provides for a cost additive
 
05:19:16.990 --> 05:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
but we're
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
not talking about a fe person we we do
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
use the phrase funding mechanism we can
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
massage that but the phrase there is a
 
05:19:29.470 --> 05:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
fun you see when you put it in our
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
statutes then it looks like a sales
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
tax okay it looks like a tax all
 
05:19:40.750 --> 05:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
right so all I'm saying to you is we
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
think this is great we're glad that the
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
paint manufacturers want to do this and
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
we think it's very POS that the best you
 
05:19:52.470 --> 05:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
can do maybe is uh uh when you sell
 
05:19:56.310 --> 05:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
paint you put a something on there some
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
stand that that you they're
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
participating in this program and those
 
05:20:04.030 --> 05:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
freeloaders won't be able to add that on
 
05:20:05.948 --> 05:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
their cans of
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
paints yeah you know that that you're
 
05:20:11.788 --> 05:20:11.798 align:start position:0%
doing this because you are doing a
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
service you're you're providing a
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
service uh it's it's a nominal cost and
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
most of the time like when companies are
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
giving away giving away something they
 
05:20:22.590 --> 05:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
say we give certain percentage of our
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
profits to a nonprofit do like that they
 
05:20:29.548 --> 05:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
use it as a marketing okay so in my mind
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
you're doing this as a marketing and so
 
05:20:35.788 --> 05:20:35.798 align:start position:0%
therefore um you know the terms of the
 
05:20:38.310 --> 05:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh the retailer or anybody like say
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
we're we're selling the product that
 
05:20:43.150 --> 05:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
that has is participating in that
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
takeback program and people are
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be aware about it
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
because they're going to see that
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
display or wherever people leave the
 
05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
take back paints and the sign's going to
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
say these are provided by and you could
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
put the company names that are up there
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
and so that the consumers know that
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're the good guys who are
 
05:21:04.350 --> 05:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
participating in the program and yes I
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
understand there's always freeloaders um
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know this committee get we get uh
 
05:21:11.708 --> 05:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
lots of bills dealing with people who
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
don't pay their bills like ambulance
 
05:21:18.030 --> 05:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
balance balance billing bills okay so we
 
05:21:20.110 --> 05:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
all know about the fact that sometimes
 
05:21:22.510 --> 05:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
not everybody is a participant but we
 
05:21:24.190 --> 05:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
just think it's great that you guys are
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
doing this uh we're giving you clearly
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
something that's a little squeamish for
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
us that we're giving you a waiver on
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
liability to do this to pull this trick
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
off so that um we're at that extents
 
05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
where we want to draw the line um I
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
personally the way I see as business as
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
the cost of managing those those paints
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
and how you fit efficiently I don't like
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
the idea when there's a number when they
 
05:21:52.868 --> 05:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
put put numbers because when I see
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
numbers in the bill that means there's a
 
05:21:58.110 --> 05:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
potential that needs to change it oh I I
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
totally agree with you on that if you
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
guys are comfortable with not h i mean
 
05:22:07.708 --> 05:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
especially uh removing that uh online 26
 
05:22:09.150 --> 05:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
there that whole
 
05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
I'm starting at
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
at I think there we need to come up with
 
05:22:18.670 --> 05:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
a different uh concept for the idea but
 
05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
I think we just straight up can delete
 
05:22:22.868 --> 05:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
section three
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
entirely um okay there is a part of me
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
and I hate to say this but uh if I were
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
to be so Draconian about this that I
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
would might line in and say a sentence
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the state you know that that
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation Financial oblig
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
I was going to I I prefer to just leave
 
05:22:43.788 --> 05:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
that issue mute and not put it into the
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
bill but to make it clear because um you
 
05:22:51.190 --> 05:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of very conservative
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
people in the house here on the house
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
floor and to have the house Commerce
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
passing this bill um I think they would
 
05:23:01.628 --> 05:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
really feel very reassured if I had a
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
sentence in there and said that there
 
05:23:05.390 --> 05:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
would be no
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
obligation paid by the consumer but I
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
just leave it you leave it just get it
 
05:23:12.910 --> 05:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
out of the bill and and having at the
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
end of the day this is a wonderful
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
program that the wholesale that the
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of paints are going to
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
provide to the state of New
 
05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I agree I think I think the
 
05:23:26.190 --> 05:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
part the last part what you said about
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that the public receives
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
this service um without having um sort
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
of their their knowledge or having been
 
05:23:35.230 --> 05:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
thrown in their face or anything like
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
that reminded reminded Etc that that is
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
totally achievable again the language
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
you see here is just in response to what
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard from other people who wanted
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
this in their state and wanted people to
 
05:23:49.390 --> 05:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
know about it disclosure yada yada but
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that part of it is again you've
 
05:23:53.708 --> 05:23:53.718 align:start position:0%
raised some very interesting things for
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
me to think about in terms of is it
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
really necessary if it's the will of the
 
05:24:00.270 --> 05:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
people that it's not necessary and of
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
course if it doesn't run 95% of you are
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
all in compliance and doesn't run a f
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
I'm talking specifically about the feet
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
to the consumer that the consumer sees
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
right on a receipt or anything like that
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the industry imposing it
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
upon itself you're not imposing upon
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
yourself you're all taking this is so we
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
have this is a semantics conversation
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
sure okay so what I'm saying is charge a
 
05:24:26.590 --> 05:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
c is that you you the wholesaler set it
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
in your price and one of the things that
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
you do and help when you SE sell the
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
paint to the retailer when you're
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
Distributing it you're a distributor and
 
05:24:40.548 --> 05:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
I I and I bet you guys have Distributors
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay and I'm sure what the
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
distributor is going to say to Ace
 
05:24:46.360 --> 05:24:47.910 align:start position:0%
distributor is going to say to Ace
Hardware

05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hardware
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
or Walmart whatever they're going to say
 
05:24:55.030 --> 05:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
is that um part of this fee is that
 
05:24:57.510 --> 05:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to set up at your retail
 
05:25:00.030 --> 05:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
location this display that's going to
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
take the paints back and we're going to
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
bring a truck around once a week or once
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
a month or whatever it's going to remove
 
05:25:09.868 --> 05:25:09.878 align:start position:0%
all that all that part is voluntary okay
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
it's all voluntary so in that sense
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's operated
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
through this entity that you're doing so
 
05:25:18.750 --> 05:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying there's no
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
particular need for the consumers to
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
know other than that how wonderful it is
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the paint they're about to buy has
 
05:25:28.510 --> 05:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
is participating in this Pro take act
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
program the part about the consumer
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
knowing you'll get no disagreement we'll
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
we'll still put a little brochures up
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
for them to understand what good it's
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
doing etc etc but um yeah point taken
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
about the consumers um not needing to
 
05:25:44.590 --> 05:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily be fully so one thing I was
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
just going to mention this does have an
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
FN and the and the second committee is
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
finance um there really isn't a fiscal
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
effect on this um so maybe uh the chair
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
would be interested in waving it so it
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
can just go its merry way I will
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely if you take out all this
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
language that's offending I will
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely speak to the chairman and
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
tell them that they can wave the bill
 
05:26:13.070 --> 05:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
through um okay well let us take it back
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the assuming that that Dees doesn't
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
have any
 
05:26:16.798 --> 05:26:26.350 align:start position:0%
have any
other

05:26:26.350 --> 05:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
cost well I mean you are a Marvel to me
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
you really are well I think um I after
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
prasing this yeah I know I I did I just
 
05:26:39.788 --> 05:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
want to say that um it's as I explained
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
during the hearing I really under the
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances with our Revenue I wanted
 
05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was Revenue neutral
 
05:26:49.470 --> 05:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
for the agency and I was thankful that
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
pain care um did that I just just for
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
the heck of it I want to give you a
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
statistic that I just learned um since
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
they started this program Pain Care has
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
collected 75 million gallons of paint
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
and he said that the uh per
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
gallon it's 10 to 11 pounds per gallon
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
of avoided landfill in our in our
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
neighboring states of Vermont and Maine
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
where this program has been in place for
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
about a decade um we've collected almost
 
05:27:24.750 --> 05:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
two million gallons in those two states
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's 20 million pounds um you
 
05:27:30.628 --> 05:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
know 10,000 tons of material that's not
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
in a landfill uh as a result of this
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
program uh and that doesn't even include
 
05:27:37.868 --> 05:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
the cans that's just the cans right
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
right the cans are also in that total so
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's metal that is metal that is metal
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
that is metal that is being reclaimed
 
05:27:47.470 --> 05:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
and recycled not in a landfill not
 
05:27:49.110 --> 05:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
taking up space I think that's the one
 
05:27:50.548 --> 05:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
of the key things is that all that
 
05:27:53.910 --> 05:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
material is both bulky messy potentially
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
you know leech Etc but it's just not the
 
05:27:58.868 --> 05:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
if none of that is necessarily um
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
relevant it's not taking up space it's
 
05:28:04.470 --> 05:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
being diverted and um 80% of that paint
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
That's collected is becoming a new
 
05:28:08.430 --> 05:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
product and putting back into Commerce
 
05:28:11.548 --> 05:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
so lot upsides there um but certainly in
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
a state with some landfill challenges
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
that I think is potentially relevant I
 
05:28:19.628 --> 05:28:19.638 align:start position:0%
think people care so Mr chair um why
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
don't we try to come up with some
 
05:28:24.750 --> 05:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
language um are is it your idea that you
 
05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
would schedule another work session or
 
05:28:27.600 --> 05:28:28.910 align:start position:0%
would schedule another work session or
go

05:28:28.910 --> 05:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
straight we will we would I would like
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
to have Amendment for next
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
week okay like Tuesday is uh well
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Tuesday would we would be stuck
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
in this room uh Wednesday but I I I have
 
05:28:47.070 --> 05:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
13 uh early bills that yes I'll have
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
make sure they're all had their final
 
05:28:50.470 --> 05:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because we don't do
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
anything you know in the full committee
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
because that would take too much time
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
we' like to have it all all the ducks in
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
a row and we would exec this on the
 
05:29:03.310 --> 05:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
5th okay okay but yes we'd like to have
 
05:29:05.628 --> 05:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
if you can have it to I mean if if the
 
05:29:07.510 --> 05:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
world comes to an end then it would be
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
pushed to the fourth but we would much
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
prefer to have you get get us something
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
next week and and get it to me sooner we
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
get it to will be in touch with you to
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
at least talk before we walk in here
 
05:29:23.110 --> 05:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
with an amendment I want please don't do
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
because I got to have the amendment
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that Revenue why how can it be Revenue
 
05:29:36.190 --> 05:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
Neal because the state of New Hampshire
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have any other than we
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
got to make sure that we haven't done
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
anything the dees has to follow so yeah
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
where is this language in here now that
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's to be just just look at the
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note at the end if I look at um
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
M72 implementated program shall be
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
implemented with they approved by the
 
05:29:57.628 --> 05:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
department the department makes and the
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
date of implementation so I all I saw
 
05:30:04.110 --> 05:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
was that they have to approve whatever
 
05:30:06.030 --> 05:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
right the program to approve the plan
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
there's probably gonna there will be
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
there'll be rule making stop me if I'm
 
05:30:12.510 --> 05:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
wrong there'll be there'll be some rule
 
05:30:14.830 --> 05:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
making so that's the runup to the they
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
have to approve the plan they have to do
 
05:30:19.230 --> 05:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
the rule making that's the run up to the
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
program where was the auditing part oh
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
four that's just the the money flow
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:44.750 --> 05:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
cover where where where page two
 
05:30:54.150 --> 05:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
line 20 oh 20 I'm sorry n
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
29 yes that I I want all that gone
 
05:31:00.390 --> 05:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
anyways all right well we'll have to
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
we'll have to work on all of that what
 
05:31:05.310 --> 05:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of the auditor well to
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
make sure nobody's stealing money yeah
 
05:31:10.150 --> 05:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not my money it's your money
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
who cares it's the it's the
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's money so we don't I mean
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
yeah so that I'm assuming that's all
 
05:31:18.670 --> 05:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
gone well we let's work on it a little
 
05:31:21.310 --> 05:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
bit okay and we'll figure not work too
 
05:31:24.190 --> 05:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
much all right no we got to say
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
something about a cost somewhere we
 
05:31:29.830 --> 05:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't this is okay so the other thing
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
she asked about Revenue if you want WR
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
something cost I going to say the state
 
05:31:36.350 --> 05:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has nothing to do with
 
05:31:40.030 --> 05:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
other than indemnify buying the product
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
well yeah but they have to approve the
 
05:31:41.840 --> 05:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
well yeah but they have to approve the
plan

05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
why why do we need to approve it why
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
don't we we're just trusting that you're
 
05:31:50.788 --> 05:31:50.798 align:start position:0%
going to do a good job of
 
05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
it you know and if you're not then the
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
department you know will say oh my God
 
05:31:56.190 --> 05:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
you're REM making a mess or you're doing
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
something wrong they would they would
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
get to you on this right so how does the
 
05:32:05.470 --> 05:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Agency engage
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
with these programs in other states
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
um basically the law sets out um a
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for a general notion of a
 
05:32:16.750 --> 05:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
plan to describe the operation of the
 
05:32:18.910 --> 05:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
program um there's usually a list of
 
05:32:21.470 --> 05:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
sort of things to discuss in that in
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
that plan it's in the law here it's in
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
the sorry in the bill here where it
 
05:32:27.990 --> 05:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
describes you know basically how much is
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
this program going to um provide to the
 
05:32:34.190 --> 05:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
state in terms of locations will it be
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
convenient will it just provide services
 
05:32:38.788 --> 05:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
in one city or one to Town Etc just kind
 
05:32:41.230 --> 05:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
of list kind of describing how the
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
program is actually going to function um
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then it further describes what
 
05:32:47.310 --> 05:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
products will be collected through the
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
program um just again just the overall
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
scope of what the program will Encompass
 
05:32:55.510 --> 05:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
what it's going to look like and then um
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
let's see how the program will be um
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
managing the material we'll just be
 
05:33:02.470 --> 05:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
collecting it and sending it off to
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
someplace unknown or will it be doing
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
what will be it be doing with it like
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
your rules and procedures of handling or
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
something yeah I what contractors will
 
05:33:12.628 --> 05:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
be used are they reputable you list the
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
contractors okay I mean you want to make
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
sure the stuff is being handled
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
correctly I mean I'm sorry I didn't
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
quite understand Jonathan just said
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
something to me and I didn't quite
 
05:33:26.430 --> 05:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
understand what he said Jonathan milans
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
with Demmer PR you got to pull it closer
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah Jonathan malanson with Demmer prol
 
05:33:33.430 --> 05:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
and Thomas uh you know I think one of
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits of having an oversight
 
05:33:36.320 --> 05:33:38.030 align:start position:0%
the benefits of having an oversight
agency

05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
agency
 
05:33:40.270 --> 05:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
manage this program is it also make sure
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
that whatever contractors are hired you
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
know they're doing this under their
 
05:33:47.190 --> 05:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that they need to
 
05:33:49.868 --> 05:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
follow to manage these very difficult
 
05:33:52.670 --> 05:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
materials um to to avoid to
 
05:33:54.510 --> 05:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cole's point you know
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
avoid any type of spills or mishaps in
 
05:33:59.788 --> 05:33:59.798 align:start position:0%
the transportation of these products oo
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
now we're running the John Hunt's rule
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
of licensure would you be apply do we
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
license people who are going to be
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
picking this stuff up do we have any
 
05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
regulation I'm not looking at you now
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at I'm looking at my state
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
you're all done we all you're all set
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're all set
 
05:34:15.920 --> 05:34:17.948 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're all set
you're

05:34:17.948 --> 05:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:34:17.958 --> 05:34:20.788 align:start position:0%
you're
good

05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
am you want to stay there I mean I don't
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
know you we're all set we're all set
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
CLA to the extent that um a party that's
 
05:34:34.750 --> 05:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
picking up hazardous waste yes is doing
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
so they're required to be a licensed
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste trans supporter that's
 
05:34:41.070 --> 05:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
true now and you already have that lure
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
we already have that system already in
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
place absolutely so when we hold a hous
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
household head space collection day in
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
municipality yeah they hire a contractor
 
05:34:52.110 --> 05:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
who is a LIC transporter that's right
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay but if we're changing the
 
05:34:56.830 --> 05:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
designation from hazardous to Universal
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
then they don't need those licenses uh I
 
05:35:02.110 --> 05:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
think that the for the pickup the the
 
05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
the the folks who are the whole purpose
 
05:35:06.430 --> 05:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
of that Universal waste designation is
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
so that the generators don't end up
 
05:35:12.310 --> 05:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
absorbing a whole host of administrative
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
and specific requirements that apply so
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
if a manufacturing facility generates
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste in any you know
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
significant amount they usually end up
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
having to have an an individual employee
 
05:35:24.830 --> 05:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
or several employees that administer
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
that make sure they're complying with
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the law and and managing their hazardous
 
05:35:30.670 --> 05:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
waste properly in the case of uh
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
Universal waste so reason the whole
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
concept of universal waste was developed
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
is there are certain waste that we all
 
05:35:39.150 --> 05:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
generate routin rely in our homes but
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
they do have hazards associated with
 
05:35:43.788 --> 05:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
them that could be cans of aerosol paint
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
oilbased paint any number of other
 
05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
household products that we have it's not
 
05:35:51.310 --> 05:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
practical to say to a homeowner because
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
you generate that waste we want you to
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
comply with all these requirements that
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
apply to a manufacturing facility so the
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
concept of universal waste was developed
 
05:36:01.628 --> 05:36:01.638 align:start position:0%
to be more practical about it and in the
 
05:36:03.310 --> 05:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
CA in the case that's being applied here
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
with paint uh care a paint stewardship
 
05:36:09.270 --> 05:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
program um essentially we're saying to
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
that Ace Hardware operator who's just
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
going to have a cardboard Gaylord box
 
05:36:15.390 --> 05:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
there where paint cans are going to be
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
stored as long as he's responsible about
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
that he's not you know uh storing it
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
next to a a furnace or something you
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
know you're creating some kind of a
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
hazard long as he observes basic
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
principles of safe storage he's not
 
05:36:29.548 --> 05:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
going to be subject he's not going to be
 
05:36:31.548 --> 05:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
treated like he's a manufacturer that
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
generates a lot of hazardous waste he
 
05:36:36.030 --> 05:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
can just comply with basic requirements
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
of safety and then but then when that g
 
05:36:40.030 --> 05:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
when that transporter comes in to pick
 
05:36:42.030 --> 05:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
up those wastes they're typically going
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be a licensed Haz waste transporter
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
because they're consolidating all that
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're may be making a pickup at 10 Ace
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hardwares that day and they're going to
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
have I don't know 8,000 pounds of you
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
know some of which is going to be uh
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
oilbased paints or or or other paint
 
05:36:59.470 --> 05:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
products that could pose a flammability
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hazard we want those folks to be as we
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
always do now we already do now we want
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
those to be uh you know trained trained
 
05:37:10.070 --> 05:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
and and and properly licensed to do that
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
safely over the road and do you think
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
the state should wave the liability yeah
 
05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
I I I think this is something that you
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
know we we've
 
05:37:22.590 --> 05:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
been a paint bill of some sort has been
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
introduced in a number of sessions so
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
we've been having this conversation for
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
more in fits and starts for more than 10
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
years now that was something that you
 
05:37:32.190 --> 05:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
know we're Regulators that makes us a
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable when someone starts
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
talking about that but what we realize
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
is that if you don't provide that um
 
05:37:43.470 --> 05:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
liability protection the for good reason
 
05:37:45.230 --> 05:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste laws of the state
 
05:37:47.430 --> 05:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
are are similar to the federal Superfund
 
05:37:49.628 --> 05:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
laws and similar to other states they
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
have they impos strict liability on a
 
05:37:55.230 --> 05:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
generator or an operator of a site so
 
05:37:57.548 --> 05:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
what that means is is if you owner op
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
you own a site even if you didn't cause
 
05:38:01.948 --> 05:38:01.958 align:start position:0%
the problem if all of a sudden there's
 
05:38:04.350 --> 05:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
soil or groundwater contamination you're
 
05:38:06.350 --> 05:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for that and you can even be
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
responsible if somebody else did it um
 
05:38:10.708 --> 05:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
so it's a very strict
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
liability uh Paradigm in state law and
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate and necessary because
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have some hazardous way sites that
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
post some very serious concerns that
 
05:38:22.030 --> 05:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
would otherwise have no other party to
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
take care of them but the idea of
 
05:38:26.350 --> 05:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
telling the owner of your local Corner
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Ace Hardware that if he spills a drop of
 
05:38:30.548 --> 05:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
paint there because he's participating
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
in the paint Care Program all that
 
05:38:34.270 --> 05:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
strict liability is going to apply to
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
him that's a huge disincentive and we
 
05:38:37.990 --> 05:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
have nobody particip ating in the
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
program and it would be unnecessary it
 
05:38:42.670 --> 05:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
would be tanking what could be a really
 
05:38:45.430 --> 05:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
good safety program for no particular
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
good reason so that's why over time we
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
we got comfortable with this language
 
05:38:51.070 --> 05:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
and we think it's the right thing to do
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
would you be amable to having it only be
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
licensed hazardous people that handle
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
the moving of it and put that in the
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill um yeah I mean I think I have to
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
talk with some of my staff but uh I
 
05:39:05.548 --> 05:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
think that's the current the way the
 
05:39:07.948 --> 05:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
current law would work and I wouldn't I
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object to that I mean I think
 
05:39:12.510 --> 05:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
having a a a a a licensed hazardous
 
05:39:14.270 --> 05:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
waste transporter handling it makes
 
05:39:16.910 --> 05:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
sense yeah it is rules established by
 
05:39:16.920 --> 05:39:18.110 align:start position:0%
sense yeah it is rules established by
the

05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
department Keith thank you thank you Mr
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
chair um just question about the fiscal
 
05:39:25.468 --> 05:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
note it's uh 50,000 a year approximately
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund so how it any
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
oversight that you have to do for this
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
program how is it funded out the general
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
fund does it come from the
 
05:39:36.670 --> 05:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's fees my understanding is
 
05:39:38.110 --> 05:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
that as the bill is currently
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
constructed any cost that the state
 
05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
incurs to administer the program whether
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
that's reviewing the initial plan
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
conducting rul making or conducting you
 
05:39:50.590 --> 05:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
know compliance monitoring further out
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
is to be reimbursed to the agency by The
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
Pain Care Program that's the way that's
 
05:39:56.910 --> 05:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
what we really insisted on is that if
 
05:39:58.270 --> 05:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
that if the bill like this were going to
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
be passed State's costs well there may
 
05:40:02.430 --> 05:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
be some upfront cost that you know we
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
can't know what we incur until we incur
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
it but we would be able to and we have a
 
05:40:09.510 --> 05:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
a well defined and um established cost
 
05:40:11.310 --> 05:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
recovery program where we we're able to
 
05:40:13.788 --> 05:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
generate keep track of our time
 
05:40:15.510 --> 05:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
including overhead and including you
 
05:40:17.468 --> 05:40:17.478 align:start position:0%
know benefits and all the fully loaded
 
05:40:19.948 --> 05:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
costs and then sending out invoices on a
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly or monthly basis to those just
 
05:40:24.990 --> 05:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I understand the so that bill that
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about would go out to
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
this pain care program that's correct
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's funded through if we're going to
 
05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
amend the bill it's funded through
 
05:40:35.868 --> 05:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
voluntary means by participating
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers yeah I confess I'm not
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
100% clear how the bill is going to be
 
05:40:41.628 --> 05:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
amended so I I don't want to I'm not I'm
 
05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm qualified to comment on
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
that but as I understand the
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
conversation that's just taken place uh
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
paint care would administer the program
 
05:40:52.350 --> 05:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
through its its member paint
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of which there are many
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
and presumably they would agree on
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
some additional cost on each gallon of
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
paint to help defay their costs of
 
05:41:04.110 --> 05:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
administering the program including the
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
cost they need to reimburse to us so
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
just one last follow
 
05:41:09.868 --> 05:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
I just looked up a can a can of paint is
 
05:41:12.030 --> 05:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
like 60 a gallon of paint is like $60
 
05:41:13.708 --> 05:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
pretty expensive yes so we're talking
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
about potentially a 5% fee added to an
 
05:41:19.910 --> 05:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
already very expensive product if that
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
um $3 of if if that's what it is I mean
 
05:41:26.708 --> 05:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
I if a gallon is $1.75 then that's on
 
05:41:28.350 --> 05:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
the odor of I don't know what does that
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
work out
 
05:41:35.468 --> 05:41:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.948 --> 05:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
I see so I think it's less than 1% what
 
05:41:48.590 --> 05:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
less thank
 
05:41:51.708 --> 05:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
you and it's a free market because the
 
05:41:53.548 --> 05:41:53.558 align:start position:0%
paint manufacturer might decide not to
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
join the
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
program um I do see on the
 
05:42:04.110 --> 05:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
page four we have the annual report and
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
administrative fees language that's got
 
05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
massage here it is we're we're trying to
 
05:42:20.830 --> 05:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
streamline government
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
remember streamlining government I mean
 
05:42:25.230 --> 05:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
what's the report what would you tell us
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
how much paint goes in or paint go out
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
how much dollars do we need that
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
information I
 
05:42:34.590 --> 05:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't I mean I unless you can unless the
 
05:42:36.270 --> 05:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
department can make a rational reason
 
05:42:37.628 --> 05:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
why we need
 
05:42:39.468 --> 05:42:39.478 align:start position:0%
that reporting information but you know
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
as far as we're
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
concerned um you know we we don't need
 
05:42:47.110 --> 05:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:49.468 --> 05:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
that the liability disclosure is a
 
05:42:51.548 --> 05:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
separate section that that you got to
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
keep but it it was the annual report
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
that you know you know no it we're we
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
want to keep this we want to keep this
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
lean and mean you know we want this to
 
05:43:05.468 --> 05:43:05.478 align:start position:0%
be cost efficient for the companies to
 
05:43:08.350 --> 05:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
provide this product right well I I I
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
think that you know a lot of the
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
provisions that have been discussed here
 
05:43:12.350 --> 05:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
in the hearing I think are in there
 
05:43:14.788 --> 05:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
because you know we come before the
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
legislation a lot we we work on a lot of
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
bills we I think what we were everyone
 
05:43:21.548 --> 05:43:21.558 align:start position:0%
who was working on this the whole team
 
05:43:23.468 --> 05:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
were trying to craft a bill that would
 
05:43:25.390 --> 05:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that we often hear
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
from the legislature and one of those is
 
05:43:29.468 --> 05:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
oversight and making sure if there is I
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
mean however it might be done even if
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
it's totally voluntary to the extent
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be an additional
 
05:43:36.510 --> 05:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
price added to paint someone's going to
 
05:43:38.110 --> 05:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
be concerned about that a paint
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
contractor who buys 10,000 gallons of
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
paint a year is going to notice it right
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say is that a fair
 
05:43:46.350 --> 05:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
rep price and you know for example if if
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh if and I don't think they would do
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
this but if the paint manufacturers
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
added $7 per gallon to the price
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
someone's going to notice that and I
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
think the provisions in the bill as they
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
are right now are designed to make sure
 
05:44:00.030 --> 05:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's an oversight of that to say well
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
wait a minute it only cost you 75 cents
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
a gallon to administer the program but
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're trying to charge your customer $7
 
05:44:09.390 --> 05:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
so what's going on here and I think that
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
was the idea of the annual report that's
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of monitoring the fee I mean
 
05:44:14.468 --> 05:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
typically when we come before this
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
legislature if there's any talk about a
 
05:44:19.750 --> 05:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
fee the legislature wants the ability to
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
set that fee and control it they don't
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
want to they don't even give that to us
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
in Ru making we understand that um they
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
typically want the legislature tends to
 
05:44:30.990 --> 05:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
want to have that Authority and so I'm
 
05:44:32.110 --> 05:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm having a little trouble
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
following the conversation that just
 
05:44:36.070 --> 05:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
happened because it it's different than
 
05:44:38.110 --> 05:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
my usual experience before the
 
05:44:40.350 --> 05:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
legislature but that's so Mike you have
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
to admit that coming in front of this
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee has been a little bit
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
different than I always look forward to
 
05:44:49.230 --> 05:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
it but this is only your second time
 
05:44:49.240 --> 05:44:50.110 align:start position:0%
it but this is only your second time
come

05:44:50.110 --> 05:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
come
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
on and I'm sure you're shocked and Amaze
 
05:44:56.070 --> 05:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
what we did with the p and and in terms
 
05:44:58.868 --> 05:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
of how how we're doing with this is is
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
that that um we run on the on the theory
 
05:45:05.468 --> 05:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
that the marketplace will take care of
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
itself and so therefore that if the
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
paint in New Hampshire is more expensive
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
than in Maine New Hampshire Vermont or
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere nearby but I think all three
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
of those states are already in the
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
program so if we suddenly became more
 
05:45:24.430 --> 05:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
expensive to them then yeah they you
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
might have a question but then they'll
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
just go bu the paint there okay but in
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how if you monitoring that is
 
05:45:33.868 --> 05:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep them honest about what
 
05:45:36.468 --> 05:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
they're charging for the paint um I
 
05:45:39.030 --> 05:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
would think the the the
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
retailer is going to be the one who's
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
most conscious because the retailer if
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
they suddenly realize their customers
 
05:45:47.350 --> 05:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
are all going are going out of state or
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
going somewhere else to buy it you know
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to say is hey you know you
 
05:45:53.230 --> 05:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
guys are ripping me off on the wholesale
 
05:45:57.030 --> 05:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
price so um yeah I I would want you to
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
really look at that that reporting
 
05:46:02.190 --> 05:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and see how much of that
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
really you need to have if to try to get
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
it so there's no f note on this bill
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
right understood see how you can get
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
there that would be really great okay
 
05:46:17.590 --> 05:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:20.510 --> 05:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
enough anybody any
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%

05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:35.840 --> 05:47:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:05.840 --> 05:47:35.830 align:start position:0%
