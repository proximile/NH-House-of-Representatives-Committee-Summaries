howard

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%

uh get get going here um first up is uh
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1052
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i'll ask everybody who's going to
 
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
testify to please make sure on any bill
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
that you're testifying on that you fill
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
out the pink card and send it over um so
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
we have it
 
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
for the members one of the things i
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
learned in criminal justice yesterday is
 
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
these microphones if your red light is
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
on it could cause somebody else not to
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
be able to turn theirs on so when you're
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
not speaking please make sure that you
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone off because after i
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
think three of them are on the fourth
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
person can't turn their mic on
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
so remember when you speak if you push
 
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
the button on the right it'll turn it on
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then hit it again it'll turn it off
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
so you can uh so everybody can speak and
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'd ask all members when they're asking
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions or or
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's okay they can't find mine either so
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping everybody knows who i am
 
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.509 align:start position:0%

and testimony on the bill
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you distinguished chair and
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the fish and
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
game committee
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
i bring this uh hb 1052 in front of you
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
as a housekeeping bill uh requested by
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game when we clarified the
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
number of rounds allowed in pistols and
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
rifles and such last year uh there was a
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
request from one of the people reviewing
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
the bill at fish and game that we also
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
clarify what's been an uh
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
point of confusion among um hunters and
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether they could actually have a
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
magazine that held more rounds
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
or had more capacity for rounds
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
than was allowed to shoot and fish and
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
game has always allowed a magazine of
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
any size as long as there's only six
 
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
any size as long as there's only six
rounds

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
rounds
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
in your weapon
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
so this will be clarifying that to say
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
to hunters so they don't keep calling
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
fish and game or getting you know upset
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the field or hunting trying to hunt
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
down a five round magazine when they're
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
hard to find it'll tell them yes you can
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
use your magazine of whatever size it is
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
but you may only have six rounds in the
 
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.469 align:start position:0%
but you may only have six rounds in the
weapon

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
weapon
and

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
the fish and game officers will
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
obviously do what they've always done
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
which is check to make sure you're in
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
compliance when you're in the field
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative explain uh any
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
questions for updates i'll explain
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
so jim i'll have one i want to make sure
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
i understood what you said and i'm going
 
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase it and tell me if i'm
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
accurate or not um so this bill goes in
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
alignment with the bills we adjusted
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
last year where we cleaned up the number
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
of rounds in certain handguns and rifles
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing last year and
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill says that
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
i can have a magazine that may hold 15
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
rounds but if i'm hunting with that with
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
that firearm in that magazine i can only
 
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
that firearm in that magazine i can only
allow

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
six rounds to be in the gun for the
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of hunting and that is current
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
law and this is just a clarification
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill is that a summary inaccurate it is
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
correct um you know some people handgun
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
hunt and there is no option but the
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
larger magazine they still may only have
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
six rounds whatever that magazine in the
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
handgun holds
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
some rifles have magazines and they're
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
very old and there's no other option
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
available that can hold 10 rounds you're
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
only allowed six that's it
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.269 align:start position:0%

game as they were working on
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
navigating through this process of

navigating through this process of
establishing

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
a program and they weren't sure whether
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
they needed legislation or not at the
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
time when we were filing so we put in
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
some language that

we we found out isn't going to be
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what they need so there is an
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that the chief of wildlife dan
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
so my name is dan bergeron i'm the chief
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the wildlife division for new
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
as representative pearl had stated
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is to allow the department the
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct online deer
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
registration so we use biological data
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
that we get from
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
registration of deer to manage the
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
state's deer population
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
historically this was done through
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
businesses local businesses sporting
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
goods stores convenience stores the
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
current rsa did not allow us to do this
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
so this this bill would allow the
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
ability for us to conduct online
 
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.350 align:start position:0%

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative pearl
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
we need the ability
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
to be able to require hunters to
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
register their deer in person
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
this provides us with an opportunity to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
collect biological samples
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
from the deer more detailed biological
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
information so we have biologists from
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
the department who staff
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
we'll also collect biological samples
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we'll partner with other
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
a good example is recently this past
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
season we worked with new hampshire
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
health and human services and usda
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
wildlife avis to collect
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
blood samples to screen for coveted
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
antibodies and deer
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we need this flexibility to be able
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
to require that hunters at certain
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
points of the season
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
bring their deer to a physical station
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a public health emergency
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
at other times we could also require
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
that physical presentation of the deer
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
not just online
 
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.629 align:start position:0%
not just online
so

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
would support this bill as amended
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
committee representative spelaine
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you mr
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
bergeron for being here um i
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh assume one of the biggest reasons we
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
need that ability to require the online
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
the in-person check-in is to ensure that
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
we keep a handle on chronic wasting
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
disease and if there's any hint that
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
something might have come into the state
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to take
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
and require that will this allow us to
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
require it by
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife management unit
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
tier of the state and not just do it for
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
the whole state at a time so for
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
instance if we think chronic wasting
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
disease might be leaking in from vermont
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
set up to have those along that area be
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
the ones that have to do it in person
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
while letting the sea coast by maine
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
still do online checkout yeah so i i do
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the amendment would allow
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
for that flexibility currently for
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease we collect
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
samples through butchers outside of the
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
normal registration process
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
just to keep the registration process
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
moving quickly if we were ever to get
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
cwd we might change that though and we
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
might need to collect samples at
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
registration stations so i do believe
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the amendment that was presented
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
would allow that flexibility thank
 
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.789 align:start position:0%
would allow that flexibility thank
you

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
you
representative

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chair um
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
is there any concern that
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
if most hunters
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
switched online
 
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
switched online
that

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the check-in stations may no
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
longer continue to be check-in stations
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then when you want to have you know
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
you do this emergency closure hunters
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
are going to have a problem finding a
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
place to check in yeah so that is one of
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
the things that we're trying to figure
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
out we're trying to figure out
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
internally the best way to still get a
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable number of samples so that we
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
get enough biological information
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
we did go to online registration for
 
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
we did go to online registration for
turkey

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
turkey
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
kind of at the start of the pandemic and
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
still about 50 of hunters even after
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
about two years of that online
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
registration still choose to register
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
their turkeys in person
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
um i i assume it'll probably be somewhat
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
similar for deer um although you know
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
those i feel like those are internal
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
issues we need to work out
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of this bill more allows
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
us the ability to set up those online
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
systems but certainly there'll be things
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
we need to work out
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
members

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i don't see any
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
fees associated with this online
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
will there be fees connected with it
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe there's wording in there
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow fees to be set up
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay would they be comparable to what we
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
have they would be they'd be comparable
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
potentially slightly more it's tough to
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
say until we figure out what the
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
contract will cost because online
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
registration will be done through an
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
outside vendor through a contract
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
so so it will vary but it would be
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
what the current registration price is
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
now it would not be substantially more
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
than what it is
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative khan
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dan for taking my question
 
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh every year
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
the hunting season we hear that other
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
states are doing it why we cannot do it
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
you know from most of the residents from
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
main reason you just mentioned that that
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
you want to do a lot of data that we
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
need for future
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
why we cannot follow the other state or
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so um currently
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and vermont
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
both do what we're proposing to do which
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
is a combination of physical stations
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
and online stations
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
vermont just recently switched to that
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
completely 100 physical registration
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's no online option
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
most states that have
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
either a fully remote options for
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
registering their animals are states
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
substantially higher deer populations
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
than we do
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
so states like new york pennsylvania
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
where hundreds of thousands of deer are
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
killed in a hunting season in new
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire we estimate we have a total
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
population of just over a hundred
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
thousand we only harvest
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 000 deer a year so the data for
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire with our low deer numbers
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
is very important much more so than
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
those states that have abundant deer
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
god representative sam
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if my question is going to
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
be able to be answered by you or not
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay but thanks for being here good
 
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.149 align:start position:0%
okay but thanks for being here good
morning

00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
does the enforcement division have any
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
reservations about conservation officers
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the field having access
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
to the online deer registration
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
the colonel's here so he can speak to
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
that but i think i can probably address
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
so we've had internal discussions about
 
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
so we've had internal discussions about
this

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
again it'll be an adjustment from what
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
we currently do
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
but but again we've already started to
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
work through some of these issues
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
through our online turkey registration
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
so there is we can set up a system in
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
place so that officers can access any of
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
either through their smartphones or or
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
laptops that they all have available to
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
them so
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're working out the bugs to
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
make sure they get what they need um but
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
but that's certainly something that we
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
can provide them and they should be able
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
to access
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much for your
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak on house bill
 
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.350 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak on house bill
1230

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
1230
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no testimony i'm going to open up
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
for discussion amongst the committee
 
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
for discussion amongst the committee
members

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
you have an amendment before you that
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendment i drafted i drafted that event
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's amendment number zero zero two one
 
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
it's amendment number zero zero two one
h

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
um that amendment was drafted in
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
cooperation with fish and game as the
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill was originally entered um there
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
were some concerns um and mainly it was
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
around timing we were concerned that if
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
we passed this law today and it went to
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
effect in june this november people will
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
be looking for online registrations we
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
need to get fish and game time to get
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
all the processes in place and
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
everything else so the first thing
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see is we put a september 1st
 
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.029 align:start position:0%
you'll see is we put a september 1st
2023

00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
daytona to deal with next year's season
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the second thing we did was we gave the
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
ability for again there was no
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority that was granted
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the original bill so he gave the fish
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
and game rule making authority and
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
allowed them to be able to create
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
closures as we heard about today
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
that allows them to close a specific
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
zone if for some reason they want to
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
collect biological data for that zone
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
they could take it as an emergency
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
closure close that zone
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
and make everybody register manually so
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
to speak versus online and then you know
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
all other zones could stay online um so
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do the same thing we did in
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
that last bill this is sort of a
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill requested by fish and
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
game um i i'm going to straw poll it and
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
see if we have uh consensus to pass this
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill or to kill this bill depending uh
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is to pass as amended
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the with amendment 21. is there any
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
objection to doing that today
 
00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:34.789 align:start position:0%
objection to doing that today
none

00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the fee
 
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the fee
if

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know a fee to register a deal right
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
now it's a couple bucks
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
how are you going to make that payment
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
how are you going to make that payment
if

00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing it over a computer and you
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
credit card or anything like that i mean
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to look at an amendment
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
to put a
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
in the cost of the license
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that way there
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
when someone registers a tier online or
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
even in a physical location
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
that money is already
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just to clarify this
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
gives an option to either register
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
online or still go to a deer station so
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a credit card or you
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
don't want to use online process you can
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
still do that manually
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
that is correct as the amendment's
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
written and this isn't basically
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
enabling language who allows hunters
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
they can choose to still go to their
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
favorite deer registration place and
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
hang out and drink coffee while the deer
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
is being taken care of or they can
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
choose to just go online and be able to
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
register the deer so either option would
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
be available
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll just make a general statement
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
that in most instances across the
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
across the legislature we're enabling
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
more executive directors or
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners to set fees as necessary
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
and go through the rules process for
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
that rather than go through the
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislative process for that because of
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
i was just going to follow up on that by
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
we currently don't have any of the fees
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
for licenses in legislation they're all
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
set by the director and at any time the
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
director could add the registration fee
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
to the current license fees by going
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
through gel car and could take care of
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
that if he determined it was necessary
 
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.230 align:start position:0%
that if he determined it was necessary
but

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the popularity with
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
physical check-in for turkeys i think
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that's even more
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
popular with deer because people want to
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
have it weighed and there are a lot of
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
um lottery competitions at some of these
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
check-in stations where you sign up and
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
pay your ten dollars and then if you get
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest buck you get to take a 50-50
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
off the pool
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that play into
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
these and they're still going to want to
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
have it physically checked in i i see it
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
as a convenience issue for those people
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
who are not close to a
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
physical check-in station but i think
 
00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%
physical check-in station but i think
that

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to find a lot of people
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
still want to bring it in okay any
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um the only issue i
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
see with charging a fee upon license is
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
many people don't harvest a deer so now
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're paying for something that not
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily utilizing that's all
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so i'm going to go
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
ahead and uh close the public hearing
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
move into exec session on house bill
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
what number are we on
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
right well i do that in exec
 
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.470 align:start position:0%
right well i do that in exec
um

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
um
sorry

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
12 30. so we're in executive session for
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1230. i'm going to make a

one clarifying question um
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is allowed an executive

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
with the bill but with the amendment
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think if you look at the written uh
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
written uh presented by fischer gaines
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%

distinguished committee
um

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill forward because of
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh some requests from constituents
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
this is there's an amendment that you'll
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
find to this which is uh zero zero four
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
seven h which essentially uh fixes some
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
issues that were with the original bill
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
um that were discovered by fish and game
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
this makes it an entirely enabling bill
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
it also removes the fee that's charged
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
from being in
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
rsa to be
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
set in rules by the director
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
so that the director may
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease that based on how
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
the program is going
 
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.750 align:start position:0%
the program is going
and

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
allows for the director to
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
model this the same way as our licensing
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
is done so that there can be a resident
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
versus non-resident option in the fees
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
and gives them the possibility in the
 
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.669 align:start position:0%
and gives them the possibility in the
future

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
of selling these hike safe cards at a
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
shorter duration um and i'll just throw
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
out one example i have a constituent who
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
gets a campsite up in the north country
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
all summer long they have extended
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
family come throughout the year and
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
their extended family would love to get
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
a hike safe card for the long weekend
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
while they're here but they don't want
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
to buy a whole season and so if the
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
director so chooses he may be able to
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
offer an option for a shorter duration
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
specific time period for a hike safe
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
card in the future but again this this
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it completely enabling
 
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.270 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it completely enabling
and

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
it just gives the director the ability

page the two pager has an amended
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
analysis as the second page
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
but the first page is the same
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
there should be a one-page document it
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
says amendment hb 1323 with uh

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and the reason that they did
 
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.390 align:start position:0%
legislation and the reason that they did
that

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh was back in for some of you that may
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
not remember back in
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
2015 we had made
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the past 20 years prior to that i
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
had made numerous attempts to find
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
better ways more substantial ways to
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
fund the search and rescue program the
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
cost of that program was climbing
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically and there was no funding
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
source available i came before this very
 
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.109 align:start position:0%
source available i came before this very
committee

00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times it seems like looking
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
for better funding sources and you folks
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
all tried to help me get that
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of one of those bills 206 26
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
was changed a bit
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
the hike safe car it was suggested that
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
we'd come up with a voluntary card and
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
we'd give hikers and and climbers
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
people that were not hunters of
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
fishermen an opportunity to to
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to the system if you will
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
and to and to
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
help us cover those costs those
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
exorbitant costs that we were
 
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
exorbitant costs that we were
experiencing

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh history we average about 189 rescues
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the cost of those rescues can run
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
into the the uh
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars we were
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
always short
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh quite frankly we ran a deficit at the
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
end of the year when we went out when we
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
drew from the account to pay our bills
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
for that for each year we were falling
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
short some 200 000 pretty regularly each
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
year we would then go into the fish and
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
game fund which was license fees
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
sportsman's dollars sports men and women
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and we would pull that money out
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
to balance out that account i always
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
felt that was unfair because the
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
sportsmen and women were footing the
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
entire bill for this
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
so the hike safe card we were hopeful
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
would take away some of that it in fact
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
has been probably one of the most
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
successful funding sources that we've
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
had at the agency so in 2015 it's it
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
brought us in 74 000 last year
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
2021 it brought in 336 000 so for the
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
first time in many many years
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
hike safe covered that deficit and that
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm very happy about that we've climbed
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
every year 20 to 30 thousand dollars
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
in that program people like it they they
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to contribute
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
to it i've talked to
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine hundreds of people
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
and reporters regarding this because a
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
lot of other states are now calling us
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
to use it as a model to do in their
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
state i've never heard anyone ask for a
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
one-day hike safe pass they felt i've
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
had the opposite of that on numerous
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
occasions where people would would ask
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
that we charge more how can you do it
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
for 25
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
why isn't it more the idea of keeping it
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
low was so that we would encourage
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
people from all over
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
to buy it
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh i think you could price yourself out
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
of business quite frankly so i watch
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
this figure climb every year and i've
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
come to the realization of the or the
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
decision that it was a great
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh it is a great program the way it
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
works um to be honest with you i
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the amen the amendment that
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsor uh representative splain
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
has brought today to enable it
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
but i still stand pretty firm that it
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
works and i don't want it messed with
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great program it's one of the
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
most successful ones we've had and i
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to see anything jeopardize
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we put the fee in the bill there
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion when we when we
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
set this bill up
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
with senator bradley and house members
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
who initiated this and helped us get it
 
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
who initiated this and helped us get it
through

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we felt that putting the fee in the
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill would protect people moving down
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
the road that it would have to go to the
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislature and give everybody an
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on it rather
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
than do it any other way and that's why
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
that fee was included
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
if someone i've had people call me over
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
the three-day weekend thing
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-residents are coming up and what i
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
suggested to them is we have
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
programs in existence now that you can
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
get this coverage
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
residents can buy a one-day fishing
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
license for ten dollars
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want to buy a 25 hike
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
safe car buy a one-day fishing license
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
be quite honest with you it's a better
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
deal because you can fish and hike
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
without any charge so non-residents can
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
buy a three-day fishing license at a
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
cost of 15
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
so these things can be met
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
these coverages can be met without
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
creating a new program and every time
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we go back to our online vendors
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
like we're going going to do for online
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
deer registration and we ask them for
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
program changes we pay exorbitant fees
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
for that uh in the twenties to thirty
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar range to set these
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
programs up and hike safe we work very
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
hard to keep those costs
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
the administrative costs at zero or near
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
zero so that the money could go directly
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
into fish and game so many times we get
 
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
into fish and game so many times we get
legislated

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislated
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
into different processes and the
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
administrative cost kind of defeats the
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
purpose it ends up some of these
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
programs cost us more to operate than we
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
make on them hike safe that's another
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
place hike safe was successful on the
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
only fees that come out of the hike safe
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
money is the credit card fee when they
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
purchase it of 2.75
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
so 22 goes into the search and rescue
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
account and that's why it's been this
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
successful so i really don't want it to
 
00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:44.550 align:start position:0%
successful so i really don't want it to
change

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're very happy with it it's working
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
extremely well
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to see anything
 
00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:50.470 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to see anything
jeopardize

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
jeopardize
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
the future of it not when you're jumping
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
from seventy five thousand dollars in
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
the first year to over three hundred
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
thousand so we also are meeting with our
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
partners amc the national forest with
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
our new director executive director uh
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
exploring ways now to advertise it
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
better to get some kiosks out
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
so that people have better access maybe
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
at our rest stops to try and increase
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
this but we're moving slowly because i
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't want it to go backwards it's been
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
very successful so
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm pleading with you to leave a great
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
program completely alone that's what
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
needs to happen here so that's concludes
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
my testimony thanks for having me and i
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
will never forget that the chairman
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
called me distinguished this morning
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
when we started
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'll call you other things
 
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.390 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'll call you other things
later

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
um so colonel i have a couple questions
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
for you colonel jordan if you don't mind
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
so have you had a chance to read the
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
amendment uh i did zero zero five last
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
night this morning yes
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'm looking for
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
understanding so my reading of this
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
amendment it becomes just enabling it
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
does language doesn't change anything it
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
allows the program that you could choose
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
not to do anything and leave the program
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
exactly identical or two years from now
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
this would this bill would enable you to
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
say hey we want to do something a little
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
bit different and it would allow you to
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
adopt that is that your understanding of
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does it is my only
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
concern with it i think if people see
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
that they're going to expect that we do
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
it is my concern so if they see in there
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we're able to now create a one-day
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
pass they would put pressure on us to
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
try and do that
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't want to get in that
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
position i i feel like i could come back
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
here to do that if i needed to do that i
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
could come back to the legislature and
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
ask for the original uh law to be
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
amended the other problem that i have of
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
course as you understand i can't i
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
haven't had my commission voted on the
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
original bill they haven't seen the
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
amendment so i can't support it even if
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
i did support it
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
but to be honest with you
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
we prefer to leave it the way it is
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
do you then you are against this bill or
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're for it i didn't understand i'm
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
sorry i we are opposed to this bill we
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
would like it to stand the way it is all
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
any further questions for colonel jordan
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wish to testify in
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
oh let me check my guards here
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
um seeing nobody else i'm gonna open up
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
for uh committee discussion um
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think you heard my summary at
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
the end i consider this enabling and
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
future proofing language in the bill
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
that allows the fish and game more
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
latitude to do what they want in the
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
future without coming running to the
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislature for a change that they need
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
desperately and then have to go through
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
a one-year legislative process or more
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
depending if the bill is retained so my
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
my inclination is to be clear as i i'd
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
like to be i like the bill as amended i
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't like the original bill i do like
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended because it future
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
proofs fish and game and allows them to
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
take things under their own control
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
rather than the legislative process
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
just understanding that anything they do
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
under their 541 authority they still
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
have to go to jail car and get approval
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
so it still has a legislative process
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
not just a law process so
 
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
not just a law process so
um

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents uh let's happy to
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
listen to other members on the committee
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
to see if we have consensus to pass this
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
or kill this
 
00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
or kill this
representative

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one point that i
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
didn't hear discussed and
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i know there was a lot of discussion
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
over the one day or one week options but
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
there was not a lot of discussion over
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the exact same
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
rate charged for residents and
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
non-residents and that's one of the
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
biggest beefs that i've heard from my
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
constituents is that they feel that
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
non-residents are the ones that tend to
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
need to be rescued more often they're
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
the ones who get lost more often and
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
that the residents should have a
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
discount or that the
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
non-residents should be charged extra
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
for this uh insurance that they buy
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
based on uh the same model that we use
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
for hunting and fishing licenses uh even
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
as you heard colonel jordan say that the
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
non-residents does pay more for the
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
fishing license if they opt to go the
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
fishing license route
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that this being completely
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
enabling now allows them to analyze
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
at any given point what the revenues are
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
and whether they need to increase or
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
decrease and whether they want to
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
separate out based on the number of

the
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
aspect of the insurance that's being
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
bought so that a non-resident
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
resident would be required to pay more
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
than a resident
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
if that's indeed what they find in their
 
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.309 align:start position:0%
if that's indeed what they find in their
data

00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
we sell it like insurance but we're not
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
using any kind of actuary table to say
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
who are the more the people that are
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
more of a risk to the program and so i
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
think that enabling this allows them to
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
then look at their data and i would
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
really hope that everybody in here would
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
would agree that we can just enable fish
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
and game and let them go forward with
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
managing the program because it is one
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
of our most successful programs
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative khan
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
and then representative vegan
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman what i'm hearing from
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
colonel jordan
 
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
colonel jordan
that

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the program is working very well
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
why to touch it you know uh
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
he's the one who implements all the laws
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
we create
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
we we are not the implementing uh body
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
and his uh testimony
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
tells us that he's just he's a strong no
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's not um
 
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
it's not um
so

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm a little confused that how
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna vote i think that if this is
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
working why to touch it
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure and and i guess i'm gonna just
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
answer your question to a little bit
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
again i don't think we're changing the
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
program we're just giving options to the
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
program so the bro they could choose to
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
do nothing and leave the program exactly
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
identical as it is this bill requires
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
them doesn't require them to do anything
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
however it gives them the option in the
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
future to do something if they so choose
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
so i understand colonel jordan's concern
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
um again
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
my two senses i i think that this
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the program it just gives
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
options in the future
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
any uh representative you can go ahead
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh i have two points i'd like to make
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
one as a grafton two representative that
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
oversees franconia therefore franconia
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
state park uh this is a phenomenal
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
program that i do agree with colonel
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
jordan should not be uh adjusted i have
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
heard from a variety of my members uh
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me constituents who are also
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
members of the amino conservation
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
trust and the yamanuck
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
mountain club who
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
think that this program is running fine
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
as well as folks from search and rescue
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the region
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
fire police who volunteer on search and
 
00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
fire police who volunteer on search and
rescue

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and know the importance of the funds
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
that safe
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
hike safe brings as well i think colonel
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
jordan articulated that with a one day
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
ten dollar fishing
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
license and a three-day 15 fishing
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
license there is
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
affordability for folks that come from
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
out of state and visit for a day or two
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that as he said i think you can fish
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
and hike and be covered so i think
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
we do have a well run program that i
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.710 align:start position:0%
we do have a well run program that i
think

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
should stay as it is thank you sir
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative craig
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
and then represents shirtless
 
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.510 align:start position:0%
and then represents shirtless
if

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
i understand correctly
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
people can now currently buy a hike safe
 
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.190 align:start position:0%
people can now currently buy a hike safe
card

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
at a trail head by scanning the qr codes
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
buy it instantly on the spot i don't
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
believe you can do that with a fishing
 
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.790 align:start position:0%
believe you can do that with a fishing
license

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
so um you can buy a fish and license
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
online i know because i did it this
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
summer to take my son fishing so you can
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
go online and buy efficiently it's not
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
quite as easy as just scanning the qr
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
code at the trailhead but you can buy
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative sherlock
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i tend to agree
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
with the vice chair of the committee uh
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see the necess
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
necessary for this committee to pass
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh fishing game or the public if they
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
feel something should be done they can
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
have a bill filed it will take care of
 
00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
have a bill filed it will take care of
it

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
um to me it's somewhat like
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
coming up with a solution and now trying
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
to find a problem and i don't think from
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
what i heard from colonel jordan there
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
is a problem and so i'd be tending to
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
vote against it
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion the fact
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't sound like it's going to
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
be unanimous vote i'm going to just
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
action taken we'll take it up on the

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
cities and i believe this is one of them
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
i first want to explain how i became
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
aware of such an obscure law
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
just a little under a year ago
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
speaker packard placed me on the finance
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee as one of the members was in
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
deteriorating deteriorating health
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the very first things i had
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
to look at was
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
that we had in committee on finance too
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
was a change that governor sununu had
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
sent over regarding
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
damage by bears and mountain lions again
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i looked at that and i said what in
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
the heck is damaged by mountain lions
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
so the change
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the rsa they were looking to do was
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh they would
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
i guess you could say tighten up the old
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
1895 law
 
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
1895 law
but

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
as we are well aware you've heard the
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
term lipstick
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
lipstick on a pig
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what i saw this as nothing
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
more as they were trying to put lipstick
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
on a pig it was still going to be a pig
 
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
on a pig it was still going to be a pig
um

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
i did meet and or i did uh request data
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
and met with the executive director
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
mason on this and he was very
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
forthcoming with some data which i'll
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
there are two issues that i see with the
 
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.589 align:start position:0%
there are two issues that i see with the
rsa

00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
the first one is taxpayers should not be
 
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
the first one is taxpayers should not be
subsidizing

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
subsidizing
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
or providing insurance for damage by
 
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
or providing insurance for damage by
bears

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
bears
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'll get into towards the end it's more
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
of a non
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe for this committee but
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually raised the hackles on the back
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
of my neck when i started digging into
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
some of the data
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
so why
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
why are we using taxpayer dollars to
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
ensure a select group of farmers against
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
crop damage
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
now we do not and we should not pay
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
damage for other types of damage by
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife as an example
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
i used to own many hundred christmas
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
trees and every year i would lose a
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
significant not a significant but a
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
great number of trees to deer for some
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
reason they liked uh we have a lot of
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
deer on our property and we lose
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
christmas trees every year i had no
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
recourse to go to the state and ask for
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to pay for the damage to
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
my trees
 
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.990 align:start position:0%
my trees
um

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
livestock or other farm animals killed
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
by coyotes fisher cats or whatever
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse for that and there
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
um if a deer or moose
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
crosses in front of my car
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
and my car is damaged i don't go to the
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
state and say you owe me for the car
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
damage because it was a moose
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
or a deer from
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
from the state no we have auto insurance
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the farmers in this
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
state they accept damage to their crops
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
as being part of the business risk and
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
and have not submitted claims in fact i
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
have spoken to
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
at least one farmer who has had some
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
bear damage but didn't
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh file claim and like i say the vast
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh when i spoke with the executive
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
director scott mason uh one of the
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
issues we brought up was insurance for
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
crop damage and i asked if insurance was
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
in fact available for it he said yes
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
however it's very expensive
 
00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:40.309 align:start position:0%
however it's very expensive
okay

00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers should not be the backstop for
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
those who fail to have insurance or
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the discussion with the farmer i
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh he suggested that
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
here's something i would suggest if the
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
farmers as a whole believe
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
this is needed then i would suggest that
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
the farmers form and contribute money to
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
a pool
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
or cooperative one that all farmers are
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
required to fund
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
now my guess is those farmers
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
who do not have baron damage or who have
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
never claimed uh compensation for that
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
damage would be pretty opposed to having
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
being forced to contribute money money
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
into a pool that would pay for a handful
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
of farmers who
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
money for damage by bear
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
and just as farmers do not would not
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
probably want to do this type of an
 
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.309 align:start position:0%
probably want to do this type of an
arrangement

00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook to do
 
00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook to do
this

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
the other issue
 
00:55:51.119 --> 00:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
the other issue
which

00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
is part of this
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
i became a little curious as to how many
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
farmers and how much money was actually
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
being paid out on this so i sent
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
executive direct director mason a
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
request for data and he he promptly sent
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
it to me he sent data going back about
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
what i did was i started entering this
 
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.710 align:start position:0%
what i did was i started entering this
spreadsheet

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
and as i started to do this
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
the first time i did it i i set up some
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
parameters where all right
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
farmers who claimed it now this the data
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
i had again was only over an eight year
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
period it only went back eight years so
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to prior to that
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
um as i started developing these
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets what i found
 
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.309 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets what i found
was

00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
the first spreadsheet i did is i put
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
only those over an x amount of money
 
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.109 align:start position:0%
only those over an x amount of money
claimed

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
claimed
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
and those doing it say more than twice
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
in those eight year periods
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
then i fine-tuned the spreadsheet i
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
dropped it i raised the amount of money
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
and increased the number of frequencies
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
of claims
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
what became very
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
apparent very quickly
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
is over the eight year period
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
there were three individuals in the
 
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
there were three individuals in the
state

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
who every year during that eight year
 
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.510 align:start position:0%
who every year during that eight year
period

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
claimed a significant
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money from the state and the
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers now again my guess is if i was
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
good to go back beyond those eight years
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
i might find that those same individuals
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
were consistently claiming now there
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
were other individuals that claimed a
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
few times
 
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.430 align:start position:0%
few times
but

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
over that eight year period the the
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
winner in that category claimed over
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
thirty three thousand dollars
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
my question is why weren't efforts made
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the claims and why is every
 
00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:50.789 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the claims and why is every
year

00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
those individuals coming to the
 
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.230 align:start position:0%
those individuals coming to the
taxpayers

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
we know that insurance is available but
 
00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:09.990 align:start position:0%
we know that insurance is available but
individuals

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
in my opinion have used the state
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as their backup
 
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:24.230 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as their backup
um

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to talk about that
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
all right so inclu in conclusion the
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
scheme on new hampshire's overall but in
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
the scheme of things the overall amount
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
of money here being paid out annually
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to break the bank
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
but what it comes down to is the
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
principle taxpayers in effect are
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
funding insurance against crop damage
 
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:44.789 align:start position:0%
funding insurance against crop damage
for

00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
really a select few picking winners and
 
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
really a select few picking winners and
losers

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
losers
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the majority of farmers assume the
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
risk of damage as part of their business
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
which they should
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have an outdated rsa that requires
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
removal not updating
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
and though secondary to the primary
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
issue there is an apparent repetitive
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
repetitive abuse
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
by a select few that i believe looks
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
deserves further looking into and with
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
that i'll take any questions
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you to my fellow rep from from
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
stratfor county
 
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.390 align:start position:0%
stratfor county
um

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
bear somewhat different from the other
 
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.030 align:start position:0%
bear somewhat different from the other
games

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
games
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
species insofar as they're actually
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous to humans more so
 
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.670 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous to humans more so
and

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
when you this build doesn't just
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
so when you eliminate this 207 23a
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're also taking away a chapter from
 
00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.069 align:start position:0%
you're also taking away a chapter from
uh

00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
2207 222 a which
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
says um
 
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.030 align:start position:0%
says um
they

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
unless you take uh take steps to
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate conflicts between humans and
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
bears on your property you you're only
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to one payment for damage so um
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
will we be losing something in public
 
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.290 align:start position:0%
safety without this incentive for
 
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.710 align:start position:0%
safety without this incentive for
[Music]

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
farmers and
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
other residents
 
01:00:11.359 --> 01:00:12.630 align:start position:0%
other residents
to

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
do what they have to do to uh
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
make their property less attractive to
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
bears and reduce the number of uh bare
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
human interactions
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i'm understanding
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
your question are you
 
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.430 align:start position:0%
your question are you
remember

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're striking uh some language that
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
says any person receive payment pursuant
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
to this rsa do you want to eliminate
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
shall forfeit the right to receive
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
payment in a future year or growing
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
season unless such person implements
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
measures to prevent or mitigate future
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts and barriers that have been
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
recommended in
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
writing by the uh executive director or
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
agent of fish and games so correct
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
so it seems like these payments are
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
an incentive
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
to the farmer to you know take
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
various measures which most of which are
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
common sense but not everybody does such
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
as securing your garbage and so forth um
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'm still a little fuzzy on the question
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes it does
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
say that they should take care of
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors and they basically
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
say if they
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
claim it one year
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah they have to mitigate it the
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
following year is that which yeah so is
 
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
following year is that which yeah so is
that

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:26.710 align:start position:0%
that
so

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
there may
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
so uh that seems like
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like a potentially good policy
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
role sort of telling the farmer you know
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
like so the executive i assume fish and
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
game will come over questions mr horgan
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you okay i just thought okay
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much uh
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.109 align:start position:0%
the
paragraph

01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
the previous representative was
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
is completely struck from your bill
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
as introduced that's correct
 
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
as introduced that's correct
um

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to ask you
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
why you would oppose
 
01:02:14.559 --> 01:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
why you would oppose
payments

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody has
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
it basically goes back to the very
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
beginning i don't believe the taxpayers
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
under any circumstance should be paying
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
insurance or
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of a business risk
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
any further representative johnson
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question and
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
bear with me
so

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
based on what you had given us about the
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
data you collected
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
you said that there were three people
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
over this eight eight year period that
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
two of the individuals claimed every
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
single year
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the eight years of data i got one
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
individual there was one
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle of that eight year spread
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
there was no data for that so i don't
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if he did or did not but at
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
least seven out of the eight
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
and then there were several other
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that claimed multiple times
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
okay so
[Music]

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
then what you're saying is
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is these
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
individuals still did not do whatever
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the bearer issue and still
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
made claims
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm getting
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
that would be my assumption okay so the
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have paid sorry follow-up so
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have paid for this and
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
they still have not done what they
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
should be doing based on the rsa
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
that would be my interpretation okay
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure i understood that
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is all new to me on some of these
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
so representative johnson just to be
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
clear because i want to make sure i
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
heard a little misstatement in there so
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear
 
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.270 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear
that

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this program fish
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
and game would recommend the mitigating
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors here's what you need
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
to do if you want to get the pavement
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
again if they don't do that then they're
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
not entitled to payment again that's the
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
way the current law is written
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that's correct um thank you
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would say on that paragraph
 
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
i would say on that paragraph
um

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
it basically would in my opinion would
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
give the farmer
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
one final chance
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
to get it correct otherwise he would no
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
longer be
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
eligible i would also say that by
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
eliminating the rsa right now they're
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
getting that that same notice that
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate or you won't be getting payment
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:57.349 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
turcotte

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
next up is the department dan bergeron
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lang members of
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
the house fish and game and marine
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
resources committee um thank you for
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify before you today
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
um so i'm testifying on behalf of the
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
department and the commission
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
who who are looking to oppose this bill
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i'll go through my testimony and i
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
might be able to clarify some of the
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the barrett damage compensation
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
payments um are not
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
unique to new hampshire um so there's a
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
number of other states that have similar
 
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:42.549 align:start position:0%
number of other states that have similar
programs

01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
for example pennsylvania maryland
 
01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
for example pennsylvania maryland
delaware

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
west virginia wisconsin
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
some canadian provinces as well the the
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
is to be able to compensate farmers but
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
also to promote the value of bears on
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
the landscape and also foster an
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
appreciation and tolerance towards bears
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
bears are a very valuable resource in
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
to both consumptive and non-consumptive
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
users in 2021 alone bear license sales
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
generated over 240 000 for the
 
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
generated over 240 000 for the
department

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
and that money goes towards directly
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
towards fair management research
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
it goes to a conflict abatement program
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
that department runs that specifically
 
01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.470 align:start position:0%
that department runs that specifically
addresses

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
bear conflicts including agricultural
 
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.630 align:start position:0%
bear conflicts including agricultural
conflicts

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's recognized however that bears do
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
have the ability to cause damage
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes that damage can be
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
severe and as a result oftentimes
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
people's tolerance
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
and understanding of bear behavior can
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
but the department feels this program is
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
critical in offsetting losses to
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural growers and safeguarding
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
the state's bear population
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
so removal of the program would likely
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
result in a few things it would likely
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
result in agricultural growers using
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
more lethal removal of bears because
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
there's a current rsa that allows
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
individuals to protect their property so
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
without the damage payments it's likely
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
that that would increase quite a bit
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
it would also likely create conflict
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
between growers in the department
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
and and cause bears to become devalued
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the end result would likely be no
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
significant changes in damage to crops
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
dead and wasted bears because bears that
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
are typically bears that are taken and
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
as a result of conflict are not utilized
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
particularly depending on the time of
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
year that that happens
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
and again strained relationships between
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
landowners in the department
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the current rsa
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned was previously amended
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
this was in an effort to keep it more
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with the original intent
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
which was to provide financial relief to
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
agricultural growers
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
who are dependent on this for their
 
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.710 align:start position:0%
who are dependent on this for their
livelihood

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
the department had seen an increasing
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
trend in what we'd call hobby farmers uh
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
that we're submitting claims so people
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
that might have a few backyard chickens
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
and beehives
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
things like that we had concerns that
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
that would erode the intent of what the
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
original rsa was
 
01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:16.470 align:start position:0%
original rsa was
um

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and as was mentioned with those
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendments we established some
 
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.829 align:start position:0%
amendments we established some
thresholds

01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
certain income levels that farmers had
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
to receive from their agricultural crops
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
and also certain levels of damage that
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
had to be
met

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
bear damage that had to be met before we
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
would consider payment and before you
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
would qualify
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
so this program um with these amendments
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
that took place and i think it was 2021
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
so this is all relatively new our our
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
feeling is that this should reduce the
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
amount of those payments um
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
the other concern would be if we got rid
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
of this program it would make it more
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for the department to work
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
with agricultural growers
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
to to try and recommend some of these
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
so bear damage payments uh they vary
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
considerably on an annual basis
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
although on average years they typically
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
range between 15 and 20 000 a year
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
statewide that we're paying out for bear
 
01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.349 align:start position:0%
statewide that we're paying out for bear
damage

01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
the bulk of those payments goes towards
 
01:09:23.679 --> 01:09:25.030 align:start position:0%
the bulk of those payments goes towards
corn

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
corn
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then to a much lesser extent to
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
beehives and then also livestock but
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
but livestock and bee hive payments
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
typically average around two to three
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year so the bulk of
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is for corn damage
 
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
this is for corn damage
um

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
differences between how we deal with
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
damage by different species
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
bears probably
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
at least on an individual crop
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
cause very substantial damage we have
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
other programs
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
to mitigate damage for deer we have
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
depredation permits that can be used for
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
deer and other species we also have
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
those for bear and we do issue those
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
but but to somewhat of a lesser extent
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
so so we believe this program it
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
provides incentives
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
for landowners
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
to work with us to try some of these
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation efforts it's also
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to protect bee hives
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
or or livestock typically they're in
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
confined spaces you can electrify those
 
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
confined spaces you can electrify those
areas

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to protect acres and
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
acres of corn fields so
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
typically the people that we see that
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
get these payments on an annual basis
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's not a lot of
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural industry in the state of
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire there's a select few
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
people and there's there's even a
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
smaller amount of people that have large
 
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.070 align:start position:0%
smaller amount of people that have large
agricultural

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
operations and those are typically the
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
people that we get payments made out to
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
because there's very little mitigation
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
that they can do to completely protect
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
those crops
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
one final benefit of this compensation
 
01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
one final benefit of this compensation
program

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that to take part in it the land has
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
to be open to hunting
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
so this is an incentive for agricultural
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
growers to keep their land open hunting
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and hunting is our is by far our best
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
ability to manage the bear population
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and really appropriate management of the
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
population should help reduce
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
these these damages going forward
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
and also bears that are taken during the
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
hunting season typically get utilized as
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to bears that are taking as a
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
result of conflict
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
so the department feels that the current
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
compensation program is working well
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
it provides a good compromise to
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate agricultural growers
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
who depend on crops for their livelihood
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
but it also helps safeguard the state's
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
bear population
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
so in closing i'd like to thank the
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i would request that the committee
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much mr chairman
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to find out is i go up
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
north quite a bit and upstairs i don't
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
know how you folks are but
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
the beer probably population up there is
 
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:16.790 align:start position:0%
the beer probably population up there is
booming

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
booming
 
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.669 align:start position:0%
booming
and

01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game is bringing up bears that
 
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.709 align:start position:0%
fishing game is bringing up bears that
trap

01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
trap
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the southern part of the state
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're bringing them up north and
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
they're releasing up in
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
columbia colebrook
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
west stewartstown pittsburgh
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
these people are really upset about it i
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
went to a meeting at the restaurant up
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
there in colebrook and there's about 30
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
people they're really upset the way
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're bringing the bears up north and
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
releasing them up north what are we
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
going to do about that
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
um we we so
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
conflict bears
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
typically we do not relocate anymore we
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
we used to relocate conflict bears
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a bear rehabilitation program
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
and some of those bears do get moved but
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have started to disperse those
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state more
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
as we as we get more um bears that we
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
relocate typically um travel pretty far
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
from where we relocate them because they
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
need to find their own home range
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
bears are fairly territorial so
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
we've done studies in the past on bears
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
that have been relocated
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
they they tend to move fairly far
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
distances and they do not tend to become
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
any more
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
prone to conflict than any other bears
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the area so we based on research on
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
collared animals that we've done we
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
correlation between moving animals
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
and increases in conflict
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
that said we have we have tried to
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of bears that we
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
relocate and typically it's only the
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated bears that were moving at
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
we found it's it's not very successful
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
to try and move conflict animals around
 
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.430 align:start position:0%
to try and move conflict animals around
because

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
survival is not very good if it's an
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
animal that has a history of conflict
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
that sometimes that conflict just picks
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
back up so the
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
by and large the animals that we move
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
now are animals that have no conflict
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
history they were orphaned as a cub and
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up guide i'm sorry
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
well you said research who's doing the
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
research on this beer program
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
um so it varies so
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of the research is done by the
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
department typically what we do is we
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
work in cooperation with the university
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's been a number of years since our
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
last cooperative research project with
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire but
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know we we tag all of the
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated bears that are released
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
and track where those bears end up
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
turning up whether it's in harvest or um
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
roadkill so any bear that is any bear
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
that is that that dies in the state that
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can get our hands on we get
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
information from
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's through harvest or vehicle
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
collisions through
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know found found out on the road
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
anything so we have we got good
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative khan
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dan for taking my question
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor's testimony was
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
that two or three property owners
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
abusing this program and getting the
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money almost every year
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
can you address that for the you know
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee please yeah so it it it is
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
true that there are probably a number of
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
individuals who who get these payments
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
on an on an annual basis
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
but again that that deals more with the
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
limited scope of agricultural
 
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
limited scope of agricultural
um

01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture on the landscape so there's
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
a there's a very few number of
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that have large scale
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
operations that that tend to be prone to
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
damage by wildlife
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
and including bears
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't characterize it as taking
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the program
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
um because we every
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
every damage claim we have we have on
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
staff a wildlife damage biologist who
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
goes out and reviews all these claims
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and measures the damage
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then and then calculates a
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
compensation amount
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we distinguish between
 
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
and you know we distinguish between
damage

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
by bears other wildlife stuff that may
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
have just been
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
damaged by wind or the process of you
 
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.110 align:start position:0%
damaged by wind or the process of you
know

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking the crops out so
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
we have a specialist that goes and
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
calculates the actual amount of damage
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's done by bears so i i wouldn't
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
characterize it as as taking advantage
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry just i'm going to do a quick
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that question
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
just keep it on track
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
but that same person do they offer
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
mitigating strategies if there are some
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then the person would be obliged the
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
farmer would be obligated to follow
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
those and before they could do another
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
claim yeah yeah so that person would um
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and again that's a relatively new
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
part of this because again that
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment was just made in 2021 so
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't but but we've historically
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've always recommended mitigation
 
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.510 align:start position:0%
we've always recommended mitigation
techniques

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
techniques
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
when available even before that was on
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
the books
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
this puts a little bit more
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
this requires them to do it now you know
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
typically we would work through
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative agreements with people um
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
and and again when possible
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
we always let people know that the best
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing to do is mitigation because it's
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
your best long-term solution
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
because you know wildlife moves around
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
if you remove a bear from an area one
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
year it could be a short period of time
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
before there's more bears in the area or
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
other wildlife species so
 
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.070 align:start position:0%
other wildlife species so
um

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that answers thank you that's
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.149 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
uh
representative

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have one
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
question for mr bergeron perhaps perhaps
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
a follow-up as well
 
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
a follow-up as well
um

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you say that the sale
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
of beer hunting
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
bear hunting licenses
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
generate approximately 242 thousand
 
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.550 align:start position:0%
generate approximately 242 thousand
dollars

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
and some of that's used for management
 
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
and some of that's used for management
research

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
as well as a conflict abatement program
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
does that include any compensation
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
that that does not include compensation
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
so what that program is is we hire what
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
are called bear technicians
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and those people are hired typically
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
during the busiest times when we have
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
bear conflict so
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
spring summer and early fall
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
and those individuals
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
respond directly to any bear conflicts
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know it it can be agricultural
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
related um typically our wildlife damage
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
specialist deals with the agricultural
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
work but sometimes our bear techs will
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
assist with that as well um but you know
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's bears getting into dumpsters it's
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
bears at
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bird feeders and chicken coops
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
and really it's a it's it's someone who
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
goes out we can lend equipment to people
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
we can lend electric fencing we also
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
work cooperatively with usda wildlife
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
services who also hires bear technicians
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
um to assist with these things
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so we do
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
substantial mitigation work with bears
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the year um and
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
and that is funded through those license
 
01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
and that is funded through those license
sales

01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
sales
um

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
none of that money goes to damage
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement payments though
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um i no longer have a
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative love you're recognized
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
for a question and if necessary one
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
does the department uh keep a list of um
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
farms that uh that could be readily
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
available to hunters in order to to to
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
keep the beer population down in these
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
problem areas
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so we we don't keep a list um it's
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult to do that
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
because there's privacy issues with with
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
sending out information
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
um typically
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
particularly with the farms that
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
experience damage on a routine basis
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's i i think most of those farmers
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
have plenty of people they know that are
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
willing to hunt the property
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and we can
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
another thing that we do is we work with
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
houndsmen for example um sometimes to to
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
try and haze bears out of certain areas
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
so um we can put people in touch we
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily keep a list and again
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's largely due to privacy issues
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
with giving out personal information
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith you're recognized
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
for a question and one follow-up if
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you mr chairman i just
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to back up to your comment that
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
most damage is due to corn damage
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
i would imagine the mitigation efforts
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
on a 50-acre cornfield would be quite
 
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.630 align:start position:0%
on a 50-acre cornfield would be quite
difficult

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
i.e you can't use an electric fence for
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
that what mitigation efforts are
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
successful to ensure that this damage
 
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't continue year after year
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
possibly to ensure that the same people
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
aren't coming back for compensation
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is very difficult the larger
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
the operation the more difficult the
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation becomes um
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
um in part that's why it's beneficial to
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
have that um the requirement where they
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to keep their land open to hunting
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
you could certainly have situations
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
particularly if you're out working in
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
the fields a lot that agricultural
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
growers might decide to keep their land
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
posted to hunting
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
so one of the good mitigation efforts is
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
to keep that land open to hunting
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
to try and reduce the population in the
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative spelling for a question
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
and potential follow-up if you need it
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr bergeron
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question what is the
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
current population of bear in the state
 
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.709 align:start position:0%
current population of bear in the state
oh

01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know off the top of my head i
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
can i can get that for i could have that
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
emailed to you by the end of the day i
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head what
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
what i warn people about with population
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
estimates though
 
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
estimates though
is

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
people are always interested in a number
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the thing to keep in mind is that
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
estimates are based off of a lot of
 
01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.189 align:start position:0%
estimates are based off of a lot of
assumptions

01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
typically assumptions that we violate
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
here and there so
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
when we use population estimates it's
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
more as an index as opposed to assuming
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we actually know the number of
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
animals on the landscape so
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
even when so a lot of species we don't
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
even estimate the population number we
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
look for
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
different indices to track change in the
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
population so
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
bear we do estimate a number
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
but i just i just hazard that you have
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
to take that with a grain of salt
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
because it's very difficult to predict
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
population numbers of free-ranging
 
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.510 align:start position:0%
population numbers of free-ranging
animals

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
animals
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
my follow-up to that thank you mr chair
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
would you say that the number for bear
 
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
would you say that the number for bear
is

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
more than our population for moose but
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
less than our population for deer
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
and as such we tend to protect those
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
bear from
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
having to resort to the depredation
 
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
having to resort to the depredation
option

01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.229 align:start position:0%
option
more

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
than deer
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's probably so in terms of in terms
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
of population numbers that's probably an
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment um
 
01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.229 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment um
the

01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.430 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have so the bear population has
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
increased over time and as that has
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
taken place we we have become
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh more
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
willing and and uh and and issue
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
depredation permits for bears much more
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
frequently now we actually um
 
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.189 align:start position:0%
frequently now we actually um
in

01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think it was 20 20 well the last time
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
we did administrative rules which i
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
think was 2021. um we changed our
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for depredation
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
permits on bears
 
01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
permits on bears
um

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
to make them more similar to deer where
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
people who use those can utilize that
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
animal before the animal it would made
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
it very difficult to utilize it so
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we did to try
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
and increase the number of people who
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
might use those and to make sure that
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
the animals get utilized
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
any other member
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
go to second round representative khan
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have a second question guide
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
mr dan do you believe that the property
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
owners where the property damage is
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
happening they can buy the
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
individual insurance to subsidy you know
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
in individual insurance to
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
support their damages so the taxpayer
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to subsidize this program
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um that i i don't feel like i'm
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
qualified to speak to
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure what the i'm not sure
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
what the costs of those insurance
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
programs are so i wouldn't feel
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable giving a
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you rep thank you mr
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
persuade thank you
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
next up on house bill 1201 is john
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
robert johnson from the new hampshire
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is rob
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
johnson and i am here representing the
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire farm bureau as a
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
federation's policy director
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
farm bureau consists of just under 2 000
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
family memberships and another thousand
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
or so
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
memberships business supporting members
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
such as that
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
and we are i am here in opposition to
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
the bill and i want to make it clear to
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
the committee that we do not see it as
 
01:25:14.159 --> 01:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
the committee that we do not see it as
unnecessary

01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
outdated and it's certainly not obscure
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
to those that are affected and it is not
 
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
to those that are affected and it is not
insurance

01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
the state is paying for damage
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
damage that has been put on farmers by
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
the state's wildlife
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i think representative splain his
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
last question there touched on why
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
i want to go back a little bit um
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
back in the fall of 2000 we were
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
approached by
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
the uh by fish and game by the by the by
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
director mason
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh and we have and also by the
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
they had evidently received a claim that
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
they questioned it was a non-commercial
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
claim and i thought that the law needed
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be tightened up
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
and we understood where they were coming
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
from so we again we got together with
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
director mason at the time it was the
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
wildlife division director scott
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
ellingwood a couple people from the
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the commissioner
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
of agriculture and we sat down and we
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
hammered out the uh law that was adopted
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
by you as part of house bill 2. to put
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
some sideboards on the existing statute
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
which we agreed to
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
included and some of this has been
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously but it removed the
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
remove the mountain lion piece the
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
mountain lions i think usually we're not
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
recognized by that by by the department
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
it also uh defined farmer and it follows
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the federal definition which is which is
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
a a thousand dollars in sales of
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
agricultural agricultural products a
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
year or normally in cases of crop
 
01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
year or normally in cases of crop
failure

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
failure
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
it also define products as in line with
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state definition of agricultural
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
products in 2134-a
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's stipulated that damage must be a
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
minimum of 250 dollars at wholesale
 
01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
minimum of 250 dollars at wholesale
value

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we and we were the ones that
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
suggested it that there probably should
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
be some mitigation measures uh that are
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
were required within the statute
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
and and that was signed into law and
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're dealing with so as far
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
as the mitigation piece and uh
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative johnson you asked the
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
question earlier that that it still was
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
just signed into law beginning of this
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
year so what that hasn't been
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
is it will be effective starting now
 
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
is it will be effective starting now
um

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
with with
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know with those sideboards we we we
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
think it was it's uh
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
for those that are affected it's it it's
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
a it's a necessary statute um
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
i've had over the years a couple of
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
farmers and you mentioned i was
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
mentioning here that there are three
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
farms that have had to have received
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
payments regularly a lot of reasons for
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure you know the the bear are
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
they're they're bright they know where
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
the feed is
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's part of it uh there's it's just
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
that area is suitable for that habitat
 
01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.390 align:start position:0%
that area is suitable for that habitat
um

01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
most farmers this has been do not do not
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
put in for payments i i've had that i'm
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
remembering uh two farmers in recent
 
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.910 align:start position:0%
remembering uh two farmers in recent
years

01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh that have come to me and we've talked
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
about the issue and uh one of them
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
recently said to me that they had
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
significant damage i mean if you haven't
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you take a i've seen pictures of an
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
aerial view of a cornfield and the
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
bearer are smart they don't damage
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
starting on the outside they go right to
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the middle and they find a spot and it's
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's amazing it's like a huge spaceship
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
has landed
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
and it's just destruction
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
all around
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
and and and um anyway
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
one farmer said to me that
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is the he had been farming for
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
30 years and said this is the first year
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
that i had submitted a claim
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
and part of it was because milk prices
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
were low and the damage was significant
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
enough that it really affected him
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
and he had he had received damage yearly
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
up to that point and i had an again i
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
remember another farmer a few years back
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
who had said to me same thing you know i
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'd never have have put in for damage
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
but boy
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
i i had to this year it just got to be
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the point where it was affecting my
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
01:29:08.239 --> 01:29:09.110 align:start position:0%
bottom line
so

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not it's it's
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
most in most cases unless a farmer needs
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
it they're not putting in florida and i
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
want to stress again it is not insurance
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's actual damage to a commercial
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
producer who is feeding the state's
 
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
producer who is feeding the state's
wildlife

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair i think i uh
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think i'll leave it at that i'll try
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions but great thank
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
kurt
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
state director of the humane society of
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
we are here to
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
bear damage payments cost our state
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers an average of 27
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
400 but can be as much as eighty one
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars annually especially if
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
farmers and livestock producers have not
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
taken common sense steps to avoid
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
attracting black bears in the first
 
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.270 align:start position:0%
attracting black bears in the first
place

01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
while we are all concerned by this
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
annual cost this bill could
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
inadvertently incentivize the illegal
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
killing of black bears a species beloved
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
by most new hampshire residents
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
allowing this bill as written to pass
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
will impose other societal costs
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire fish and game department
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
would have to execute more law
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions which in turn
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
burdens our judicial system probably at
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
cost that would far exceed the amount
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
now paid in damage payments
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
the humane society united states would
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
like to suggest a friendly amendment to
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
because many conflicts with bears can be
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
minimized with preventive action we
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
propose limiting damage payments only to
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
those who have taken steps to mitigate
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
attracting black bears in the first
 
01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:35.910 align:start position:0%
attracting black bears in the first
place

01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
examples of these steps include using
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
electric fence around orchards beehives
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
and chicken coops and employing bear
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
resistant trash receptacles
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
a looming issue here that has not been
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
addressed is the state's wildlife
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
department permits hunters to bait
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
bait black bears
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
baiting wildlife comes with myriad
 
01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.430 align:start position:0%
baiting wildlife comes with myriad
problems

01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
including the poisoning of animals
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
creating sites where disease such as
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
mange or rabies can spread between
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
individuals and setting up small bears
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
for predation
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
most importantly baiting black bears
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
exponentially grows their population
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
beyond the land's carrying capacity
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and habituates them to people
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
ending all wildlife baiting in new
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire would be a great first step in
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
mitigating black bear conflicts in new
 
01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:31.669 align:start position:0%
mitigating black bear conflicts in new
hampshire

01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we call upon lawmakers in the new
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game department to
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
stop the practice of baiting wildlife
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
it flies in the face of everything the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%

thank you kurt any questions for kurt
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:12.229 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open this up for a quick
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst committee members
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
that was the last speaker on that bill
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
that was the last speaker on that bill
um

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
i'll give the chairs perspective on this
 
01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
i think we've heard
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of testimony about
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that this this keeps our new
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire land lands open for hunters
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
that the state regulates bears in that
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
absent this mitigation fund there's a
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
potential for farmers to start taking
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
bear out of season to protect their
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
crops as a mitigation factor rather than
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
take the uh
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
um rather than take the money so to
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
speak right so they can affect our our
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
herd i'm a little concerned about you
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
know again in the early spring planting
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
sows with with cubs and and
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
with absent the fun them taking you know
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
acting earlier and taking the bear
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so my but i also
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
response of the representatives close
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
comment about the
 
01:34:04.719 --> 01:34:05.750 align:start position:0%
comment about the
um

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
movement affair from the southern end of
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
the state to the northern the state are
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
moving bare into population areas that
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
are less wild which and open which are
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
by definition probably agricultural
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
areas um and we're
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're propagating the damage by by our
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
actions so my inclination on this bill
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
would be an interim study um and
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
so we could talk about the bill maybe
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
make some recommendations to a future
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
legislature legislator about uh
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
adding the mitigation factors and
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
talking about that give that time to
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
work and also to talk about
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
how this
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
repopulation or movement of bears are
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
around so again the chairs idea would be
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
to interim study this bill i'm open for
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
discussion to see if that's a consensus
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we can go from there
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
anybody wants representative spelling
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think interim study
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
is actually uh a good way to go forward
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
with this because i also like the idea
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that i would consider a
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
friendly one to the farm bureau would be
 
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:01.350 align:start position:0%
friendly one to the farm bureau would be
to

01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
make the first visit by a wildlife
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
conservation officer to inspect damage
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
be one to request and require mitigation
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
and then if the person does not follow
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
up with the mitigation if it's possible
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
we know that large corn crops can't be
 
01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
but uh if they don't if they are given
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
mitigation that they refuse to follow
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
then they don't apply and and cannot get
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the payout i think it makes sense to
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
give them a first warning of hey you
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
know you could have avoided this
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
let's fix this
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
and then if the bear still comes now
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
they can apply for their their payment
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it it keeps a balance where we're
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
not predating those uh bears just to
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
keep the crops safe thank you
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair thank you mr chair and uh
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
many members um you know my uh my
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
comment about having a a um a list of
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
problem farms uh would uh for me would
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
go a long way in this interim study um
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know if a farmer was that took the
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
money would would have to give out would
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
have to allow 10 people
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
or have his have his name put out there
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
for 10 people because baiting is a the
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
number way number one way of taking bear
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think if you've removed the baiting
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
from from bear hunting uh the the the
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
annual take could be uh cut in half
 
01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
anyway you know baiting in dogs and um
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know if you have problems with
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
something you have to bear that's you
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
know that's smart for starters you know
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
but if you have the problems with bear
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have to uh attract more hunters
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you put up a bait station
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's it's a at least a
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
weekly thing probably uh every couple
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
days you're you're back to re uh you
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
know restocking it and uh you know if
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
you if you live in derry and you and
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
you're hunting up uh you know up north
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh that you know a two-hour ride just to
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
go up and and rebate you know re-restock
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
your bait um you know we we can do
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
something with that thank you so it's
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're in support of interim study it
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
sounds like yes
 
01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
sounds like yes
representative

01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
i too would uh support an interim study
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh right across the border my district
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
from monroe is lying in the killem's
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
bear center which is a nationally known
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh program and ben kellum is nationally
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
recognized and i think it would be good
 
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
recognized and i think it would be good
to

01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
either consult with him or um through
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game reach out to him in better
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
better understanding some of these
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation efforts and i do um applaud
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
the idea that the fish that the farm
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
bureau talks about in terms of i think
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm paraphrasing you sir um
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
maybe folks that
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
have done mitigation and still have
 
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
have done mitigation and still have
claims

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.229 align:start position:0%
claims
can

01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
have their claim be more seriously seen
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
because they are making an effort to try
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
and curtail the problem so i would
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
support an interim study
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
if not it sounds like we're in consensus
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
for an interim study so i'm going to
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on house bill
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
1201 and open
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh executive session on house bill 1201
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i make a motion of interim study
 
01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.109 align:start position:0%
and i make a motion of interim study
second

01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%

warrants for individuals engaged in
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
fishing uh fish and game activities
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine will speak first
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like i'm going to have eight
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
cards because the distinguished colonel
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
jordan is going to bring me another card
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
so we do have eight speakers on this
 
01:40:17.119 --> 01:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
so we do have eight speakers on this
bill

01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and distinguished
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is i think
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
my third attempt at bringing
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
closure to
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
what i consider a serious loophole
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire law
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
and in this attempt i have an amendment
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you will see um zero zero seven
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
four h
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
which even further restricts the areas
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
where a search warrant would be needed
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
versus those areas where fish and game
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
can do their job without a warrant
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have and have always
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
had here is that there's a
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
simple line in our rsa that says fish
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
and game doesn't need a warrant at all
 
01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
and game doesn't need a warrant at all
ever

01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
many years ago we gave fish and game the
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct normal police
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
activities including traffic stops and
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
such and we never removed that
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
so my fear especially with the drug
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
problem getting ever more
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
critical in the state is that a vehicle
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
will be pulled over on 93 somewhere up
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
north fish and game will pop the trunk
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
find a pound of fentanyl and that
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
becomes fruit of the poisonous tree it
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
may not be then
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
investigated by any other law
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement division they turn it over
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
to it ends up getting thrown out and we
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
have to let criminals go free heaven
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
forbid that they pop the trunk and find
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
a body or evidence of child molestation
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
or some other
 
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
or some other
thing

01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's more likely that they'll find drugs
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
but that being said
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
i would like to close the loophole that
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
allows fish and game to conduct all of
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
their activities without a warrant
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
but still allow them to conduct all of
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
their fish and game activities
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
with their
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
suspicion and no warrant
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
so my amendment
 
01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.669 align:start position:0%
so my amendment
further

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
states and brings to even further
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
definition that if they have reasonable
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
and articulable suspicion that a person
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
is coming to going to or coming from or
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
actively participating in or has any
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
kind of uh game animal in their
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
possession that they don't need a
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
warrant but barring those circumstances
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
i.e they pull over somebody in a
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
business suit on 93
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
that has no hunting paraphernalia and
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
was not hunting they need a warrant
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
this would put them in line with all of
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
our other law enforcement divisions in
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state which all require a warrant
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it would ensure that we are
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
protecting the people of new hampshire
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
from a drug dealer who may be trying to
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
bring things in or worse a murderer or
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
child molester or some such
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it also protects the fourth
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
amendment rights of the people who are
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
traveling on our highways
 
01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
traveling on our highways
etc

01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll take any questions
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
i've done
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of re-drafting on the
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so it is essentially a
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
complete replacement that spells out in
 
01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
complete replacement that spells out in
detail

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
when a warrant is not necessary for them
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
and for what types of activities and and
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
gear and vehicles
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent questions
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine we'll start with
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative laflamme then we'll go to
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative close you're recognized
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
for a question and one follow-up thank
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spelling for
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
taking a question
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
in reference you reference stopping cars
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
on interstate 93.
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
current law does current law require
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
that the conservation officer have
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable suspicion
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
that a violation has taken place of
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
efficient game law before they can
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
just open someone's trunk
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
not the way we changed it to allow them
 
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.189 align:start position:0%
not the way we changed it to allow them
to

01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:09.199 --> 01:44:10.310 align:start position:0%
to
to

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
uphold all of our traffic laws and
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
conduct regular police activities that
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
was passed some 10 years ago because the
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
north country said we don't have enough
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
police officers around and we'd love
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game to be able to stop a drunk
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
driver if they see one so we expanded
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
their police abilities to include them
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
to stop people who are not engaged in
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
fish and game activities
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
and this is where i have the concern
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
when they're engaged in fish and game
 
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.109 align:start position:0%
when they're engaged in fish and game
activities

01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have any problem with the
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable suspicion as
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
the bar or them searching without a
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
warrant because that person
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
is engaged in hunting and fishing or has
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
been engaged or is carrying game in
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
their vehicle
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
but if they're stopping somebody who's a
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
drunk driver or such and they do things
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
without a warrant it can jeopardize the
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
case for any other law enforcement
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
division or the courts when they take it
 
01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:01.109 align:start position:0%
division or the courts when they take it
over

01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that i have no
 
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that i have no
follow-up

yes

01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know i'm getting really confused
 
01:45:10.239 --> 01:45:12.390 align:start position:0%
you know i'm getting really confused
here

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
a fish and game officer has full police
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
powers we shouldn't be making deals that
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
he can do this he can't do that he can't
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
police powers are governed very strict
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
when this committee
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
10 years ago we accepted
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
fish and game to have police powers
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
it was understood they would have full
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
police powers
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
as a police officer 27 years you need
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
more than just a you need probable cause
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
to stop somebody to begin with
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
and just because suspicion doesn't give
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
you the right
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
to go into somebody's car you need
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in one of the biggest
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
cases in manchester on probable cause
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
when i locked up all the politicians who
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
want four and i went to the supreme
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
court and that was on probable cause
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
not suspicion and that was brought out
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
so what i i would say
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
leave it alone
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
the police department
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
well the ceos have the police powers
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
they don't need nothing else and they've
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
been doing a pretty good job compared to
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
the old police officers that we have all
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'll get there is there a question in
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
there somewhere please
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
a question for representative spelaine
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
what's your question for him
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much since that was
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a question mr chair may i
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the question was so no
 
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.709 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the question was so no
um

01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative howard
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
the line says any
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
illegal apparatus subject to forfeiture
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
what would an illegal apparatus
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
be is there a definition in this statute
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
as to what a illegal apparatus is
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
i will have to defer that to fish and
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
game to answer what their list of
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
illegal apparatus are
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i could tell you that it is illegal
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
to hunt with certain types of uh
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
equipment and in fact we've got some
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
fishing regulations that don't allow
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
certain jigs so i would imagine that if
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
you were in possession of a specific jig
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
used for fishing that was outlawed for
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
fishing that that would be an illegal
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
apparatus um i imagine that if it was a
 
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
apparatus um i imagine that if it was a
um

01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
you have arrows that are tipped with a
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
broadhead that is not sanctioned as one
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the ones that's allowed that would be
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
an illegal apparatus but i'll leave that
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
to fish and game to answer more fully
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative love and then
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative sherliff wraps them close
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
can you guys turn your mics off so we
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
my question um as i read this i it seems
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
to me that it's um
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's just drawing a line between the the
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
duties uh when uh when a conservation
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
officer is is performing fish and game
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
duties uh the there's
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
does uh you know the the the problem
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
what is the reasonable suspicion is is
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
the rule and uh if they're doing regular
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh probable cause and
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's just drawing that line and clearly
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
defining it would that be right that is
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
my intent and this entirely is to make a
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
delineation between when they are
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
conducting hunting and fishing
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement versus when they are doing
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
regular law enforcement duties
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative sherlock thank you mr
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative um you mentioned about
 
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh representative um you mentioned about
this

01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
idea of an illegal search and seizure by
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
a fish and game officer
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
can you give us one an example of a case
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
being thrown out of superior court or
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
any court in new hampshire because of an
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
illegal search and seizure by a fish and
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
game officer
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
i do not have any information on that
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
right now what i'm hoping is to prevent
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
one from happening as we get more and
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
more drugs flooding in i think it's just
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
inevitable that one of the stops on the
 
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.669 align:start position:0%
inevitable that one of the stops on the
highway

01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
ends up being one where we have to throw
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
evidence out
 
01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.830 align:start position:0%
evidence out
follow

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
up wouldn't it be true if a conservation
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
officer was searching a vehicle because
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
of a fishing game violation and came
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
across some other criminal act that
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
would be a legal search and seizure
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh them performing a search as part of
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
their duties and finding another element
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
of a crime
 
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:32.310 align:start position:0%
of a crime
yes

01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:35.590 --> 01:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
i have one point jim i'm sorry was there
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else over there
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative oregon go ahead
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair and
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr representative spelaine
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
maybe probably possibly don't even
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
answer this but this appears at both uh
 
01:49:54.239 --> 01:49:55.030 align:start position:0%
answer this but this appears at both uh
this

01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
your proposal and i guess the existing
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
law as well also
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
seems to
uh

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
seems to treat
 
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.709 align:start position:0%
seems to treat
um

01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
fish and game related activities that
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
such that uh require
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
usually typically require a gun or
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
similar weapons as a crossbow separately
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
from fishing so
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
would there be any value in giving them
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
more latitude
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
to fishing which doesn't involve a gun
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i can answer that
 
01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'll take my one question here so
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
the the section of law that you're
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
looking to amend isn't revolving around
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
my quest and i'll get to my question i
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
just want to set it up um
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the section of law that you're you're
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
looking to amend to change the standard
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
deals with just their enforcement of and
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
i quote belief that any wildlife or any
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
legal apparatus is subject to forfeiture
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
is concealed upon or therein so it talks
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about enforcing
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing laws and not any
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
other laws and any other laws that be
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
subject to the regular police powers and
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
the requirements of regular peace powers
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that accurate as as you read the law
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
as it sits right now
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
as it sits right now it is blurry to me
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
as to whether they are
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
stopping a vehicle in their capacity as
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement officer or stopping
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
that vehicle as part of a
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
conservation officer or duty
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
it it seems to blur the lines by
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
just stating flat out currently written
 
01:51:32.639 --> 01:51:33.510 align:start position:0%
just stating flat out currently written
that

01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
no fish and game officer will need a
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
warrant at all and they only need
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable
 
01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable
suspicion

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
suspicion
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
if i may follow up some i want to make
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
sure i'm clear on this because under
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
those statute that you're amending it
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
talks specifically about
 
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.229 align:start position:0%
talks specifically about
um

01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement of fish and game laws
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
not dwi laws not
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
criminal not investigating a burglary or
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
stopping a robbery suspect or anything
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
like that we're talking strictly about
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that they would still need to
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
have reasonable and articulable
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
suspicion which is a pretty defined in
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement statement that they have
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to put it in their report and
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
for fish and game purposes
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
they stopped a car or
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
searched somebody's creole or whatever
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
they were doing but it was only relative
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the fission game if that extends out
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to the regular
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
police powers laws and rules isn't that
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think the reason that this is blurred
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
is because it wasn't until the 10 years
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
ago that we gave them police powers but
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
we never
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
changed this area that talks about
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
conduct of a conservation officer so
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
what we've done is given them an
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
additional duty and responsibility
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
without saying that when they work under
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
these it still falls under this other
 
01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
these it still falls under this other
area

01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
we have another area of law we've said
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
now fish and game officers may conduct
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
those stops but we haven't said but when
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
you do these things you need to have the
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
search warrant and you need to have
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
we just said fish and game officers now
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
can do this and then their
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
behavior and governance for when they do
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
things is still spelled out here one
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
last question i promise i'll let you go
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
um jacking dear right so again
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh a law enforcement officer over 10
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
years experience not uncommon someone go
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
out and spotlight a field looking for a
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
deer with a gun in their car and yet the
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
mere spotlighting of a deer doesn't
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
create a law violation unless you search
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
and see they got a gun in the car and
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're planning on taking a deer yet
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
that would only be a reasonable
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
suspicion standard so are we going to
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
give up on trying to prosecute jacking
 
01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.310 align:start position:0%
give up on trying to prosecute jacking
dear

01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
dear
 
01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
dear
no

01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
because if they have it says in the
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that if they have a reasonable
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
suspicion that an animal
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
is uh concealed on the v in the vehicle
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
that any game animal is concealed or
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the vehicle was engaged in any kind
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
of hunting activity which jacking would
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
still be considered a hunting activity
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
that they do not need the the warrant
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's in the amendment um and i have
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
now the information you were talking
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
about it is section 20626 that gives all
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh police powers
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
to the conservation officer
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
and that section
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
that i can see that they need
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
to follow all of the regular police
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
it does say they can execute search
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
warrants based on probable cause but it
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they need to have that
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
or when they need to have that
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions represent
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plain
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%

01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
meredith
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not wearing a mask today because i
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
had covert a year ago recovered and i
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
have natural immunity
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
my concerns uh i'm in support of 1091 as
 
01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
my concerns uh i'm in support of 1091 as
amended

01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
my concerns have to do with
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections of our
 
01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.830 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections of our
citizens

01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the statute as written
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
basically undermines as i believe
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
undermine certain constitutional
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
protections that we've long assumed
 
01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.709 align:start position:0%
protections that we've long assumed
exist

01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
requiring warrants
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
based upon probable cause for searches
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
and seizures and for arrests
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
i have a handout of some excerpts from
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution the bill
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
of rights the new hampshire rules of
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
criminal procedure and the u.s
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
constitution which basically
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
require warrants based upon probable
 
01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.350 align:start position:0%
require warrants based upon probable
cause

01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
the statute as it exists now
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
warrantless searches allows warrantless
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
searches based upon
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion rather than
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
probable cause a much lower standard
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
so it's to me this is a civil liberties
 
01:56:06.639 --> 01:56:08.470 align:start position:0%
so it's to me this is a civil liberties
issue

01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have four
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
major law enforcement agencies in the
 
01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
major law enforcement agencies in the
state

01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
we have our local police departments
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
we have our county sheriffs
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
we have our state police
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
and we have fish and game
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
there are of course other agencies that
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
do some law enforcement activities but
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
those four major ones the first three
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
local pd's
 
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.870 align:start position:0%
local pd's
county

01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
police are all governed by these
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional restrictions requiring
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
warrants based upon probable cause
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%

it seems to me in fairness to our
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
citizens if we leave this law in place
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
without the amendment suggested by

01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%

representatives
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um i'm just
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
curious as to why you prefer the bill
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the amendment uh maybe i'm
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
interpreting wrong but isn't it true
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
that the amendment actually broadens the
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which a warrant
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
i've only gotten the amendment just a
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
few moments ago and have not gone
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
through a detailed analysis of it
 
01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.109 align:start position:0%
through a detailed analysis of it
basically

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
i want to replace i want to see a bill
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
that replaces reasonable suspicion with
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause and warrantless searches
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
with a requirement for warrants if the
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
dilutes that standard then i wouldn't be
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
for the amendment before the bill is
 
01:58:51.679 --> 01:58:52.790 align:start position:0%
for the amendment before the bill is
proposed

01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
basically i want no warrantless searches
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
and i want to have probable cause not
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion thank you
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%

01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%

i believe house bill 1091 if approved
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
would restrict fish and game officers

from properly executing the duties of
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
their jobs into conservation improvement
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%

02:02:31.119 --> 02:02:32.470 align:start position:0%
game offices
routinely

02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
head out onto the ocean
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
to haul lobster traps to assure
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
compliance with not only state laws but
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
and if they're required to
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
obtain a search warrant prior to be
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
doing this i think it would be doing a
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
great disservice to the entire lobster
 
02:02:50.239 --> 02:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
great disservice to the entire lobster
industry

02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh as secondly once a boat is landed and
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
his lobsters get
 
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.229 align:start position:0%
his lobsters get
uh

02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
into a dealer's lobster pound
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
the way i read this law there is
 
02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:03.990 align:start position:0%
the way i read this law there is
they

02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game officers would be
 
02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.950 align:start position:0%
fish and game officers would be
prohibited

02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
from entering that lobster pound to
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
check that catch for compliance with the
 
02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.470 align:start position:0%
check that catch for compliance with the
laws

02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.510 align:start position:0%
laws
unless

02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
you got a search warrant prior to that
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i i i think that's just wrong and
 
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
and i i i think that's just wrong and
that

02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
the fish and game is doing a great job
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
in protecting the marine resources and i
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
think we should um
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
disapprove this uh amendment to the uh
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
the existing law
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%

i did prepare uh some written testimony
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read it verbatim um in
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
the interest of time i i wanted to make
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
a few
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
a few key points ellen if you could give
 
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
it to dan and he'll again pass it down
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is alan rice and
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of bedford new hampshire
 
02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm here in my capacity as the new
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire state director of gun owners
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
of america
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
which is a national organization
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
representing the interest of over 2
 
02:04:26.070 --> 02:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
million firearms owners
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
coast to coast
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of house bill 1091
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
i have not had a chance to fully digest
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment and i certainly have not
 
02:04:36.070 --> 02:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review it with our legal
 
02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review it with our legal
counsel

02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
um but the key points that we are
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
concerned with
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
is the fact that sworn law enforcement
 
02:04:42.639 --> 02:04:44.229 align:start position:0%
is the fact that sworn law enforcement
officers

02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
who are employed by the fish and game
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
department known as conservation
 
02:04:47.679 --> 02:04:48.870 align:start position:0%
department known as conservation
officers

02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
are able to search
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
and sees property
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
without probable cause
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
and without a warrant
 
02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.589 align:start position:0%
and without a warrant
um

02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion um which is in the
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
current law is a very low burden of
 
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.270 align:start position:0%
current law is a very low burden of
proof

02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
proof
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's an inkling it's a hunch
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's not very firm our attorneys tell me
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
that probable cause is known as 51
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
percent it's 51 percent that there's
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
some crime afoot
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very small burden
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate especially when we
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
local police officers deputy sheriff
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
state troopers
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
all have to demonstrate probable cause
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
to search
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
or to make an arrest new hampshire is
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
unique in that there's been a supreme
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
court decision state versus sterndale
 
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.030 align:start position:0%
court decision state versus sterndale
that

02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement does not
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
have the automobile exception
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
that other states have police officers
 
02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:45.589 align:start position:0%
that other states have police officers
can

02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
detain an automobile
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
and maintain the status quo
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
and then go apply for search warrant
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
but the current law has a carve out for
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
conservation officers
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
we don't think that's right
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
we are in no way in favor
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
of poaching or any other wildlife crime
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
but we're also not in favor
 
02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
but we're also not in favor
of

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
throwing away constitutional protections
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the interest of expediency
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
when i talk to
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
our members in new hampshire some of
 
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.550 align:start position:0%
our members in new hampshire some of
whom

02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
whom
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
hunt and fish they tell me that
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
these types of laws were drafted decades
 
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.470 align:start position:0%
these types of laws were drafted decades
ago

02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
when there weren't you know smartphones
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
and computers and cellular
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
communications and conservation officers
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
were in the field and the
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
the evidence would disappear
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's not the case in the modern era a
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
conservation officer in the field can
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
whip out his iphone
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
call the station
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
type out a warrant email to another co
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
they can get a judge to sign it while
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
the man or woman in the field is
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining the status quo and the
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
evidence won't leave
 
02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
evidence won't leave
um

02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
requiring cos to
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
obtain probable cause
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
and warrants would not only bring them
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
in line with every other law enforcement
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
officer in the state of new hampshire
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
would bring them in line with the
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
constitution and the practice in the
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
majority of other states and for those
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
reasons as well as what i have written
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony submitted to
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
this committee we would ask that you
 
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
this committee we would ask that you
vote

02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%

vote

background in law enforcement yes sir

reasonable articulable suspicion yes sir

02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
we represent approximate affiliated
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
membership about 50 000 sportsmen and
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
women around the state
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we have concerns of this legislation
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just reviewing the amendment this
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
morning but
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
our main concern is about creating added
 
02:08:35.679 --> 02:08:37.030 align:start position:0%
our main concern is about creating added
confusion

02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
into the work that the conservation
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
officers are doing conservation officers
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
are a specialized trained law
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%

sportsmen

02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
sportsmen
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and women are the
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know the regulated community here if
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the regulators being
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
the conservation officers
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
and this is not something that any of
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
our members have been asking for
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're confident in the current process
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
as it works with fish and game law
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement being able to use reasonable
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
and articulable suspicion for the work
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
that they're doing
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
are proud to partner with them in their
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
efforts in protecting hunting fishing
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
trapping as well as wildlife for the
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
next generation to be able to enjoy so
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
without happy to answer any questions
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
questions from mr baker from the new
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire wildlife federation
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative vegan you're recognized
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
for a question and a follow-up thank you
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you sir for taking my
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with operation
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
game thief run by the fish and game
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
department yes follow-up
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
would you call that a successful
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
operation that exists now i would say
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's probably one of the most
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
successful operations run by the fishing
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
game department another follow-up would
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
you be concerned that that operation
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:09:44.639 --> 02:09:45.430 align:start position:0%
would be
less

02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
successful if this
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill was to pass sure um it's definitely
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
a possibility that uh poaching could it
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
could be increase
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
we also have a
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the wildlife along the
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
borders wildlife don't stop at state
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
borders they don't know where they exist
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
both our partners and i'm happy to be
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
corrected by the department both our
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
partners in maine and vermont uh use the
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulate suspicion
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
definition when it comes to the
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
conservation efforts so um again we'd
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
like to see we wouldn't want to make new
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire an island in this case
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%

amendment to the law

that are highly regulated
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
that move around the seacoast and out of
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement would be inhibited
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
by enforcing the regulations that are on
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
the books now
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
they've got a good working relationship
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
with fish and game and with law
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement with fish and game
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%

members of the committee thank you again
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to testify today i'm i
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
too am looking at the amendment uh
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
kind of quickly this morning we the
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
commission didn't take a position on the
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment because it wasn't before the
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
commission so i can't
 
02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
commission so i can't
um

02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
i really can't tell you what the
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
commission would do with that i do see
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
an issue with it that i'll bring up here
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
in just a moment i
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
i always this so just a little update
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill or one like it has been before
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
the house on six different occasions
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
so in 2011 it was debated 2012 it was
 
02:12:42.639 --> 02:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
so in 2011 it was debated 2012 it was
debated

02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
debated
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i got to get to my notes to give you
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of those dates i believe this
 
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.910 align:start position:0%
the rest of those dates i believe this
2016

02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
2016
 
02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
2016
2018

02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we have had and i couldn't begin to
 
02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.189 align:start position:0%
so we have had and i couldn't begin to
guess

02:12:55.189 --> 02:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
i couldn't begin to guess how many
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
courts have reviewed this law and the
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
procedures that resulted because of it
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
that being searches that officers had
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
done cases that officers have made
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can tell you is i'm in
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
my 30th year for law enforcement
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i've been using this law for every
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of those 30 years so i'm pretty
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
confident that i know what it says and
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm also confident that we operate it i
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
operate under it correctly
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
and i would base that statement those
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
two statements on the fact that court
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
cases would show us otherwise
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
especially in the world we live in today
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
i can remember a time in the last three
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
decades where law enforcement has been
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
more closely scrutinized to the point
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
where i've got young officers who don't
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
even want to do this job anymore because
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of the public uh opinion
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and feeling about law enforcement today
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
so having said that and and to some
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
degree personally i don't think that's a
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
bad thing i think it's good that people
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
are watching i think it's mandatory that
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
we do this job carefully and correctly i
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a i don't have an issue with
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
that but having said that
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
i want you to think for just a moment
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
what would happen to a law that violates
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
routinely people's civil rights in the
 
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
world we live in today i would submit to
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
you this law would have changed 50 years
 
02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
you this law would have changed 50 years
ago

02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
50 years ago it's been tested and i'm
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to review when it was tested by
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
our supreme court on three different
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
occasions closely tested and examined
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it was upheld in all three of those
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
cases it's upheld in circuit courts
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
around the state and it's upheld in
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
superior courts around the state if
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
these guys
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
overstep their bounds they lose their
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
case folks they don't win
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the other thing i would ask you to
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
think about
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
when reach back into your memory
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
tell me when the last time you heard of
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
a fish and game officer violating
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
someone's civil rights when did that hit
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
the newspaper
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
when were those guys sued
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
when was the agency on the front page of
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
the manchester union or any other local
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
state paper saying that these guys
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
violated people's rights in 30 years
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
that i've been here not once not once
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'll read to you what confuses people
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
is 206 26 and i'd like to have my hands
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
around the throat of the person who
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
wrote it because i really think we could
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
have done a much better job
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a law that we spend days
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
instructing new officers on because it
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
is so
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
close to the line there has to be a good
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this law means and
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
i will i have sat in these chairs behind
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
you and heard miss statements and and i
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
did it again today misquotes and
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
misstatement saying that this law allows
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
for this or doesn't allow for that it's
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
very clear what it allows for it's very
 
02:15:39.679 --> 02:15:40.629 align:start position:0%
very clear what it allows for it's very
clear

02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so i'll start with paragraph two it
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
says to execute all warrants
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
so the idea that we don't have to do
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
warrants is untrue because that line
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
tells you that to execute all warrants
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
and search warrants based on probable
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
cause just like every other police
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
officer for the violations of laws rules
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
and regulations relating to all wildlife
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
section three serve subpoenas and i
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
won't go into the rest of that section
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
four carry firearms section five to
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
arrest without a warrant but based on
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
probable cause and probable cause was
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
was correctly quoted a few minutes ago
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
it is the courts consider that 51
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
standard that the person you're going to
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
arrest or that you seek to arrest has
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
committed the crime that's a pretty in
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
spite of what you heard that's a pretty
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
high standard you've got to be pretty
 
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:27.750 align:start position:0%
high standard you've got to be pretty
sure

02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
that that person committed that crime uh
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to arrest them all
 
02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:33.190 align:start position:0%
if you're going to arrest them all
police

02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
all police
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
game wardens sheriffs local pd's
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
part-time police officers state troopers
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire this is what's unique
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire all share exactly
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
the same powers
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
they are all certified police officers
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
we all attend the same academy i can
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
take this shirt off today throw on a
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
state police uniform and they would need
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
to do nothing to put me out on the
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
highway to stop the next speeder coming
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
down interstate 93. we're all trained to
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
the same level that's that's a good
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
thing ladies and gentlemen in the state
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire because when when
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh an event occurs or a major event
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
occurs and all police show up there they
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
all are trained they're all educated in
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
the same way it's very important that's
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
why i maintain that's why new hampshire
 
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.190 align:start position:0%
why i maintain that's why new hampshire
has

02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
fortunately been able to avoid
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
front-page news on some of these other
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
things that other cities have not across
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
our country i think it's because the
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
training level in new hampshire is
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
pretty good and and that's based on 30
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
years of watching it and and and doing
 
02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
years of watching it and and and doing
it

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we can arrest our without warrant but
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
based on probable cause for a crime
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's committed in our view if we find
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
out about a crime that has been
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
committed and we develop probable cause
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
but it didn't happen in my presence i am
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
required just like everybody else to go
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
get an arrest warrant or to go get a
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
search warrant there's no
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
that this idea that fish and game
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
officers have special powers is folklore
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't exist
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
what is unique to us and i was a police
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
officer for four years before i came
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
here so i stopped cars on the road and
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
it gave me a really good understanding
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
of of this law and how it's applied when
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
i was a police officer on the road if i
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
stopped a car there's a belief among
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
many people maybe some in the room today
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
that you must have probable cause to
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
pull a car over on the highway ladies
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen that's incorrect
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
you need articulable and reasonable
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
suspicion just just like a game warden
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
no different
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
when when i stopped a car i could say to
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
chairman lang chairman lang you were
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
speeding i'd like to see your license
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
he pulls out his license and his
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
registration ladies and gentlemen that's
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
a search
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's a search based on reasonable
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion i can't stop chairman lang
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
because i don't like him when i see him
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
down driving down the road and say give
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
me your registration your license i have
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
to have a reason to do that
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
no different than a game warden no
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
different than again i can't see someone
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
dressed in orange and say strip off
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
throw out all your bags because i'm the
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
mighty game warden's here and i'm going
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
to search everything you got i can do
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
that i'm probably going to get away with
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
it once and then i'm going to be in
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
trouble and maybe looking for work you
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
can't do that it's no different for
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
police it's articulable suspicion the
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
difference being and where people get
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
confused is we don't typically stop cars
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
on the highway we're stopping people in
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
the field or lobstermen on their lobster
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
boat as you as you've heard
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
on a lobster boat so if we i get ahead
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
of myself because i get so excited about
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
this because it's very frustrating to me
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know what bothers me the most
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
any time i've ever been to the
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislature is the thought process that
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
we've got game wardens out there
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
violating people's civil rights i take
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
that very personally because that is
 
02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
just not true not the case
 
02:19:43.359 --> 02:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
just not true not the case
so

02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
stop someone who is fishing so someone
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
is fishing i see them casting into the
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
water i see them catching fish they're
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
reeling up fish
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've reached articulable suspicion that
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
that person is taking fish i am now
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
allowed under this statue to go up and
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
ask them to produce their license and to
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
see the fish not their cocaine i can't
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
go into their front pocket their watch
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
pocket because that's not where you're
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
gonna find a fish okay i can only go and
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to justify in a courtroom
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
why i looked where i looked so if i see
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
a creole can i justify that in a cool
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
room that that's where most fishermen
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
carry their fish i think i could
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
if i start searching a guy's pockets and
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have articulable suspicion
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion or probable cause
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to win that uh the
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
scenario that that representative
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
spelaine talks about the homicide is a
 
02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.190 align:start position:0%
spelaine talks about the homicide is a
real

02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
and and and i want to stress to you he
 
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:37.910 align:start position:0%
and and and i want to stress to you he
is

02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
raising a concern that's real to him i
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
get that i'm not finding fault with that
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
but i
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
my problem here is i don't think he
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
understands it we in fact did just that
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
we were out enforcing fish and game laws
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the town of cambridge
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
this past year when we came across the
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
headless murder victim and the woman who
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
committed that crime or was partner in
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
that crime so we in fact walked in to a
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
homicide scene while conducting wildlife
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
work and i'm here to tell you there
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem with what we did or how
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
we did it because we were very careful
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we followed the law we
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
do the same thing as all other law
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement do does at that moment we're
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
not working on a fish and game case we
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
readily realize or suspect that we've
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
just walked into a homicide and those
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
officers took very careful steps
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
including warrants calling for state
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
police for backup and then worked
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
through the entire evening along with my
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
board director who picked that afternoon
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
to ride with a local officer
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
which is another whole story i'd love to
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
share with you all
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
they worked very carefully in that case
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
was of course it's a homicide it went to
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
superior court it was upheld the people
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
were convicted or at least one was at
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that exact scenario has happened
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
a game warden stopping when you award i
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
came back here a number of years ago
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
because my officers were coming to me
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
and it had happened to me we'd be
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
working night hunters in the field we'd
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
be coming home at 3 o'clock in the
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
morning and we'd come up behind a car
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
that was obviously being driven by what
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
we believe to be an impaired driver in
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
the old days if i pulled that driver
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
over which is what i should do to get
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
him off the highway before he hurts
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
someone i cannot or no one else can ever
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
prosecute him because i didn't have the
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
authority to do that i didn't have the
 
02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
authority to pull him over that was
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
happening a lot and so my options are i
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
follow this guy in hopes that he doesn't
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
kill anybody and i call for a local pd
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
or a trooper to come and stop him so
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
that we can get him off the highway
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's really i used to instruct my
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
officers that's not what i want you to
 
02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:36.550 align:start position:0%
officers that's not what i want you to
do

02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
our job is to get them off the highway
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
we lose the prosecution yes but to get
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
them off the highway before they kill
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
somebody so i came here and asked you to
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
give us the authority which the
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislature had never done prior to this
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i lectured my officers and i said it
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
here and i and i've got officer a
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
lieutenant here who will support this i
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
i beat on them constantly telling them
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
you are not state troopers i do not want
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
to see a game warden on the highway with
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
a radar gun okay we've got plenty to do
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
we've got all these wildlife laws that
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
we need to enforce if you see something
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
that is dangerous if i'm driving home
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
and someone runs a stoplight in front of
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
me i can now do something to stop that
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's the only time we use those powers
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
is in those scenarios i'm not going to
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
open a guy's trunk
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
as a police officer i know where that's
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
going to end that is just ridiculous to
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
think that that's going to occur if i'm
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to open his trunk i best have
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
probable cause and in fact a search
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
warrant and 206 26 lays out that i have
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
to do that okay it doesn't give me that
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
power or authority it allows me to make
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
that motor vehicle stop if you will for
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
the fishermen of the hunter that's in
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the field just like i did as a police
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
officer it's no different to say that we
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't do that is not correct read
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
section 7 says to to secure and execute
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
search warrants based on probable cause
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
you can read that to any police officer
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire it's
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing they have to do
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is no difference to that
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
finally the unique thing about wildlife
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
so people will say to me or have said to
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
me why why did the courts and the
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislature feel that that was important
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
to give you to give you guys the
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
authority to to stop someone under
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion articulable
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
suspicion uh and to do conduct these
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
searches and the reason for that was
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
really you can look at some of the laws
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
and rules that this very committee has
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
passed things like lead lead we don't
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
want lead in our waters we don't want
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
guys fishing with or gals fishing with
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
lead-based lures we don't want people
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
using lead shot and a shotgun we want to
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're shooting steel
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
shot not lead and polluting or polluting
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
our properties and we want you to do
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
that we want you to make sure that
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
people are doing that we don't want to
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have people
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen who you've heard
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
here in the back today who quite frankly
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
if there was ever a group who's subject
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
to these
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
inspections more
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
than than anyone else it is the lobster
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
fisherman we these poor guys back here
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
we board their boat sometimes twice a
 
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
week when they're out fishing they're
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
patient gentlemen they they're trying to
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
make a living with this they will give
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
us i've lectured my guys to get on those
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
boats conduct those inspections quickly
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
and get those boats back underway so
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
those guys can make their living they
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
want us to do that ladies and gentlemen
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do that and someone
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes out there and cleans up on short
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
lobsters or cleans up that resource
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
these guys lose money
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
so they're willing to tolerate that to
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
some degree so we have a good
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
understanding with them good enough so
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
they came today they're subject to these
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
checks and they're here telling you they
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
want to be subject to those checks one
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the laws that's important to them is
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
we decided as a legislature that you
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
cannot keep an egg-bearing female
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
lobster because these resources are very
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
precious to the state of new hampshire
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
in fact so precious when you created
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
that law you mandated that that lobster
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
can't even be kept for evidence it had
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
to immediately be released over the side
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the boat and put back into the water
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
i can't do that with a spotting scope
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
from 100 200 yards away which is what
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be required for probable cars
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
because if this were to pass i would no
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
longer be able to board that boat and
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
see that the only way you could see
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's an egg bearing lobster is to
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
hold it in your hand and flip it over
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
can't do that with a spotting scope
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
can't do that with a pair of binoculars
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
from a half a mile away
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
and one commercial fisherman said it
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
correctly you he could be coming in
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
from his days of fish fishing going to
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
the market and i would be powerless to
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
stop him unless i had probable cause
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
that he's gonna show up
 
02:26:37.439 --> 02:26:38.150 align:start position:0%
that he's gonna show up
and

02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
i got some good people but i'm not sure
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
they can tell if the measurement of a
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
lobster through a pair of binoculars
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's just not gonna happen and so these
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
guys are gonna get away with doing this
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
and and these are the gentlemen
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
fishermen that are going to pay that
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
price those are the laws you guys voted
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
through this is what you asked us to do
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
this is what i need to do that i'm not
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do that you need to
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
understand that it's going to change the
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
face of this dramatically
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause is a requirement that is
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the highest the highest of standard to
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
get these search warrants
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
then if i let's say that we're lucky
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
enough to take one of these poor
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen coming in and for
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
whatever reason i developed the probable
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
cause now i'm going to seize his boat
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to pull him over to the
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
side or take him in the shoreline and
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to seek out a judge and
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to write a warrant
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to have to have the judge
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
review that warrant and approve it and
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm fortunate enough i might be able
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
to do that over the phone but a lot of
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
times you end up trying to locate a
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
judge and hunting him down and bringing
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
that warrant to him then i've got to
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
seize the evidence whatever evidence i
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
seize i have to do a receipt i have to
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
file a return
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
the fisherman's day is over they're not
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
making money while they're sitting on
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the pier waiting for me to do all of
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
this as opposed to when i could board
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
the boat look and see he's got nothing
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
wrong and send him on his way
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you want to the
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
other factor that you want to consider
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
is our courts have never been in a worse
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
position than they are today as far as
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
workloads go they can't stay with the
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
work they're getting
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
adding this added burden to this
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh for any law enforcement officer
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
is is only going to burden our courts
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not looking to do that on the
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
rare occasion that we can develop this
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
so this law has been in effect as i said
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
for over 80 years and and in in those 80
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
years i wouldn't begin to guess how many
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
courts have reviewed it how many
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys have used it how many
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys have filed
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
motions to to
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
suppress evidence because that's what
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
would happen in these cases where this
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
law has been debated but i can tell you
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
on three occasions it's been debated in
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire supreme court and
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty confident that if this law
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
violated civil rights or anyone's rights
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
or violated the fourth amendment that
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
our supreme court would have taken that
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to change it because they do
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
it all the time thankfully i don't want
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
people searching me illegally either my
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
rights are just as important to me as
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
the people that i deal with so three
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
times that that has gone before the
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
court and i'm just going to read you
 
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
very quickly three quick quotes from
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
each one of those cases the first one
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
was state viva beauchemin which was a
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
baiting case in the state of new
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire with one of my officers
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
directly involved
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it and the court said under 206.26
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
one permits conservation officers to go
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
on any property outside of a building to
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforce wildlife rules and regulations
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
not criminal law not drug laws not
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
homicides wildlife rules and regulations
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
so he better be doing that when he goes
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
on there
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
goes outside of a building or to enforce
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
wildlife rules or regulation but does
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
not allow them to enter such buildings
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
without a warrant we can't kick the door
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
down on a home thank goodness
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
no one can do that we have to have a
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
warrant to do that this doesn't allow us
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
if permitted permits conservation
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
officers secure and execute warrants to
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
enter the buildings here the defendant's
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
porch is part of the property outside of
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
his home or his building officer brown
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
was therefore within his statutory
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
powers to go on the defendant's porch
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
and enforce all the laws and regulations
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
relating to wildlife it was pretty clear
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
what it thought there
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
state v marconi and i don't believe it
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
was any relation to my friend geno back
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
here if and it was gino you can thump me
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't i mean no disregard but but it
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
was a case on point it said we do not
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
read in our statutes any such
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing restraint on ordinary
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
patrol and inspection of lobster
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
fishermen nor do we find that the fourth
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to the united states
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
constitution bars reasonable inspection
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
of lobster boats under operated under
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
license from the state
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
and then the final one and the one that
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
makes me very confident that our laws
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire are good is i i
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
would argue and i would argue with
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
anyone in the room the most liberal
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
state in our country today is the state
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
of california now that's a pretty broad
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
statement some may argue that that's my
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
own personal opinion the state of
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
california took this up because almost
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
all the states across our country have
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
the same law or one very similar to it
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that's another
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
interesting fact it's not unique to new
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire it is nationwide california
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed this under an illegal what was
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
what was alleged as an illegal search
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
and they came down with the following
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
opinion it's in the state's interest
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
underlying a stop and demand pursuant to
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
section 212 which is 2012 which is the
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
california law is quite distinct from
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state's ordinary interest and
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of its criminal law
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
meaning it's different
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the limited category of persons
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
affected by the procedure anglers and
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
hunters are individuals who have chosen
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to engage in a heavy regulated activity
 
02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
that reduces their reasonable suspicion
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
of privacy with regard to the type of
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
intrusion it goes on to say we conclude
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
that the the intrusion upon privacy by a
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
game warden stop of an angler or a
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
hunter to demand or display his or her
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
catch is relatively minor to begin with
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
the stops are limited to persons who a
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
game warden reasonably believes recently
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
has been hunting or fishing a person who
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
have voluntarily chosen to engage in an
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
activity that is heavily regulated to
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
ensure the continued existence of
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
wildlife in the state for the benefit
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
not only of future generations but for
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit of current anglers and
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
hundreds themselves if we're talking
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
about people's rights the other thing
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
that i would ask you to think about
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state of new hampshire
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
owns the wildlife whether you shoot it
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
eat it
 
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't do that you heart you watch it you
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
photograph it we we manage dan back here
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
and his team manages wildlife
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
populations and does an outstanding job
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
for all to enjoy
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
and it's important that we manage we do
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
our part the game ones do their part to
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that this wildlife and
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
resources do not vanish
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
and if we're powerless rendered
 
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
powerless to check that that is going to
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
happen or is in danger of happening and
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think everyone's rights would be
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
affected then so i think it's just as
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
important to understand that this is
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
important for everyone not just the
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
fishermen and the hunters
 
02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:58.870 align:start position:0%
fishermen and the hunters
um

02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i could go on for a day and a half
 
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
quite frankly no i won't the other thing
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that that concerns me that that is a as
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
a matter of legal matter for my many
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
days in a courtroom i look quickly at
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
spelaine and i and i want to stress i
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
think representative splain has gone out
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
of his way to try to make this
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh i think he understands what we do and
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
how we do it i i do think that and i
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
think he doesn't want to affect that i
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
think he thinks i think he believes that
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is unconstitutional and he would be
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
dead wrong
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
so but he did try in an amendment to
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
make this a little bit better so we had
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
spoken about one of our concerns was i
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
said how will i stop someone
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
transporting a deer to a registration
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
station or or his residence i wouldn't
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
because it says he has to be
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
engaged in the act of taking and we have
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
a great definition under 2071 and for
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
deaf for taking it's chasing pursuing
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
worrying it's doing all of those things
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have one for just driving down
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
and transporting down the road
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the law this change would not allow
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
me to do that so people could load up a
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of illegal first transport them
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
for a commercial sale i wouldn't be able
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
to stop them to do that unless i could
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
develop probable cause i don't know how
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
i do that when a car goes by and the
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
trunks closed i'm not sure how we do
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't be able to do it
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
um he put in here that so we we talked
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
about that concern and he put in his
 
02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:21.910 align:start position:0%
about that concern and he put in his
amendment

02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
he added the word is returning so his
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
feeling was a commercial boat that is
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
already done with their take and
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
returning to the pier that would be okay
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
to search the problem with that is there
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
is no definition legal definition for
 
02:34:35.359 --> 02:34:36.550 align:start position:0%
is no definition legal definition for
returning

02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
returning
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
if i were a defense attorney the first
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
thing i would say is define returning
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
for me colonel jordan i'd be at a loss
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
to do that when am i returning
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
when am i returning there has to be a
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
definition for that am i returning to my
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
home am i returning to the pier what am
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
i returning from the required when you
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
put that stuff into a bill it becomes an
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
element of the offense that you have to
 
02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
element of the offense that you have to
prove

02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
prove
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
so you have to prove all of those things
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
that he's got there a talisman you have
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
to prove he was in the act of taking or
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
that he was returning to to wherever i
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how i do that i can tell you
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
right now you wouldn't you wouldn't be
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
able to do that so um so i'm going to
 
02:35:13.359 --> 02:35:14.389 align:start position:0%
able to do that so um so i'm going to
stop

02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
stop
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity and and i
 
02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.429 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity and and i
hope

02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
hope
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i'm going to stop
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a thing out in the newspaper
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's very sad quite frankly it's called
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
the lorry list we called it the lorry
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
list those of us in police work the
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
lorry list is a list of officers within
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
our state that have committed offenses
 
02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:33.830 align:start position:0%
our state that have committed offenses
it's

02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
disgraceful it's people that have
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
violated civil rights it's people that
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
have committed crimes it's people whose
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
truth or veracity has not only come into
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
question but proven to come into
 
02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
question but proven to come into
question

02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and those some of those police officers
 
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
are still working
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
within their agencies and we have 270
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
police officers on that list you will
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
not find a new hampshire conservation
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
officer on that list and i'm very proud
 
02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
of that fact
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i challenge anyone who says that we
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
are out there violating people's civil
 
02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
rights how we dodge that
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
i challenge you to show me that and i
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
challenge you to bring me the people
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
whose rights we've violated because i
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to see that because no one else the
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office none of our
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
courts no one else has put us on that
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
list and there's a reason that they that
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're not on that list so
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
show these people these officers that
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
you understand that and appreciate it
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
and don't render them powerless please
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%

02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
that was established and what went on
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%

02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:58.630 align:start position:0%
read
you

02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
casually mentioned
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
chapter 206 colon 26
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
section roman numeral v five
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh concerning and i'm gonna read it to
 
02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
uh concerning and i'm gonna read it to
you

02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
it says to arrest without warrant
 
02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
but based on probable cause an army view
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
any person found violating any law rule
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
or regulation
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
relating to all wildlife
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
take such person into before court for
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
trial detain the person
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
at the expense of intent you're a
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
certified police officer and i assume
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
that in your training you have
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amount of training
 
02:37:41.349 --> 02:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
concerning probable cause
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
and search warrants and how to interpret
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
laws am i correct in interpreting that
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
this section says
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
you can arrest without a warrant
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a rule or regulation relating
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
to wildlife
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
am i correct in interpreting that to
 
02:38:02.309 --> 02:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
mean that that does not apply to other
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
sections of the criminal code
 
02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:05.830 align:start position:0%
sections of the criminal code
so

02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
no we all police in new hampshire all
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement whether you're a game
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
warden a sheriff or a local police all
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
police have the authority to arrest
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh for a crime committed in your
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
presence without a warrant
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
so we all have that same power and
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
authority i think this law specifically
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
refers to wildlife just to make sure
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
that people understood that we too share
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
that authority but we could any law
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement can do that so a trooper
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
could arrest a night hunter eat and they
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
do on occasion in the north country a
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
trooper can if he sees a wildlife
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
violation he can act on it if i see a
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
dwi now thanks to this committee who
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
started it i can act on it so the powers
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
are all equal in in that regard it has
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be committed in your presence
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you were to tell me or i was just
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
would discover that you committed a
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor act outside of my presence
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
then i would have to get a warrant just
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
like a trooper a trooper or any other
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
police officer would so all police have
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
that authority quick follow-up
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i assume from what you're stating
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
then is that
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game uh
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
conservation officers do not have
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
special powers that police do not have
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
no they don't no i think the the 206 26
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
these first three or four paragraphs
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
convince people that we do it's
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
describing if you think about it it's
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
describing a motor vehicle stop the
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
police have the authority to make
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
without probable cause too articulable
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
suspicion if you were to if you were to
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
change the law for state police or all
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
police to mirror what we're trying to do
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
here you would have you would
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
essentially end motor vehicle stops they
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do a motor vehicle
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
stop because the idea of a trooper
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
getting probable cars watching someone
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
drive down the highway is probably just
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
as difficult as it would be for me to
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
watch a lobster boat from a fire with a
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
spotting scope it just you just it just
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
ceases to exist it's not going to happen
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
so this empowers us to make motor
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle stops of fishermen and hunters
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
and troopers and police have that
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
authority on the highway it's that
 
02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
authority on the highway it's that
simple

02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's that simple
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
for colonel jordan
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you colonel
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
jordan and i never get to ask questions
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
anymore so i'm so happy i pre-wrote my
 
02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.550 align:start position:0%
anymore so i'm so happy i pre-wrote my
questions

02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
look forward to that and i'm just i'm
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand some things i
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually have three but i'll ask in
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
between of the chair
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned uh that when you stop
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
and you ask someone for their license
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
that that is a search and i just want to
 
02:40:40.150 --> 02:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
clarify that's you requesting to search
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then voluntarily agreeing right
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as a warrant
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
search where
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
you are doing it against their will
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
although in a motor vehicle stop they
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the ability to not produce
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they could be charged with that
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
so so you're you're you are
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the court they view that
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's why so if i could just that's why
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning of a court case if
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
you can't articulate the reason for the
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
stop the case goes out the window at
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
that moment because everything beyond
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
that is thrown out
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
as it should be you've got to have
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion or probable cause
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
to make that start
 
02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.190 align:start position:0%
to make that start
okay

02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
and mr chair may ask another question
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
so and i believe you probably know the
 
02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
answer to this question is there any rsa
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
state rsa
 
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.389 align:start position:0%
state rsa
that

02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
requires explicitly that offers officers
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
get warrants regular law enforcement
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
officers um or is that just kind of like
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
an effect of the fact that we have the
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment and therefore such
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
evidence would get thrown out in court
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's we all have to follow uh this is
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
another misnomer we all have to follow
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
the same constitution we all have to
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
abide by the same laws and rules set
 
02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
forth by our forefathers thankfully
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
it applies to us all that's right and
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's where that we have
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
search warrant my that's why i brought
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
bob today
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
we have uh laws that that require that
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
but the basis of that the foundation of
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
that was uh was um
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
designed in the constitution or the idea
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
was born in the constitution yes
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it is you're about to read yes so
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
under under 200 excuse me 594.10 is
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
arrest without a warrant and it lays out
 
02:42:40.870 --> 02:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
those steps and that again would be the
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
same for all law enforcement don't
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
forget all law enforcement go to the
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
same academy we can we i bunk with i
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
when i was in the academy i bunked with
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
a trooper we all got the same level of
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
training thankfully okay and i have one
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
final question mr chair
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh colonel jordan i i've heard
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't ask you to
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
mention or speak to other people's
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but i've heard lots of
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
testimony from you and others about
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
the kinds of searches that have to deal
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
with lobster fishermen fishermen in
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
general people engaged in fish and game
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
activities um
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
but were those things not exempted in
 
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
the bill i i was under the understanding
 
02:43:19.270 --> 02:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:20.309 align:start position:0%
that they were
so

02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that's before you would would
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
not allow for any of that unless you had
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
probable cause you would need probable
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
cause for any of that okay the first
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
line of the change indicates that thank
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
you very much yep
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
any further representative howard
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
my question colonel
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
um it's back to my original question i
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
was just
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
wondering what an illegal apparatus
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
subject to forfeiture is
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
so under
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
26 we are allowed to
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's much like the drug law we are
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to seize things that are
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh used items that are used illegally in
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
the commission of a crime so if i were
 
02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
to stop a night hunter a person out at
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
night shooting deer i could sue i could
 
02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
seize his firearm uh theoretically i
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
could seize his car although none of it
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's never done
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but you can seize all of that stuff
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be used as evidence really is what it
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of that was for
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
so illegal illegal apparatus was kind of
 
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
so illegal illegal apparatus was kind of
a

02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a that was a word that
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
was written many years ago and has never
 
02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
changed but it but it means contraband
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
basically today that would probably read
 
02:44:32.399 --> 02:44:35.269 align:start position:0%
basically today that would probably read
contraband

02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
relating though relating to wildlife
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
follow up his life
 
02:44:39.439 --> 02:44:40.230 align:start position:0%
follow up his life
um

02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
well that's you know if you pulled
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
someone over there's a hypothetical and
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
they had lead jigs
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
in their trunk
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're not engaged in fishing they just
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
they had led jigs in their trunk they
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
would maybe bring them to another state
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
where they're legal
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
would that be considered an illegal
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
apparatus it would be considered illegal
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's illegal to possess it
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
am i right bob
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's illegal
 
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
so if it's illegal to possess it in new
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire you couldn't have it and we
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
would see we would only seize it if it
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
were illegal to be in your possession
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're at what your point you're trying
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
to make would be correct if they're not
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
using it and it's not illegal to possess
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
it no you would not do anything with
 
02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:24.389 align:start position:0%
it no you would not do anything with
that

02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and you
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i want to say one other thing i
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't open his trunk
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
until unless i felt i asked him that i
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
could open it and he allows me to do it
 
02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
i haven't i have no authority to open
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
that trunk unless i have a search
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
warrant you can't you know that second
 
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
third paragraph of 206.26 spells that
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
out locked
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
cars how homes all of those things just
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
like police you have to have a warrant
 
02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.670 align:start position:0%
like police you have to have a warrant
thankfully

02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
thankfully
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
representatives i recognize for a
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
question and a follow-up i actually have
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
a question for the chair first which may
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
qualify whether i have a question for
 
02:45:58.950 --> 02:45:58.960 align:start position:0%

testimony when it directly references
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
the commission fish and game
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
and a project that the colonel oversees
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%

colonel jordan the gunners of america
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony and i'll read it
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
specifically so i can be clear the goa
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
leadership was horrified when we saw the
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
blatant fourth amendment and fifth
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendment violations displayed on the tv
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
show northwoods law new hampshire which
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
focuses on your
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
folks hunter's forest blah blah blah um
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
hunters forced to walk a conservation
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
officer around a kill site and answer
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
these questions only to get summoned
 
02:46:36.479 --> 02:46:37.590 align:start position:0%
these questions only to get summoned
anyway

02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
was there any legal ramifications taken
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
against the fish and game department in
 
02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
against the fish and game department in
this

02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
person profiled in the program or was
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
the program do you know
 
02:46:51.439 --> 02:46:52.469 align:start position:0%
the program do you know
legally

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
legally
 
02:46:52.479 --> 02:46:53.429 align:start position:0%
legally
uh

02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
found liable for violating fourth or
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
fifth amendment violations yep so good
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
question so
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh we did a television show as you know
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
for 12 years i learned a lot more about
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
tv than i ever wanted to know i would
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
sincerely request that no law is ever
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
written based on what you see on a
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
television show
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
based on what i now know so television
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
is entertainment ladies and gentlemen
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that's purely what it is i debate
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
internally with my my film company on
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
many occasions over what to show and how
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
much of it to show they are in tuned on
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
showing the entertainment part the
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
sensational part the gotcha moment they
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
they failed to show that there were
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
months that went up into some of those
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
investigations or weeks and follow-up
 
02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
work and warrants done they don't show
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
that because quite frankly that doesn't
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
sell television the search warrant does
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
so so the answer to that would be please
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't do that and if you haven't figured
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
out our news is no better i've dealt
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with them for 30 years too so
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
and i know chairman lang has so it's
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's disgraceful quite frankly
 
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.110 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's disgraceful quite frankly
so

02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question we had one
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in the 12 years of filming i get
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
inundated with support emails and now
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm getting inundated because people are
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
angry because it's going off the air and
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm and i'm not too disappointed about
 
02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
that because it's a lot of work
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
so we get a lot of
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
way more positive feedback than negative
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
so we had one lawsuit in 24 years in 12
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
years a person brought that really
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
involved another police department that
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
we were we were assisting with they
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
called us in to assist the person sued
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
based on search uh via alleged search
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
violations it failed miserably
 
02:48:35.670 --> 02:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
not only did it fail he ended up paying
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney cost for the television
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
company so the judge sent him a loud
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
message that that was a frivolous suit
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
so we've never been sued there's never
 
02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
been an allegation made and i would say
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
to you that's just you know you're
 
02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:48.710 align:start position:0%
to you that's just you know you're
seeing

02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
one little piece of a very big picture
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
and and i would hope people would put
 
02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
that in perspective it's a television
 
02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
that in perspective it's a television
show

02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
show
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
i completely appreciate your point of
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
view and your testimony thanks for the
 
02:48:59.279 --> 02:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
view and your testimony thanks for the
question

02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
to colonel jordan's point i'd say any
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of us have been interviewed by the
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
paper and spent 15 minutes talking to
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
them and they take one sentence out of
 
02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
your entire statement and that's what's
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to be in the newspaper so and that
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
sentence has to be with their train of
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
thought they take what's what they want
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chairman colonel jordan
 
02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:20.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chairman colonel jordan
um

02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
try to ask a question in layman's terms
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
and a scenario type situation so if
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
there's a vehicle traffic traveling down
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
the road i.e in normal police duties and
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
he's speeding you're going to stop him
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
on reasonable suspicion correct
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
during hunting season on a busy road
 
02:49:40.230 --> 02:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's traveled by many hunters it's a
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
frequently traveled hunting area and
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman driving down the
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
road not speeding doing nothing wrong
 
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
but has camouflage on will you stop him
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
on reasonable suspicion so in that
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
scenario the only way that we would do
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is if that in and there would be
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
have to be a more mitigating faction so
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to be someone dressed
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
or appearing to be hunting someone
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
traveling at a slow speed which is
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
indicative of someone road hunting
 
02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
indicative of someone road hunting
uh

02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
you know searching for game from their
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle a person traveling down the road
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
at normal speed and camo gear i would
 
02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
not stop unless i saw some sort of a
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
violation is that a hunter yep it is
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
but i don't have articulate suspicion to
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
stop him i don't know what he's doing he
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
may be just driving down the road with a
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
camo coat on so i would not stop him
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up absolutely god if you did stop
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
that suspected hunter um
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
and you did suspect that he was hunting
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
but there was no visible signs of blood
 
02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
or a gun or anything but you suspect
 
02:50:34.630 --> 02:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
something's in the trunk would you
 
02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
require them to get a warrant
 
02:50:38.710 --> 02:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
i would i would first probably we
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
typically ask him if we think there's
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
something in the trunk and we have a
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
reason we we relay that reason to him
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i would ask him because it's simple
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
for both of us can you open your trunk
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
and show me that there's nothing in
 
02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
there and 99.9 percent of the people
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
will do just that if he didn't i would
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
need more than what you've just
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
described to get my warrant i would have
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
to see things like blood on the tailgate
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
blood on his clothing nervous actions on
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
his part those all go to the probable
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
cause probably cause requires a number
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
of things it has to be
 
02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
more likely than not that the person
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
committed the crime that's a high
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
standard that's why the warrant is
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
required they want a judge to review
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the colonel
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
i just have one clarifying one i want to
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
make sure i heard you crystal clear
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
three times this reasonable standard
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
this articulable reasonable suspicion
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
standards been
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
been brought before the supreme court
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court and three
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
times has been upheld as constitutional
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct state v beauchemin state
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
v marconi and stavey kimball all three
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh involved searches under these
 
02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the supreme court
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
ruled in our favor and gave very
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
decisive opinions that this did not
 
02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
violate anyone's rights thank you thank
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%

02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%

02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:20.070 align:start position:0%
the written testimony that i've given
you

02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
came back with 12
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
i think 12 names but since that time
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
that i printed it i had additional
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
responses and
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
the opposition is supported by over 25
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
members who reviewed it
 
02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.230 align:start position:0%
members who reviewed it
and

02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to make that statement clear
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
that from the from a majority
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
perspective of the commercial fishermen
 
02:53:46.230 --> 02:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we oppose this bill
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
i could go on but everything has been
 
02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:49.830 align:start position:0%
i could go on but everything has been
said

02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
but i will
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
i will state
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
the commercial fisherman's community
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
respect and value the presence of new
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game officers to
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
enforce marine
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations these officers do
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
it in a manner that is respectful and
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's courteous and it's professional
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
in every sense of the word
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
and do not abuse their rights afforded
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
them to do their jobs
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
if there is value in the adage of it's
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
not broke don't fix it
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
this would be the prime reason to
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
propose house bill 1091
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have the expectation of these
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
officers to perform a variety of their
 
02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
duties beyond their primary primary
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
resource function ranging from dangerous
 
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
and challenging search and rescue
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
operations to assisting other law
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
with rapidly changing environmental
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
conditions they are there daily to
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
protect our natural resources and should
 
02:54:49.830 --> 02:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
be given every tool and opportunity to
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
do so
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
we join
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you sir for coming for
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fish and game committee
 
02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right so that concludes that's all
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
our pink cards
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
i am just going to open it up for
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst the members i'll give
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
my opinion on this first or at least my
 
02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
position i i think the testimony
 
02:55:30.070 --> 02:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
actually one thing i did i haven't been
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
doing with the other bills i just
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
remembered i did ask remote testimony or
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
at least remote positioning is still
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
allowed on the on the general court
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
website so people can sign in and
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
support or oppose a bill and i have uh
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
the re results just understand that this
 
02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
the re results just understand that this
is

02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
tentative results because that is open
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
until the end of the day so people could
 
02:55:52.230 --> 02:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
still submit ones but as of the eight
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
o'clock this morning when this was
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
printed out there are eight people in
 
02:55:56.710 --> 02:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and 24 opposed the
 
02:55:56.720 --> 02:55:58.309 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and 24 opposed the
bill

02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that being said i you know i guess i
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'm smarter especially
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to constitutional matters
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire supreme court on
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
three different occasions so my
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
inclination is to itl this bill
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
at best i i could consider an interim
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
study if we think there's some sort of
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
merit in here anywhere that we want to
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
flesh out um but
 
02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is my general inclination is an
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
ital motion or an interim study motion
 
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i open it up for other members to
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
give their opinion and see where we
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
stand on this
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
02:56:32.230 --> 02:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion for interim
 
02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:34.150 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion for interim
study

02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay well we're in executive session and
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
the motion well actually we're still in
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
the public session i haven't opened up
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
for executive yet so this is just so i
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
can get to the committee and the public
 
02:56:42.479 --> 02:56:51.349 align:start position:0%
can get to the committee and the public
hearing

02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.359 --> 02:56:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
secondation

02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
secondation
 
02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%

seabrook hampton falls and hearing from
 
02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
the fishermen and lobstermens and also
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
colonel george connell jordan's
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh passionate testimony you know i
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
cannot support this uh amendment and
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
because the the current law existing law
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
is working
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
and you know if something working we
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
should not touch it and if it is gonna
 
02:57:29.349 --> 02:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishermen
 
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
is need a lot of help you know they have
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
many regulations many things happening
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
to them we need to help them every
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
possible weekend
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
and this bill is going to harm them i
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
cannot support that and if we think that
 
02:57:45.429 --> 02:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
the interim study is not going to do
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
anything so why to do interim study just
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
itl thank you mr chairman no problems

we've seen this type of bill before i
 
02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
see no value in sending it to in to
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
interim study and i would definitely be
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%

02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
as a 45-year
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
sportsman and uh you know doing a lot of
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
hunting fishing i understand that uh our
 
02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
wildlife and fisheries
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh we we walk a delegate delicate
 
02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
balance line with that and uh
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
as has as has been stated in this
 
02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh before uh new hampshire has
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
the best you know uh fish and game
 
02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
department in the in the country uh by
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
none and uh you know i certainly
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and i think the problem
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
here is uh you know the the fact that
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
the the legislature gave
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
the um fish and game department police
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
powers uh to do other things like up in
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
the north country um
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
and um you know there's never been any
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh never never been anything to uh
 
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
to to really define when a a
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
conservation officer switches hats and
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
puts on puts on a police officer's hat
 
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i don't know if this
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
this bill does that as as as written i
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
i see some flaws in it and um you know i
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
that that's my reasoning for um for it
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
for not itl for uh for interim study uh
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good idea to to clearly
 
03:00:05.279 --> 03:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good idea to to clearly
define

03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
define
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um you know what uh when
 
03:00:11.030 --> 03:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
i when i go hunting and fishing i i have
 
03:00:13.510 --> 03:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
that understanding that uh you know new
 
03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game is there to
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
protect all of it you know
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i've seen plenty of times when
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
people abuse it you know you see the guy
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's walking away from a stream with
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
20 trout
 
03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
and stuff we can't have that but
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
then again we can't have conservation
 
03:00:32.230 --> 03:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
officers being called to a a scene uh
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know a say a state cop that can't
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
get a warm and
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
you know have a call a co
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
into uh to to use the the lesser lesser
 
03:00:43.349 --> 03:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
standards um
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know we can't have that either and
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's that's my reasoning
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
behind an interim study and amending
 
03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:50.830 align:start position:0%
behind an interim study and amending
this

03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
further representative craig
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i have a slightly different
 
03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i have a slightly different
take

03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
i respect the opinions of my colleagues
 
03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
here i greatly respect and have great
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
affection for colonel jordan
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot personally and
 
03:01:06.399 --> 03:01:09.269 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot personally and
privately

03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
the default state
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the human condition
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
is that we are free to go about our
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
lives without interference
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why the fourth amendment
 
03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
and that's why the fourth amendment
guarantees

03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we can do exactly that
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
without being stopped or interfered with
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
the colonel mentioned earlier
 
03:01:36.389 --> 03:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
checking a phishing license and compared
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
it to checking your driver's license
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the moment any government official with
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
the parent authority
 
03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
tells someone that
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are not free to go
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
and that person has been seized under
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
the fourth amendment
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if they stand there
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
quietly or if they sit there in their
 
03:01:54.399 --> 03:01:55.510 align:start position:0%
quietly or if they sit there in their
boat

03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
boat
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
or if they're handcuffed
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
they've been seized
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
anything that results from that
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
while

03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game has general police
 
03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:08.630 align:start position:0%
fishing game has general police
authority

03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
to make traffic stops
 
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
they can't just look at random cars
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
going down the road and decide to pull
 
03:02:16.230 --> 03:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
them over and check for a driver's
 
03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:18.469 align:start position:0%
them over and check for a driver's
license

03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
but they can do that with fishing and
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
hunting licenses
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
even in cases where it's not clear that
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
the person is
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
hunting or fishing if they have the
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate equipment
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
they can
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
perform checks such as that
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
they can do that with boaters for safety
 
03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:41.590 align:start position:0%
they can do that with boaters for safety
checks

03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't support interim study i think
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
we should take it straight up or down
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
i would support the bill
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
as amended or not
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's not because i want to make things
 
03:02:55.670 --> 03:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for our good officers out
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
but it's because
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be inconvenient by
 
03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:01.990 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be inconvenient by
design

03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
design
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
under the united states and new
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitutions it should be
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
very inconvenient
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
for government authorities
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
to stop someone
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
to inquire of them to search them
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
it should require an extraordinary
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
measure to interfere with anyone going
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
about their lives
 
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
their work or their recreation
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
i supported this bill when i first heard
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
it being mentioned
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
and whether as amended or as originally
 
03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:33.030 align:start position:0%
and whether as amended or as originally
written

03:03:33.030 --> 03:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
i would support otp
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative craig
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative craig uh expressed my
 
03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
position more eloquently than i would
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
have and i also agree with the comment
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative love made
 
03:03:50.550 --> 03:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
that uh you know
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
things the issues got complicated once
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
i guess 10 years ago they were given
 
03:03:56.950 --> 03:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
more general
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
police powers
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
and so i would support
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent horgan um
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes i spent
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
a few years living in the north country
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
i mean not just not as far north as say
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
represent craig lives in orford new
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
back then in the 1990s and i think it's
 
03:04:21.750 --> 03:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
still the case now there are very very
 
03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
still the case now there are very very
few

03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
few
 
03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
police officers there most of the
 
03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
towns either relied strictly on the
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
state police barracks or they might
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
supplement that with a few uh
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
part-time constables many of whom
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
well they probably upgraded the police
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
training since then but many who were
 
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
poorly were poorly trained and um you
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
know didn't
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
often didn't observe any of the niceties
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion versus probable
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
cause i think
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's one reason that i think they we
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
we should that enhancing the powers of
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
the fish and game uh
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
conservation officers was a good idea
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
because that supplements the very few uh
 
03:05:01.110 --> 03:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
police officers are up there it's not
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
like where i live now in durham where we
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
have more police officers per capita
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
than in new york city and we're
 
03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
than in new york city and we're
um

03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
and this also the oppositions of bill
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
were mostly people who are not direct
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
well i mean some of them probably are
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
hunters and fishers but it's mostly
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
about the general issue of
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
guns in the second amendment and i
 
03:05:23.429 --> 03:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
don't see a
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
i personally don't see a second
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendment violation in what the fish and
 
03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
game officers are doing and
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate that
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
thanks so i think the itl even though it
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
won't be unanimous it's probably the
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
right way to go and uh representative
 
03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
right way to go and uh representative
kittrich

03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
kittrich
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
this has been very illuminating sitting
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
here listening to these various opinions
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
what we haven't really discussed is
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine's amendment
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm in favor of interim study
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
but i would like to say in addition
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
we are giving the fish and game officers
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
a very difficult job
 
03:06:05.670 --> 03:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i am very loath to put handcuffs on
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
them while they try to do it
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time i agree with my
 
03:06:11.510 --> 03:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues sitting here
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
that our freedoms and our liberties are
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
very important but liberty is freedom
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
with personal responsibility
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's why we have policemen
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
because some people forget the part
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
about personal responsibility when they
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
talk about freedom
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i would like to i would i would favor
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.070 --> 03:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'll learn more when that
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
happens i really want to talk to some
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
experienced police officers
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
i have a little story i lived in
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
lived on the economy in england for
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
three for two out of three years of the
 
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
air force over in england
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
i had a girlfriend on the other side of
 
03:06:52.399 --> 03:06:53.590 align:start position:0%
i had a girlfriend on the other side of
london

03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
london
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
coming back at two o'clock in the
 
03:06:55.359 --> 03:06:56.469 align:start position:0%
coming back at two o'clock in the
morning

03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:06:58.710 --> 03:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
i was driving my little austin van which
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
is like a miniature suv
 
03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
is like a miniature suv
black

03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
black
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
but it was basically a tradesman's
 
03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:06.550 align:start position:0%
but it was basically a tradesman's
vehicle

03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:07:10.230 --> 03:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
and two and a zip car pulled me over
 
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
and they very politely asked me out
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
and one asked me what i was doing at two
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
in knightsbridge
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
because i didn't belong there
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know they they were paying attention
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
they knew who had vehicles in their in
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
there you know and they were a little
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
worried that i might just be a burglar
 
03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're totally polite i was not
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
offended by it
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
they were making that neighborhood safer
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are people out here that are
 
03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
there are people out here that are
seeking

03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
03:07:41.359 --> 03:07:42.710 align:start position:0%
seeking
outrage

03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
outrage
 
03:07:45.990 --> 03:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
at people trying to do reasonable things
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult path between our
 
03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
duty to our our wildlife as fellow
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
citizens our liberties
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
and the practicalities of
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
necessary police work
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i favor interim study thank you very
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%

03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead thank you mr
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:08:12.479 --> 03:08:13.510 align:start position:0%
chair um
i

03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
first of all and i think colonel jordan
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
is aware of this i have just the most
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
respect for him and his law enforcement
 
03:08:20.399 --> 03:08:21.429 align:start position:0%
respect for him and his law enforcement
officers

03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
officers
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
most of the interactions i've ever had
 
03:08:23.439 --> 03:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
most of the interactions i've ever had
with

03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers at all have
 
03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
been positive
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
but in every field there are bad actors
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
and while i have respect and i
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely don't suspect that there have
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
been any problems
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
at all i did take an oath
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the constitution and i have to take
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
the fourth amendment seriously i what i
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
would suggest is that we don't
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
i do not want to see this
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
for an up or down vote today
 
03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
for an up or down vote today
perhaps

03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
either execute later or interim study
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
today because i think that it's
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
incumbent on me knowing that the fourth
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is a serious issue i'm not
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
sure i'm going to admit my own ignorance
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
that i don't know if the law actually
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts but i would like to study it a
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
little bit further myself so that i'm
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
clear if there's any kind of amendment
 
03:09:14.230 --> 03:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
that could just add even just a single
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying sentence
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
to just make this issue put it to bed
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
then that's what i would like to see but
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
i would just like to understand the
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
i listened to the testimony offered and
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
learned that the supreme court has
 
03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
learned that the supreme court has
upheld

03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
upheld
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
and have heard that it would impact
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that is wanted by
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
folks who came out of their way to give
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
their testimony
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
i see it as a bill that we should i or i
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
see what we're looking at is something
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
we should itl
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
i can't see how it can be
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
fixed and made
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know better
 
03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
and more reasonable if if our supreme
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
court says it's okay three times
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
i believe it's okay
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative ellis
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
um i agree with uh
 
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative carrich on the
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of your freedoms
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
and so i think the law enforcement
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
officers and the fish and game officers
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
all trained the same
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't need this
 
03:10:40.710 --> 03:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
this bill i think should be itil
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna make one clarifying comment
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
and then we'll just get a sense is that
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
to me one of the most things that i
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
heard out of this out of this testimony
 
03:10:52.469 --> 03:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
today was
 
03:10:54.389 --> 03:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
about the regulated community we heard
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the lobstermen we heard from the
 
03:10:57.510 --> 03:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
fishermen we heard from the hunters who
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
all said leave it alone
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
um the people who were being regulated
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
and being
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the stats to the statute um
 
03:11:08.230 --> 03:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
all came out and said it's working don't
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
mess it up
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
we follow that up with the fact that we
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
had three supreme court cases all of
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
which have upheld the standard of
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion and lastly we have
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
a u.s supreme court case under terry
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
right that holds the reasonable
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
suspicion standard and i want to be
 
03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
clear it's articulable reasonable
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
suspicion it's not just a hunch it's a
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
hunch that you can actually put words
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
around to define so it's not a random
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
just pull a car over
 
03:11:35.590 --> 03:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
but it's uh i have a reason and this is
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
my reason i can not only do i know it i
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
can articulate it to the court right in
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
my police report so i i think the
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
standards have all been established
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
around this and and i think the probably
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
one place where i'd recommend interim
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
study is we've granted this 594 powers
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
over here which is the full-blown police
 
03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
over here which is the full-blown police
powers

03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
powers
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
but then we also have the 206 powers
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
over here which is slightly different
 
03:12:02.309 --> 03:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
um from from the full-blown powers and
 
03:12:02.319 --> 03:12:03.429 align:start position:0%
um from from the full-blown powers and
so

03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
i think if anything an interim study
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
would allow somebody to give us give us
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
time to look at those two differential
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
statutes that govern powers of a
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
conservation officer and then we've
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
overlapped with powers of a police
 
03:12:18.230 --> 03:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
officer and give us time to review that
 
03:12:20.230 --> 03:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
and have the rest of the year to look at
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
that and recommend possible if there is
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
something that could clarify those two
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
powers laws then let's do that but i
 
03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill does it because it
 
03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
only talks about 206. it doesn't talk
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
about 594 at all and so that would be my
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
reasoning for supporting an interim
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
study is to allow that definition to see
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
if there is conflict between there to do
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
an interim study of that and have the
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee meet to discuss the different
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
differentials between those two powers
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
if they exist and if they do how can we
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
further clarify it
 
03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
further clarify it
so

03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we were able to put this to interim
 
03:12:57.429 --> 03:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
study to address the concerns that you
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
outlined i would
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly invite colonel jordan to
 
03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
join in to try to address the situations
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
that he has
 
03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out himself make his training
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
hard and make him want to throttle
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
whoever wrote it originally
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
because i believe that consensus could
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
become two that would make his job
 
03:13:21.990 --> 03:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
and with that we're going to close the
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill 1091 i'm
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
going to open it up into exec exec

03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
interesting study motion

and i'll second that myself
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%

administration
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
the person that does apply would be
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
required to pay the entire license fee
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the year of application but from
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
that point forward the license is for
 
03:17:32.080 --> 03:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
that point forward the license is for
life

03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
i also added into the bill that if a
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
physician who falsely certifies a
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
disability for the purpose of dissection
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a violation subject
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
to a 500 fine
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to read the testimony
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
here it's a quick email short from the
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
person that asked me to submit this bill
 
03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:50.150 align:start position:0%
person that asked me to submit this bill
um

03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
i have been disabled since 1989. i have
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
had multiple surgeries on my neck fused
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
from c2 to c7 multiple surgeries on my
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
back in the lumber area unable to work
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
at any capacity i always purchased a
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
catch and release license for many years
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
as fishing was something i could do to
 
03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
relax that is no longer possible i am 66
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
years old now and to purchase a fishing
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
license at full price to go fishing
 
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
eight to ten times a year at best only
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
to catch and release is truly unfair the
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
disabled person and retired person
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
already has a decreased income the
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
outdoor activities that each of us can
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
do are limited some of us have limited
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
mobility the state of new hampshire has
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
made our love of fishing impossible to
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
afford i only hope that the state of new
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire will consider either lowering
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
the age for a free license or bring back
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
to catch a release license now i
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
understand that signed by william dixon

14 stone view road ossipee new hampshire
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
zero three eight six four
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
i understand with every bill there's a
 
03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
cause and effect the effect is this is
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
gonna lower income to the fish and game
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
department which is which is a hardship
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
mean being that they run on a tight
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
budget every year
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i do understand at some point there
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment coming forward to
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
offset that revenue by another means but
 
03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
at this time that is point is still up
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%

03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on this i'm not
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is the first time i've ever reached
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
this table and not been comfortable to
 
03:20:17.359 --> 03:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
this table and not been comfortable to
testify

03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
because i have some strong beliefs that
 
03:20:22.630 --> 03:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
veterans deserve everything and more
 
03:20:24.309 --> 03:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
than what we we are currently giving
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
them the problem is
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
we voted we being the commission voted
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill and they did it
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
strictly because of the fiscal impacts
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're a self-funded agency
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
and as i said earlier in the hike safe
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill we struggle to fund everything
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
we currently offer these licenses to
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that are service connected
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
100 disability we follow i actually did
 
03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
a little research on this when they
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
asked me to speak on it
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
we follow department of safety motor
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles and department of safety who
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
offer registrations and licenses under
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
the same guidelines for we offer it free
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
both agencies do for people that have
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
service connected disabilities so if
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's not service connected we don't do
 
03:21:07.269 --> 03:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
it if it's 80 percent
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
we give them a reduced cost
 
03:21:11.190 --> 03:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i looked at what we're trying to do
 
03:21:13.510 --> 03:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
here the two two concerns i had here one
 
03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
is it lists a physical disa list the
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
disability is just being a disability
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i would just encourage legislate all
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
of you to remember that that disability
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
could be emotional so we could have
 
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
someone with a primary back problem but
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
he's but diagnosed as a bipolar uh which
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
got him up to the 100 percent so that's
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
concerning to me
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the past it was always physical
 
03:21:35.910 --> 03:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities the language in this just
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
says disability so we could have
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
emotional or physical the other concern
 
03:21:43.190 --> 03:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
i have is we're asking
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's a charitable thing i think it's i
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
think i have a long history in my family
 
03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
think i have a long history in my family
of

03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
service to the military and serviced as
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
you could guest service the tire family
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
has done that so i have some
 
03:21:55.920 --> 03:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
has done that so i have some
very

03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
very strong opinions about veterans
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh and what they deserve
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um i think it's a little unfair to ask
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
the sportsmen and women to fund it i
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
think it should be funded by all
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
citizens if we're going to give out a
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
benefit like this because all citizens
 
03:22:14.229 --> 03:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
have benefited from their service
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
so with that thought process in mind i'm
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
going to go out on the limb here and
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
suggest that we do it with a number
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
plate and a license
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason i say that is it's always
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
bothered me that a veteran comes home as
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
my son did after four tours on iraq
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
wishing to get a veterans plate no
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
interest in hunting which is sad hunted
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
all the time with me i've never been
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
able to this day 20 years later been
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to get him to go back out which is
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
kind of sad so i i think there are a lot
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
of veterans out there that wouldn't take
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of this that in fact deserve
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
something like this so i thought of the
 
03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
number plates and the licenses because
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
no matter the physical disability all
 
03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
veterans have got to have a vehicle i'm
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
quite convinced most of them have
 
03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:57.269 align:start position:0%
quite convinced most of them have
licenses

03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the department of safety at the risk
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be very angry at
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
me for suggesting this as a general
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
funded agency so be quite simple for
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
them to go back to the general fund the
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
next budget and ask for the increased
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
money to make up for this i think that
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
offers the opportunity for all taxpayers
 
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
to contribute to it instead of just the
 
03:23:17.190 --> 03:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
sportsmen and women the other factor in
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
our our physical impacts that uh we have
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
had chairman language reached out to us
 
03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
to try in
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
many ways to find out what that impact
 
03:23:27.510 --> 03:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be fiscal impacts i talked to pam
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
ellis and
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
beat the folks over at
 
03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal here
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a reasonable
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
impact that that would have on us
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
fiscally and the problem is we don't
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
know what that would be because we have
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
a law that that allows maine and vermont
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
residents reciprocity so
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
opening this standard up would also open
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
up the opportunity for maine and vermont
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
to come in here and get this same
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
benefit on a new hampshire license
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
the monies that we lose on new hampshire
 
03:23:54.319 --> 03:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
the monies that we lose on new hampshire
licenses

03:23:55.750 --> 03:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:23:57.190 --> 03:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
not only include the price of the
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
license but it includes includes a
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
habitat fee for fishing and a habitat
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
fee for wildlife management
 
03:24:07.110 --> 03:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we use to purchase the fast ever
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
fast vanishing public lands that would
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
be lost
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
we use the money for federal match when
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
we get federal money to manage our
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
wildlife and our resources that would
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
take a hit if we're giving these
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
licenses out free
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and and our pr money pittman roberts
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
money which as you know is very valuable
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
to to wildlife management and our dingle
 
03:24:30.309 --> 03:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
johnson money which is very valuable to
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
our fisheries management all are
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
distributed to each state based on the
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
number of paid licenses we would lose
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
or could lose some of that so for all of
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
those concerns
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
we are here in opposition of it but i i
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
got to tell you that's the only reason i
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
oppose it i think it i think veterans
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
deserve much more than they get to me it
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
just made sense to give them their
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
plates and their licenses because i
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
think they would all benefit from that
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i think all citizens would be able
 
03:24:59.429 --> 03:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
to say they've now contributed to that
 
03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative spelling
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair question
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question colonel jordan um
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
i just to clarify
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
because you're talking a lot about
 
03:25:13.190 --> 03:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
veterans you understand that the way
 
03:25:15.190 --> 03:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is written it's actually
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
affecting anyone with a disability and i
 
03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
think i would ask if do you remember
 
03:25:23.110 --> 03:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of years i ushered through with
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.479 --> 03:25:27.429 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
in fact the whole department helped
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
gave the veterans themselves the 80
 
03:25:35.429 --> 03:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
percent to 99
 
03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
half-price lifetime license
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
because we only had the 100
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
total disability and that also exempted
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh reciprocity from maine and vermont in
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
order to make that happen
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
and be fiscally viable
 
03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
and be fiscally viable
um

03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:52.630 --> 03:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
those things aren't in here but this
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
also addresses a larger population of
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
anyone who's disabled not just veterans
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
right this would open it up for a number
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
of people the other question i had
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
it strikes the language for paraplegics
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
and those folks with permanent loss of
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
the lower use of their extremities now
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming those people would go and
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
get that 100 percent disability
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important to understand
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
it would strike that benefit for them
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
currently the way it's written so that's
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
another concern i had with that and
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're right it would open the door for
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
many many more
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
to make many more people eligible for it
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
my follow-up uh would be
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
when we did the other bill for the
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
military veterans that were disabled
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
from 80 to 99
 
03:26:37.349 --> 03:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was based on the 50 of their lifetime
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
license cost based on your actuary
 
03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:40.870 align:start position:0%
license cost based on your actuary
tables

03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
tables
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
this written as it is just has them pay
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
the regular fee for a yearly license
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
once and then it expands
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
do you know what the difference is in
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
cost because i know lifetime licenses
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
are a lot more but as you get older they
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
become less and less expensive so in
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
some instances this could be more
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
lifetime license if it was written that
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
way in some instances it would be a lot
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh less
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree with you but like my
 
03:27:08.469 --> 03:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
lifetime license would probably be 10
 
03:27:08.479 --> 03:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
lifetime license would probably be 10
bucks

03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
a 20 year old uh who they expect to live
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
much longer would be a lot more money so
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
it would that is and that was all of the
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
issues that we struggled with trying to
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
come up with a fiscal impact i don't
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
know that i can accurately predict it
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
and then my other concern i'll be very
 
03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
frank my other concern is there are
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
numerous times that we are promised
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
infusions if you will or short money to
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
go in at budget creation and then
 
03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
through the budget process that gets
 
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
pulled out so
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about the fiscal
 
03:27:39.990 --> 03:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
impact we're at this agency's at a point
 
03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
where we're struggling to make ends meet
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly uh we're a self-funded
 
03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
agency and i just i don't think this is
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
the place to be giving stuff away i just
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can do that i think
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's risky i'd i would much rather see
 
03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
these people benefit from a license
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
plate or a driver's license that
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
everybody can contribute to
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh and everybody in those situations
 
03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh and everybody in those situations
uses

03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
uses
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think 100 there are a lot of 100
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
percent disabled people that would hunt
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
all good points thank you jordan further
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you colonel jordan um
 
03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
thank you colonel jordan um
so

03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
obviously i understand that if you give
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
a discount on a license and you have
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
already several discounts for veterans
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
and disabled people
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
um including some free licenses
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh that that is a loss of revenue for
 
03:28:36.630 --> 03:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
those people who would have otherwise
 
03:28:36.640 --> 03:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
those people who would have otherwise
bought

03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
bought
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
said license not obviously it's not a
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue if some of those people
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
could not have afforded those licenses
 
03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
without the discount right so you're not
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
taking a hit on that so i guess my
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i've offered this before before this
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee in terms passed if we were to
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
change the current structure which is
 
03:28:59.190 --> 03:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
kind of sort of a hodgepodge of
 
03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
kind of sort of a hodgepodge of
different

03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
discounts and license
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
given to veterans and disabled people
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
based on different criteria
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
got rid of that covered those disabled
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
people and veterans who were under a
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
certain income by income only so now
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
you're opening the doors to everyone who
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
currently is not
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
coming in sufficient game and giving you
 
03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:20.710 align:start position:0%
coming in sufficient game and giving you
revenue

03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
but those disabled people and veterans
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
who can't afford to buy a license would
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
then buy a license
 
03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand that that would not
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
impact your revenue and i guess i'm
 
03:29:31.190 --> 03:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
asking you if you would understand it
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
well i don't know that i that i could
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
say it wouldn't it would would certainly
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact of the revenue i think
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh it would we
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think we'd be in the same boat uh kind
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
of guessing it what that would do but
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
you're right that would be a
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
better way i think than opening it up to
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
what this would do
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
i just think if we if we're going to
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
give money away
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
we and the and the and taxpayers feel
 
03:29:58.229 --> 03:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
that this is viable then we all ought to
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to it not just the hunters or
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
the fishermen i think everybody should
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
contribute to it to be fair and the way
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
to do that so with that thought process
 
03:30:06.229 --> 03:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
i did a little research the only way i
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
could see to do that was through and
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to hate me for it but
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
through department of safety with number
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
plates or driver's licenses that's
 
03:30:15.429 --> 03:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
something all of these folks can use
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and if you just take the money you
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
save from registering your vehicle and
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
buying a driver's license you could
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
probably purchase a hunting license
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
now you know where you may not have been
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
able to before but just something else
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative oregon for a question and
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
a potential follow-up well thank you
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair thank you very much
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
colonel hum
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:36.550 align:start position:0%
um the
person

03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to make law based on
 
03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
an anecdote about the
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
gentleman from ossipee i don't know if
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
you've reviewed the letter but he's 66
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
years old and
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
he feels he can no longer purchase a
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
phishing license what would the price be
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:30:51.200 --> 03:30:52.309 align:start position:0%
for a
senior

03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
senior
 
03:30:52.319 --> 03:30:53.269 align:start position:0%
senior
a

03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:30:54.630 --> 03:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
senior citizen who wants to get a
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
fishing license
 
03:30:59.590 --> 03:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh a senior citizen can now buy
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think can buy that at ten dollars
 
03:31:03.510 --> 03:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
gentlemen right
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
seven dollars
 
03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:06.389 align:start position:0%
seven dollars
right

03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah seven dollars as a senior citizen
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
i would buy his license if he couldn't
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
afford a seven dollar license i would
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
pay for that to get him to let the guy
 
03:31:15.760 --> 03:31:17.429 align:start position:0%
pay for that to get him to let the guy
fish

03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
fish
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome sir
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
03:31:24.389 --> 03:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to give it
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
chairman's perspective i guess so
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
i i you can say there colonel in case
 
03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
you have a comment uh from what i say
 
03:31:30.399 --> 03:31:30.770 align:start position:0%
you have a comment uh from what i say
um

03:31:30.770 --> 03:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:30.780 --> 03:31:32.070 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
i share the department's concern about
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
if the legislature keeps chipping away
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
at their revenue sources um it's going
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
to become harder and harder for their
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the department to stay stay afloat
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
without starting to cut services
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
um which which cause causes me concern i
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
originally when i looked at this bill
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i am a co-sponsor of the bill was i
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
talked to colonel jordan and director
 
03:31:56.229 --> 03:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
mason about maybe we put some general
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
fund monies behind this to make the
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
department whole right for the year so
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
if you issue a license at a discount on
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
the mount they can draw from this fund
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
to make it the full amount and they
 
03:32:04.399 --> 03:32:05.269 align:start position:0%
to make it the full amount and they
could

03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
they would be a hunter as a hunter it
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the what the fee
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
goes but i i think from listen to
 
03:32:12.070 --> 03:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that becomes problematic as
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
well um because you're
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're at the mercy of future
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislators legislatures to continue
 
03:32:20.790 --> 03:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
that program and continue that to go on
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:32:25.349 --> 03:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
my inclination on this bill is itl even
 
03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
though i hate to do that but that's my
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
inclination and i'm trying to get a
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
sense of the committee if they're also
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
along with that idea
 
03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
represent sherlock
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know my hack goes out to the
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
individual philosophy is there any
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
chance to hold
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh this bill in advance until our next
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
session and may possibly in the interim
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh work with the colonel and come up
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to this bill so that
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
something could be done
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to do that i'm
 
03:32:57.510 --> 03:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
happy again i'm happy to do that i'm
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get a consensus where we are i
 
03:33:01.349 --> 03:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think our i was trying to do that
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
before this meeting to get a funding
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
source for them to be able to put money
 
03:33:06.309 --> 03:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
into a fund so again we can make them
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
whole so they don't start losing money
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
by issuing because we actually don't
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
know what the impact of this is going to
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
be so it could be one license or it
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
could be a thousand licenses we have no
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
clue just a follow-up it may be that we
 
03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
do end up itl in this bill at our next
 
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
session but if there's some chance in
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
that interim period that something could
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
be worked out i'd rather keep that race
 
03:33:26.479 --> 03:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
be worked out i'd rather keep that race
sunshine

03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
sunshine
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
is that the will of the committee
 
03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay great so we will hold off executive
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
session on this and we will consider it
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
on the 25th and see any member that
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
thinks they have an idea feel free to
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
reach out to the department and see if
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
they can work out a solution and get
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
some language
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
i just asked to try to get any
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendments to the committee before the
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
25th so we have time to review them and
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%

scuba diving
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know third third time i think
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
i've been here we passed it three times
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the house as i recall
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
has played games with it a couple of
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
times and
 
04:07:53.040 --> 04:07:54.150 align:start position:0%
times and
the

04:07:54.150 --> 04:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
one time it died on a table when we were
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
having other issues
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
but typically it does pretty well in the
 
04:08:00.399 --> 04:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
but typically it does pretty well in the
house

04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i've given you three pieces of
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
information one is my testimony that you
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
can read at your
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
leisure um
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
but i've also given you the executive
 
04:08:12.239 --> 04:08:13.429 align:start position:0%
but i've also given you the executive
summary

04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%

04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
from the atlantic states marine
 
04:08:17.590 --> 04:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
fisheries commission
 
04:08:20.150 --> 04:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
which new hampshire sends
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
a representative from the fish and game
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
department as well
 
04:08:28.110 --> 04:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
this is the executive summary of a
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
560 page report which i didn't print out
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:08:33.120 --> 04:08:34.469 align:start position:0%
for us
um

04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
but it uh i did highlight a couple of
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
areas in here that i think
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
04:08:41.520 --> 04:08:43.189 align:start position:0%
speak to
uh

04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:43.199 --> 04:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh
very

04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee room in the past
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
dealing uh with
 
04:08:50.880 --> 04:08:52.229 align:start position:0%
dealing uh with
um

04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
availability of lobsters in our
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
gulf of maine
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the utilization of our
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
lobsters in the gulf of maine
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
basically is telling you
 
04:09:08.239 --> 04:09:09.189 align:start position:0%
basically is telling you
that

04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
current abundance in the gulf of maine
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
stock is at record high abundance
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
estimates show an increasing trend
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
starting in 1988 and accelerating
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
from their words not mine that
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
the stock is not depleted and
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
overfishing is not occurring
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue that's come up in
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
in this committee in the past
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's actually even a graph to show
 
04:09:39.040 --> 04:09:40.309 align:start position:0%
there's actually even a graph to show
you

04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
the rate of increase on the last page of
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
that marine
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
fisheries commission
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
i've also given you
 
04:09:54.000 --> 04:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
i've also given you
some

04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
information specific to new hampshire
 
04:09:58.720 --> 04:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
information specific to new hampshire
that

04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
is one of four pages here
 
04:10:02.560 --> 04:10:03.830 align:start position:0%
is one of four pages here
and

04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i've highlighted the areas that i
 
04:10:08.150 --> 04:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
want you to concentrate on
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
one is saying that our recreational
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
catch in new hampshire
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
currently is about half of one percent
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
of all new hampshire inshore lobster
 
04:10:17.840 --> 04:10:19.670 align:start position:0%
of all new hampshire inshore lobster
landings

04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
landings
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently allows
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
five traps
 
04:10:23.680 --> 04:10:24.389 align:start position:0%
five traps
by

04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
non-resid i'm sorry by resident
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
um non-commercial people
 
04:10:34.150 --> 04:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
and and that has been claimed in in past
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
hearings to be sufficient to allow
 
04:10:40.150 --> 04:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
equal access to uh
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
to all residents of new hampshire
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we've made the case that uh it's not
 
04:10:48.630 --> 04:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
really equal access because uh in order
 
04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:49.429 align:start position:0%
really equal access because uh in order
to

04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
to satisfy those five traps you need to
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
have a boat you can't just throw them
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
off your
 
04:10:56.160 --> 04:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
off your
wharf

04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
wharf
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
you need to have a boat that's
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
accessible to the coast
 
04:11:06.150 --> 04:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
so you can access it on to to service
 
04:11:06.160 --> 04:11:09.670 align:start position:0%
so you can access it on to to service
the

04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
fishing gear
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
and you need to have the time available
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
from either a uh
 
04:11:16.319 --> 04:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
from either a uh
very

04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful spouse or boss that lets you
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
every couple of days
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
service your fishing gear
 
04:11:24.720 --> 04:11:26.229 align:start position:0%
service your fishing gear
so

04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
if you contrast that with our current
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation where a diver perhaps could
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
come down out of claremont or
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
lebanon or somewhere and and go when it
 
04:11:37.840 --> 04:11:38.950 align:start position:0%
lebanon or somewhere and and go when it
fits

04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
fits
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
their schedule
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
it would certainly allow
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
many more people in new hampshire to
 
04:11:45.199 --> 04:11:46.309 align:start position:0%
many more people in new hampshire to
access

04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
this natural resource
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um also in the past
 
04:11:51.600 --> 04:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
um also in the past
one

04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
so the issues we've we've written
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
come into in the in past hearings were
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the stock
 
04:11:59.520 --> 04:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
the stock
overfishing

04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
overfishing
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
recreational impact
 
04:12:03.439 --> 04:12:04.469 align:start position:0%
recreational impact
and

04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
all of the reports are saying here that
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
recreational impact up and down the east
 
04:12:09.120 --> 04:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
recreational impact up and down the east
coast

04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
coast
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
is negligible and therefore ignored
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and maine are the only two
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
states that don't allow scuba divers or
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
free divers to access the natural
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
resource of lobsters
 
04:12:23.760 --> 04:12:25.429 align:start position:0%
resource of lobsters
um

04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:27.750 --> 04:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
but the two issues that uh that come
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
about in the senate are safety and
 
04:12:30.800 --> 04:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
about in the senate are safety and
enforcement

04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to concentrate for just a
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
minute on those two
 
04:12:36.080 --> 04:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
minute on those two
um

04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
i've asked for
 
04:12:42.150 --> 04:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
since we first submitted this bill back
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
and or i first submitted it i think 2011
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
for any documentation from any of the
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
coastal states on the east coast of the
 
04:12:52.560 --> 04:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
coastal states on the east coast of the
us

04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:12:53.760 --> 04:12:54.710 align:start position:0%
us
where

04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
divers and
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
commercial lobstermen have uh have
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
interacted and
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's that documentation has yet to
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh be
 
04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh be
provided

04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
we've done extensive research and have
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
not found any cases of
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
of it being a safety issue
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to be concerned about
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
divers are currently in that those areas
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
where commercial
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
lobstermen are currently working
 
04:13:29.349 --> 04:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
now that happens
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
i bet it's happening right now as we
 
04:13:31.359 --> 04:13:32.870 align:start position:0%
i bet it's happening right now as we
speak

04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
so and we've not heard of any any
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
problems with any of that
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
as far as enforcement goes um i would
 
04:13:42.950 --> 04:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
point out that this bill is a five-year
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's covering only the two months of
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
september and october
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can assess whether safety is
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
an issue or incidents have occurred
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
it allows five lobsters per day limit
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the only effective change for the
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
conservation officer's duties
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
to restrict
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
the taking of five lobsters where now
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
um enforce with existing staff
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
a zero tolerance um this would simply be
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
counting to five um and allowing
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
five lobsters to be taken
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
um the size the sex the everything
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
is already being enforced on all
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
non-commercial and commercial
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
bases so this would simply be
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
making sure what they're enforcing is
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
zero would now be five
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
and the and the lobster
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the divers would be identified by
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
the number on their
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
dive flag so
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think uh with that i'll end my
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm happy to answer any
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
questions i'm sure there's more than a
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
few pink cards that
 
04:15:00.790 --> 04:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
have to be called
 
04:15:00.800 --> 04:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
have to be called
but

04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%

to clarify

that the fish and game commission has

also voted to oppose house bill 1297

is the state's most valuable commercial

34 million dollars annually in revenue
 
04:16:42.870 --> 04:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the more than

330 licensed commercial harvesters
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
if you add in the recreational
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
harvesters you're adding in another
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
couple hundred
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
certain economic models suggest the
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
overall contribution to new hampshire's
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
economy is likely three to four times
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
that amount
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that would equate to roughly
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
102 to 130 as such this is a highly

commissioned 2020 lobster stock
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
assessment has raised concerns over the
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
lack of young of the year recruitment in
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
since in fact 19 2012 it has started to
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
go down and this is not just within new
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire waters where we sample but
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
also in the gulf of maine where the
 
04:17:57.760 --> 04:17:59.030 align:start position:0%
also in the gulf of maine where the
other

04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
so this could translate to having lower

numbers of harvestable lobsters in our
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%

solve the problem of providing access to

yes they can throw them off their dock

04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
presents an immense challenge for law
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement even now
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
there are reported conflicts between

lobsters from these individuals traps
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
and this requires a considerable amount

of covert law enforcement

enforcement observation is limited due
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
to issues such as but not limited to
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
visibility from the surface if they're
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%

04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
the current law prohibiting the
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
possession of lobsters by a diver has
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
been a sufficient deterrent to tampering
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
with traps in most instances
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
the deterrent effective of the current
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
law would no longer be enforced
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
during an open season for taking

04:20:37.040 --> 04:20:38.309 align:start position:0%
lobsters by diving
and

04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
the ease in which lobsters of legal size
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
can be found in lobster traps is
 
04:20:43.279 --> 04:20:44.790 align:start position:0%
can be found in lobster traps is
enticing

04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
enticing
 
04:20:44.800 --> 04:20:46.389 align:start position:0%
enticing
um

04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:49.110 --> 04:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and it would help them select for
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
legal-sized lobsters
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
at a faster level
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
if this legislation is signed into law
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the best evidence for a successful
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
prosecution would be to observe the
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
divers actually taking lobsters from the
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
traps which would require
 
04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
conservation officers to be diving
 
04:21:13.110 --> 04:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
in the immediate area and observing this
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
sort of illegal activity
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
in effect this would make prosecution of
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
a diver taking a lobster from a
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
harvester's trap nearly impossible
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
secondly we are concerned about the
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
effect this method of capture may
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
have on the lobsters themselves
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
while trap fishing is a passive form of
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
capture scuba diving is an active form
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
that involves grabbing and oftentimes
 
04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
chasing a fleeing
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
lobster to catch it
 
04:21:47.110 --> 04:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
a lobster will shed one or both of its
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
claws during this active form of capture
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to escape
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
scuba divers will encounter and handle
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
legally undersized lobsters for each
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
legal size lobster they incur encounter
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
and lobsters will eventually hate the
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
lost claws
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.640 --> 04:22:14.469 align:start position:0%
 
effect

04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
is a short-term loss
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
of any sort of
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
harvestability for these lobsters that
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
are caught within the traps
 
04:22:24.399 --> 04:22:25.349 align:start position:0%
are caught within the traps
so

04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
commercial harvesters will have what's
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
called cults in their in their traps
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
which are of
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
lower value economic value
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
in addition newly molted soft cell
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
lobsters hide under rocks for several
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
weeks until their shells have hardened
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're vulnerable to this kind of
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
handling a newly molted lobster body is
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
literally like jello
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and when handled could uh sustain severe
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
or life-threatening damage to its uh to
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
its internal organs many factors control
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
when the lobster with will molt so it's
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
hard to determine
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
timing or season
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
for when
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
lobsters will be molting however
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
during our sampling we have found
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
molting lobsters to occur between june
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
next we're concerned about the negative
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
effect that this habit this method of
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
harvest would have on the nearshore
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
habitat lobsters spend most of their
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
time burrowed
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.670 --> 04:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
mud holes wherever they can hide
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
after the surface floating life stages
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
the post larval will settle to the
 
04:23:51.840 --> 04:23:53.349 align:start position:0%
the post larval will settle to the
bottom

04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
in september and in october that's when
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're settling
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
and trying to find their their niche
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to find their habitat
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
disruption to this habitat will affect
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
their survivability
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
the university of maine's lobster
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
institute has determined that for every
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
50 000 eggs only about two lobsters are
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
expected to survive to legal size they
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
need their habitat they need to be able
 
04:24:22.560 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
need their habitat they need to be able
to

04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
moving rocks to try to get to the
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
lobsters and such
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
affecting their habitat in general
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
these habitats are not
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
just for lobsters but numerous species
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
of marine invertebrates and plants that
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
form the foundation to the marine
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
ecosystem to capture lobsters divers
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
would need to turn over many rocks on
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
every diving
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
trip damaging or killing marine life
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
that is attached to the top of them and
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
are rummaging through areas of eel grass
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
beds disrupting their
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
their root system the cumulative effect
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
of a couple hundred licensed divers
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
making even just one lobster dive per
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
year along our short
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
coastline is could be significant
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier the lobster trap
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
is a passive capture device and several
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
rules have been implemented regarding
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
trap construction to
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
minimize their impact um on the lobster
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
resource in their habitat for example
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
all traps have what we call runners they
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
they lift the trap up off the bottom of
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
the ocean
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
so that there's not as much
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.319 --> 04:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
in addition that the traps are required
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
to have escape vents to
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
permit escapement of the juveniles or
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
undersized lobsters as well as they need
 
04:26:10.080 --> 04:26:11.670 align:start position:0%
undersized lobsters as well as they need
biodegradable

04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
biodegradable
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
escape panels to allow
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
the adult lobsters to get out of these
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
traps if
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
after a period of time the traps aren't
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
raised or they're lost in storms there's
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
ways for them to be able to escape in
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
the future finally i would like to
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
provide some insight as to why we feel
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
it is important for new hampshire to
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
continue to limit lobster harvest to
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
traps only
 
04:26:39.279 --> 04:26:40.550 align:start position:0%
traps only
while

04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
while
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
our states to the south of us allow
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
harvest by other methods including scuba
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to the reasons previously
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned relating to law enforcement
 
04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
the lobster resource itself and the
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
habitat new hampshire is unique in
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
having by far the smallest coastline in
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
the u.s
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
this results in a higher potential for
 
04:27:05.110 --> 04:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
conflicts between
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
the many users of the marine resources
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
in our short coastline
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
so the challenge to
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
coastline has always been to provide
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
access to the state's marine resources
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
while maintaining healthy populations of
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
fish lobsters
 
04:27:21.680 --> 04:27:23.670 align:start position:0%

as well as their habitats
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%

this accomplishment
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
for balancing
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.309 --> 04:27:44.319 align:start position:0%

04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we have actually in the past
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
and currently prohibited such as
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%

again these are to prevent these sort of

04:28:11.110 --> 04:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
in conclusion we want to emphasize that
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire resident can currently
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
harvest lobsters recreational in the
 
04:28:15.520 --> 04:28:17.030 align:start position:0%

04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%

via the five-trap license
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
the department believes the current
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
system of harvesting lobsters by traps
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
provides a uniform enforcement
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity while trying to provide
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
balanced access to the resource
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
you will also hear
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
today from the
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%

who's also opposed to this legislation
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the opportunity to

testify today and the department
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
respectfully urges the committee to
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%

the committee representative smith
 
04:28:59.110 --> 04:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question and a
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
potential follow-up thank you mr
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
testimony i have a follow-up to your
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
comment regarding the lobsters losing
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
claws upon handling
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that something they drop
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
simultaneously upon being touched or is
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
there a lag or is it multiple times or
 
04:29:15.910 --> 04:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
how does it happen
 
04:29:15.920 --> 04:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
how does it happen
so

04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
as you're diving you're trying to grab
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me okay you can trying
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
to grab whatever you
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
you can to grab the lobster right if you
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
grab a claw it will drop its claw if
 
04:29:30.389 --> 04:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're gonna grab one or two you know
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
whatever you're gonna grab to stuff it
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
in your die bag
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
they will they will drop their claws
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
once they drop their claws it's going to
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
take a period of time for regeneration
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
during that period of time of
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
regeneration it's
 
04:29:45.600 --> 04:29:46.790 align:start position:0%
regeneration it's
several

04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
weeks to a couple months
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
and there's you've lost the economic
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
value of that lobster for any of the
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
commercial fishery that's out there at
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
that point in time i don't know when you
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
go to a
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant or to a store
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see culls
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
and they're at a reduced price due to
 
04:30:05.439 --> 04:30:06.309 align:start position:0%
and they're at a reduced price due to
the

04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
lack of one or two claws from that
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
was there another question just a
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that is that i guarantee
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
they lose their claw or is it is i mean
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand if it's every
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
time someone pulls on the claw does it
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
come off
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe not okay yeah okay when i
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
would be out diving and would do
 
04:30:29.590 --> 04:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
something like that during our research
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
further questions from any committee
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
i have one question around actually two
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
but one around the poaching comment you
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
made so cur
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
currently are there any prosecutions for
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
people poaching lobsters from traps are
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
you i'm familiar with any uh scuba
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
divers have
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
have poached uh have ticketed or charged
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
somebody for taking lobsters
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant when you step up to and sit
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
next to your colleague here and you can

04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's gonna hit the button too there we
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
go now lights on
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is

04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
the seacoast district
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
we do not have any current cases pending
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
or charges pending
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it does does happen in the past and
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
we get numerous complaints from the
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen the lobstermen
 
04:31:50.239 --> 04:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen the lobstermen
that

04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
are claiming that uh their traps are
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
getting poached but it's extremely
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay and just one follow-up question so
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
we we heard from representative hill
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
talking about our community to the south
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
has had no reported instances of
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
conflict i think you called it user
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
conflict in in in your testimony um that
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's been no reported cases of user
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
conflict between lobstermen and scuba
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
divers where it's allowed in
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts on their coastline
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
is that is two knowledge is that true is
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
that accurate or is or
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any cases where
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
lobstermen and fish and scuba divers
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
went fisticuffs
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
i i don't know of any information from
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in law enforcement
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
natural resource law and law enforcement
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts i i don't know what
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
they have for information i could
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
certainly inquire and follow up if
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you any further
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:32:45.760 --> 04:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
represent

04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
my question is towards the enforcement
 
04:32:54.720 --> 04:32:56.790 align:start position:0%
my question is towards the enforcement
aspect

04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
we have only 19 miles of our sea
 
04:32:59.279 --> 04:33:00.550 align:start position:0%
we have only 19 miles of our sea
coastline

04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
coastline
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
and some of the neighbors have 100 miles
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
or even more
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh the question is
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
do you think that uh if bill passes you
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
know it's gonna hurt you're gonna have a
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
hard time to
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
enforce the existing law
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
currently we heard that
 
04:33:18.719 --> 04:33:20.551 align:start position:0%
currently we heard that
the

04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
is a highly regulated industry highly
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.840 --> 04:33:29.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that this is my question do
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
you think that you're going to have to
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
open up a new wing of
 
04:33:34.959 --> 04:33:36.390 align:start position:0%
open up a new wing of
enforcement

04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
and within your department
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
we're i'm sure everyone's aware we're
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
very short staffed um i'm currently
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
working with uh
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
three other officers in a district that
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
should be a total of five
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
um in order for us to prosecute
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
or to uh to cite a violation of
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
of uh lobsters being taken out of traps
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
or by hand uh we'd have to witness that
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
that violation um
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult unless we are
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
underwater uh watching the diver as as
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
he's doing it as uh as chief patterson
 
04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
gave in her testimony
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
for us to approach
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
a diver underwater if they had their
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
dive flag up we have to be super super
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
careful with our vessels
 
04:34:24.799 --> 04:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
careful with our vessels
and

04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
getting close enough to observe a
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
violation of this actually happening
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
what is happening is is nearly
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
impossible unfortunately the uh the
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
lobsters aren't good witnesses they
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't have much to testify to
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
um so we'd have we'd have to prove it
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
with other law enforcement methods uh
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
interviewing the
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
lobster harvesters after the fact
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how else to do it it's it's
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's very difficult they're
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
underwater and limited visibility um
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
for other questions for a fish and game
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much for your
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to provide

bill 1297
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
the lobster industry in new hampshire is
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
a valuable economic driver for the state
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
however the lobster resource is
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
presently under a tremendous amount of
 
04:35:56.320 --> 04:35:57.269 align:start position:0%
presently under a tremendous amount of
pressure

04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's pressure from climate change
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
federal government regulations the
 
04:36:03.990 --> 04:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
potential loss of rich fishing grounds
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
due to offshore wind
 
04:36:09.029 --> 04:36:09.039 align:start position:0%
and from fishing pressure itself
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the lobster fishery
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
and the lobster resource has been and
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
will continue to be a top priority for
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
the lobster fishes in this state
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
to execute this commitment to
 
04:36:21.359 --> 04:36:23.269 align:start position:0%
to execute this commitment to
sustainability

04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
lobster fishermen will expend a
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of their gross
 
04:36:27.199 --> 04:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of their gross
income

04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
on the purchases of lobsterbait
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
for example in 2021
 
04:36:33.359 --> 04:36:34.551 align:start position:0%
for example in 2021

04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
24
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
of my gross lobster income went to the
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
purchase of lobsterbait
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
dr robert stennik from the university of
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
maine's lobster institute
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
has conducted studies and in his studies
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
he has found that lobster bait
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
and lobster in lobster traps
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
is the main food supply of lobsters and
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
dr stennik concluded that baited lobster
 
04:36:59.439 --> 04:37:00.390 align:start position:0%
dr stennik concluded that baited lobster
traps

04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
traps
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
may actually be the largest aquaculture
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
effort in the world
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
this research by dr stennik is evidence
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
that baited lobster traps are a key
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
element to lobster sustainability
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
scuba diving for lobsters on the other
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
hand is a deterrent to sustainability
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
after all with diving
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's all take and no give
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
if an activity such as diving does not
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to the sustainability of this
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
resource then it should be prohibited
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
for climate change
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
changing climate conditions are
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
affecting the water temperatures in the
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
gulf of maine more than any other body
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
of water
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
warming temperatures are affecting the
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
juvenile lobster recruitment according
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
to dr richard wally
 
04:37:48.629 --> 04:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
executive director of the university of
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
maine's lobster institute
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
the juvenile lobster settlement
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
is the is peaked and will decline as
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
water temperatures rise above the
 
04:38:01.349 --> 04:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
optimal limits
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
dr wally concluded this decline in
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
juvenile lobster settlement has raised
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
concerns over the future of the region's
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
lobster fishery
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
another concern with warming waters is
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
the migration of large breeding females
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
from inshore habitats to offshore areas
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
north and east where water temperatures
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
are more conducive for breeding
 
04:38:23.039 --> 04:38:24.789 align:start position:0%
are more conducive for breeding
activities

04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%

04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
changing climate conditions in warmer
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%

04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
northwood migration of new lobster
 
04:38:33.039 --> 04:38:34.310 align:start position:0%

04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
predators
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%

black sea bass and trigger fish
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's a higher risk with the warmer
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%

scuba diving philosophers is legal there
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
have been a number of incidences where
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%

cannot afford to lose any of that brood

04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
i would urge this committee to consider
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
the continued prohibition of scuba
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%

04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any

mr i just have one question for you you
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about lops about scuba
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
divers taking
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
egg bearing undersize edge bearing and
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
undersized lobsters massachusetts there
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
was an event in december of 2020 where
 
04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
two divers were caught what 18 lobsters
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
16 of which were undersized and two were
 
04:41:16.000 --> 04:41:17.350 align:start position:0%
16 of which were undersized and two were
egg-bearing

04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
egg-bearing
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge and follow-up is to
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
your knowledge um if we would have that
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
same discussion around lobsterman do you
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
know how many violations there have been
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
can you repeat that please so if we
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that same topic of egg bearing
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
or undersized lobster given the lobster
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
industry do you know how many violations
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
on those same two topics within the
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
current lobster model that i don't
 
04:41:41.520 --> 04:41:42.788 align:start position:0%
current lobster model that i don't
but

04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
if i had my way anybody who would be
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
caught with an egg-bearing female
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
lobsters should be banned for life from
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
fishing in the state
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the time no

type of legislation has come before this
committee

04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee

several times
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%

summed it summed it up and that's the
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
same position that the committee takes
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
they agree with fish and games position
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the committee voted to oppose this
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation i know there are
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
other people that are want to talk so
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%

association with regards to the subject
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
we had we've had the opportunity to

of similar legislation the issues that
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
cause concern still remain and have not

been attended to with the submission of
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
this host bill 1297 while other
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to the bill will
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
reveal important circumstances of the

legitimate and valid concern

this association agrees with those

issues or would like to focus its

comments on two distinct matters
 
04:44:13.280 --> 04:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
comments on two distinct matters
safety

04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
introducing and allowing the ability of
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
scuba divers to take lobsters presents a
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
safety issue that without doubt is
 
04:44:22.240 --> 04:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
safety issue that without doubt is
important

04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
since the law since the commercial trap
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
fishery is long established as a means
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
of to harvest this resource for the
 
04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
general public's consumption the means
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and practice of scuba diving
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
for recreational harvesting creates an
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
operational conflict that can result
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
when both trapped fishermen and scuba
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
divers are in the same location
 
04:44:49.110 --> 04:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
as a trap fisherman is hauling their
 
04:44:49.120 --> 04:44:50.868 align:start position:0%
as a trap fisherman is hauling their
gear

04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
gear
 
04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
possibly a lobster trawl of upwards to
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
10 traps in the same proximity of a
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
scuba diver the lines attaching the gear
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the traps
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
or in the operation of his vessels
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
can have a very negative consequence
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
consequences to the scuba diver
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
as in line entanglement
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
or serious propeller injuries if the
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
diver is forced to surface
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
while neither the trap fisherman or the
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
diver know the exact location of each
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
other or the circumstances that both are
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
experiencing the negative consequences
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
that could result without doubt create
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
possibilities that far outweigh the
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
it would be ultimately disastrous in
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
hindsight to have this
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislation allow these circumstances to
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
unfold and in our opinion presents one
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the most important reasons to oppose
 
04:45:42.878 --> 04:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
of the most important reasons to oppose
it

04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%

04:45:46.320 --> 04:45:49.110 align:start position:0%

concerns

04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
while previous testimony this
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
organization expressed its concerns over
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues the additional burden
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire fish and game
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
officers to monitor compliance issues
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
with scuba divers in the taking of
 
04:46:05.190 --> 04:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
officers presents an additional
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate challenge
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
many circumstances of enforcement
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
require an on-scene presence of these
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
officers and their ability to perform
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
diving surveillance on scuba diving

04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
along the shore or by the boats that
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
scuba divers might use in harvesting
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
lobsters from a logistic matter
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
this might be considered very
 
04:46:28.080 --> 04:46:29.590 align:start position:0%
this might be considered very
overwhelmingly

04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
if not impossible in their capacity for
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
proper enforcement which is a critical
 
04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
part of any legislation
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
placing additional enforcement
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility that would result in
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
considering these legislation dilutes
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
the limited enforcement capability that
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
currently exists and ultimately can harm
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
the resources
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
the resource for those that don't comply
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
these are
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
these are what we feel are the most
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
important reasons to oppose this
 
04:47:02.878 --> 04:47:05.190 align:start position:0%
important reasons to oppose this
legislation

04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:47:06.788 --> 04:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
as said earlier
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
we electronically submitted this
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry and our
 
04:47:10.160 --> 04:47:11.350 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry and our
membership

membership
 
04:47:11.360 --> 04:47:12.230 align:start position:0%
membership
and

04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
our written testimony reflects 14
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
responses that were taken prior to
 
04:47:18.400 --> 04:47:20.470 align:start position:0%
responses that were taken prior to
um

04:47:20.470 --> 04:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:47:21.600 --> 04:47:23.590 align:start position:0%
and and
a

04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
response very recently until this
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
morning that included over 25 full-time
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
lobster fisherman
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so we would oppose this legislation
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
and hope the committee will oppose it in
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
any fashion
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr anderson any
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions for miss anderson
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so every testimony
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
and coming for the fish and game
 
04:47:44.240 --> 04:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
and coming for the fish and game
committee

04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
next up is michael flanagan
 
04:47:50.310 --> 04:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me good afternoon thank you very
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
much for giving me the opportunity to
 
04:48:03.200 --> 04:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
much for giving me the opportunity to
speak

04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:48:06.550 --> 04:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier this morning
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
my brother and i have both been fishing
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
commercially for 66 years we both hold
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
1200 trap licenses
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
my sons have a wholesale
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
air freight business on the waterfront
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
in kittery my whole family is
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
deeply involved
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
seriously financially involved in
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
lobster fishery
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
i've come to concord several times to
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition the skin diving bill
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's ridiculous way to harvest
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
lobsters the baited trap has proven
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
through the industry the only
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to harvest lobsters not
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
sparing not diving not dragging
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the baited trap
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
you folks can relate to this our baited
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
traps are very similar to our bird
 
04:48:44.878 --> 04:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
traps are very similar to our bird
feeders

04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
feeders
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we have i have five vents in my
 
04:48:48.000 --> 04:48:49.190 align:start position:0%
but we have i have five vents in my
traps

04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
traps
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
the lobster of all sizes come in feed
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and swim out like the birds do hopefully
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
the big ones get caught that's the way
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's the way the baited trap works
 
04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
i can go on all afternoon about my
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
experience i've been a lot of places
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
done a lot of things but primarily
 
04:49:03.520 --> 04:49:04.788 align:start position:0%
done a lot of things but primarily
lobstering

04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
lobstering
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
without getting too far afield i like to
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
have about 30 seconds to mention
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
something you people are probably aware
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
of you see it in the news you read about
 
04:49:11.280 --> 04:49:12.070 align:start position:0%
of you see it in the news you read about
it

04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:13.910 --> 04:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's this whale issue
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's a non-issue
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
i've been fishing for 66 years i've
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
never entangled a right whale i know
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
people all up and down the coast every
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
association every group of fishermen i
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't know of anybody that's ever
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
entangled a right whale
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is something that happened years
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
ago with paulie rope and
 
04:49:32.080 --> 04:49:32.868 align:start position:0%
ago with paulie rope and

waters and wildlife
 
04:50:44.550 --> 04:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
we seek to ensure north america's

outdoor heritage of hunting and fishing
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a natural setting by supporting land

conservation public access to hunting

of fish and wildlife and their habitats
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
a core principle of back country owners
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
and anglers is to support the north
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
american model of wildlife conservation
 
04:51:02.550 --> 04:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
this model is the world's most
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
successful system of policies and laws
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
to restore and safeguard fish and
 
04:51:06.080 --> 04:51:07.110 align:start position:0%
to restore and safeguard fish and

and their habitat through sound science

and active management
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
under this model wildlife is held in the
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
public trust and in our state we've
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
entrusted wildlife management duties to
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire fish and game

commission or department
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have also empowered the department
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
with a set of tools including the
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
ability to set season dates
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
limits bag limits length limits and
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate methods of take
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
which combined with current science and
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
biological evidence allow them to
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
effectively manage the state's game
 
04:51:37.600 --> 04:51:39.430 align:start position:0%
effectively manage the state's game

species
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1297 offers an additional method of
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
take by eliminating a
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislative restriction
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
outdoor persons have expressed a desire
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to die for
 
04:51:50.000 --> 04:51:51.110 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to die for
lobsters

04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
lobsters
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
and we support this opportunity and
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
believe that it can be used to help
 
04:51:56.550 --> 04:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
manage the lobster fishery
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
where we find find concern is that the
 
04:52:01.670 --> 04:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill as written will remove essential
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
management tools from the department
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
should be making the decisions on bag
 
04:52:07.360 --> 04:52:08.788 align:start position:0%
should be making the decisions on bag
limits

04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
limits
 
04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
seasons and licensing
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
these decisions need to be motivated and
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
guided by biological evidence and
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
management needs as opposed to public
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
opinion and preference
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
for these reasons on behalf of bha
 
04:52:23.190 --> 04:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
members in new hampshire we ask you to
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
oppose 1297 in its current form and ask
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
the paragraph
 
04:52:29.910 --> 04:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
be amended to put decision making back
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
into the department's controls
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%

scuba diver lobstering if fish and game
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
had the right to manage it and set the
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
regulations around it rather than have
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.190 --> 04:52:59.200 align:start position:0%

as a safe family activity
 
04:54:07.200 --> 04:54:08.230 align:start position:0%
as a safe family activity
but

04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things i wanted to talk to a
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
couple issues that were brought up
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
earlier both the enforcement and safety
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
one of the the conversations i had in
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
preparing for this hearing i did have
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
some conversations with the uh some of
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals from environmental
 
04:54:25.910 --> 04:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
police in massachusetts and uh
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
and from the department of marine
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
fisheries i think that's what they're
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
called the dmf the dive safety officer
 
04:54:31.760 --> 04:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
called the dmf the dive safety officer
and

04:54:32.550 --> 04:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
i completely understand the concerns
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
about enforcement and the number of
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
resources that we have to to uh police
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
police this uh one of the things that i
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
specifically discussed with them was
 
04:54:42.560 --> 04:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
specifically discussed with them was
that

04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:43.520 --> 04:54:44.868 align:start position:0%
that
the

04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
the environmental police in
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts really don't allocate
 
04:54:50.550 --> 04:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
specific amount of time for
 
04:54:50.560 --> 04:54:51.270 align:start position:0%
specific amount of time for
uh

04:54:51.270 --> 04:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
for policing uh diving for for uh
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
recreationally for lobsters what they do
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
is they look at this as part of their
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
overall regular policing activities so
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
when they do a board and they're looking
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
at a boat they're checking for permits
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're checking if you're going for
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
scallops they're looking at the size of
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
scallops if you're diving for lobsters
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the size lobsters if
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
you're fishing they're checking for all
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
all that stuff so the point is that
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know they
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to be that much
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
of a burden um to local enforcement but
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to add was that
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the comment on
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
poaching in massachusetts yes there are
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
bad eggs we know that um
 
04:55:29.910 --> 04:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
in even here in new hampshire um they're
 
04:55:29.920 --> 04:55:30.948 align:start position:0%
in even here in new hampshire um they're
usually

04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
usually
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
isolated individuals that are diving
 
04:55:33.670 --> 04:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
alone that
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
um that are just doing something they
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
in general they're stewards of the ocean
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're typically policing each
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
other you're usually as you know diving
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
not by yourself but with buddies and
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're constantly in the water if you're
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to see someone doing anything
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
illegal approaching a pot uh taking
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
lobsters i mean we'll be the first to
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
to report
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
those types of activities
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the issue of of safety
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
house representative greg hill pointed
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
out there have been really no uh
 
04:56:11.040 --> 04:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
out there have been really no uh
incidents

04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
um documented of accidents uh
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
recreational divers um while uh diving
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
for lobsters i
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
use the example of uh
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
of a commercial officer and pulling up a
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
chain of pots and a diver getting pulled
 
04:56:25.680 --> 04:56:26.390 align:start position:0%
chain of pots and a diver getting pulled
up

04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
these are things that typically the
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
divers tend me personally when i'm going
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
out especially with my family if i see
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm not going to choose to go on a
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
dive site where people are fishing where
 
04:56:37.840 --> 04:56:39.350 align:start position:0%
dive site where people are fishing where
known

04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
known
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
fishing activities in place for that
 
04:56:42.868 --> 04:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
reason because we don't want to you in
 
04:56:44.550 --> 04:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
general with diving you just don't dive
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
where they're boats it's just a common
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
sense so you want to try and stay away
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
from that area so um
 
04:56:52.390 --> 04:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm trying to
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
also point out is where we dive we
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
purposely try to dive in areas um that
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no boat traffic so if you
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
look at the coast of new hampshire it's
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
very similar a lot of similarities to
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
cape cod it's very shallow and to get
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
any depth you have to really swim out
 
04:57:07.280 --> 04:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
any depth you have to really swim out
far

04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
far
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
um that's where the boats are so where
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
diving would be in intertidal areas if
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
you think of the new hampshire coastline
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
places like off of odeon point um
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
at high tide you're lucky to get maybe
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
um eight nine feet where boats are not
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to be uh fishing if you're diving
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
there are sections in the um
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
like for example the piscataqua river
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
there are deep sections yes
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
but where commercial lobstermen are
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
probably fishing but are fishing but and
 
04:57:39.910 --> 04:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
dropping uh lines and trawls but we're
 
04:57:39.920 --> 04:57:40.708 align:start position:0%
dropping uh lines and trawls but we're
not

04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
in those sections because we're very
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
close into the shore where the boats are
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
not going to be hauling up lobster pots
 
04:57:48.160 --> 04:57:48.868 align:start position:0%
not going to be hauling up lobster pots
so

04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:50.550 --> 04:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
04:57:52.470 --> 04:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone understood that
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
where we dive is in an area where um
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
where there's there's generally not a
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot of boat traffic
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing is i also wanted to i
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
know that we do have the ability to get
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
lobsters with a tent pot
 
04:58:10.550 --> 04:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have a boat and many of us
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
don't have a boat and this is something
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
that we feel is a resource that should
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
be enjoyed by um by
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
just as i could as a
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh scuba dive for uh scallops or or
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
other things um
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
this is something that i just wanted to
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
to point out about the uh uh
 
04:58:33.030 --> 04:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
that i think it's something that
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
should be considered what we're putting
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
forward is kind of a compromise is kind
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
of you'll see at the end of this period
 
04:58:38.638 --> 04:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
of you'll see at the end of this period
um

04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh incidents that are
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to be enforcement issues or
 
04:58:46.628 --> 04:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
accidents and so or the
 
04:58:49.030 --> 04:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
impact to the populations could be
 
04:58:49.040 --> 04:58:50.230 align:start position:0%
impact to the populations could be
negligible

04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
negligible
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing i just wanted to also
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
talk about is
 
04:58:55.030 --> 04:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is very important there was a lot
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
of discussion about damaged lobsters and
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
the claws being pulled and so on i
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to let everyone know that scuba
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
diving for lobsters is less passive in
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
my opinion than lobstering with pots
 
04:59:04.948 --> 04:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
with minimal
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
disturbance the environment um if i have
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
a tent pot license or a one pot license
 
04:59:12.150 --> 04:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
when i'm pulling up my lobster pots out
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
of the water those pots are being
 
04:59:16.550 --> 04:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
dragged um and disturbing the rocks and
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
so on um on the on the bottom as they're
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
being pulled up the other thing is that
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
as i bring up my pots if i see shorts or
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i see egg bearing or v-notch uh any
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
ones that we cannot keep we have to
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
throw them back so uh i would be
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
throwing them back into the water and
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
during that period they'd be susceptible
 
04:59:36.798 --> 04:59:37.830 align:start position:0%
during that period they'd be susceptible
to

04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
predators such as
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
striped bass and and then there's the
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
time that they would need to find to get
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
to a safe area um me as i uh my
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
experience diving for lobsters the which
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
when you're in there you're going to
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
find a lobster you're going to see one
 
04:59:53.280 --> 04:59:54.310 align:start position:0%
find a lobster you're going to see one
um

04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to see that it's it's
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
short you're not going to take it if
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a short but even if you
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
pull it out and you see that it's uh egg
 
05:00:03.190 --> 05:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
bearing you're going to leave it where
 
05:00:04.550 --> 05:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
it is you're going to put it back it's
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to be back in a safe area
 
05:00:06.798 --> 05:00:07.590 align:start position:0%
it's going to be back in a safe area
um

05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
anyone that typically dies for lobsters
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
you're not picking up um as we heard the
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
testimony picking up rocks and lifting
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
up rocks and it's just not the way it's
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
done because the moment you lift up the
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
rock that lobster is going to swim away
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you know but they
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
can swim pretty fast with a couple kicks
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the fin they're like 25 30 feet by
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
the time you can get to them they're
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
already in another
 
05:00:33.030 --> 05:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
safe hole or something like that
 
05:00:34.948 --> 05:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
you don't grab them from the claws
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's the last thing you want to do for
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
that reason because you're going to pull
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
the claws off and you know even me as a
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
diver bringing up a lobster with the
 
05:00:44.550 --> 05:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
claws off the you know the
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
the claws eventually degrade by the time
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
you get home it's they're just not as
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
good so it's just something we just know
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
not to do um the way that we safely die
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
for lobsters and you know we use things
 
05:00:57.030 --> 05:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
like tickle sticks so you try and coax
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
it out from behind um
 
05:01:02.070 --> 05:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
and try and get it out and take and look
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
at it grab it but the last thing you're
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to do is just you know pull it
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
rock so
 
05:01:07.760 --> 05:01:08.948 align:start position:0%
rock so
um

05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
so that's really all i just wanted out
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
is just to kind of um refute those
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
comments but i i just
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know again this is something that
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's something that i would envision um
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
in my lifetime being able to do you know
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
as a family activity and and uh i think
 
05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
it would drive more uh revenue to the
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
state in terms of uh business for dive
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
shops for get more people open water
 
05:01:29.200 --> 05:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
shops for get more people open water
certified

05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
certified
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
more training buying more gear
 
05:01:33.440 --> 05:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
more training buying more gear
um

05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
i mean candidly it's not
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a cheap activity i mean if you
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
think of the gas and the the you know
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
bank for air the rental gear etc it's
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
probably cheaper to go to market basket
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about coming home with
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
when i do go diving with my family it's
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
probably at the most two to three
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you know over the course of a day
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr figueroa uh
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
represent has a question for you
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and put an amendment
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
that would set the dates and season
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
seasons and bag limits in the control of
 
05:02:09.750 --> 05:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm open to it this is something the
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
diving community is open to work with to
 
05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
um because we recognize that this is
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
something that we want to demonstrate at
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
the end either a limited season
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
or a number catch um that the data is
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to show that some of the concerns
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
that are are being brought are our mood
 
05:02:26.480 --> 05:02:27.350 align:start position:0%
that are are being brought are our mood
point

05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:02:30.868 --> 05:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
we're flexible with uh
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
with looking at uh you know any type of
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
proposals that you think are fair
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
05:02:38.160 --> 05:02:39.510 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:02:41.110 --> 05:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
there being none thank you very much sir
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it our last speaker on this
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
weldon bosworth
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
um from guilford and he's in favor of
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:56.550 --> 05:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee i uh this isn't the main
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
reason i came down here today but
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a subject near and dear to
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
my heart i did want to testify to it
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
my background is i'm a marine biologist
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
with 50 years experience
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
in ecology marine ecology and
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
environmental impact
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
in addition to that i've had over 100
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
hours hundreds of hours actually diving
 
05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
along the new hampshire coast when i was
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
running all the
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
biological studies for seabrook station
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
i had almost 25 divers working for me
 
05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
who collectively over the years had over
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
30 000 hours of diving so i'm listening
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
here i'm hearing a mountain being made
 
05:03:38.230 --> 05:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
out of a molehill this bill proposes two
 
05:03:38.240 --> 05:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
out of a molehill this bill proposes two
months

05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
out of a year
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the diving
 
05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
community is now but i doubt there's a
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
hundred people in new hampshire
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
that would get involved in diving for
 
05:03:47.120 --> 05:03:48.948 align:start position:0%
that would get involved in diving for
lobsters

05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
lobsters
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
using scuba or free diving
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
i grew up in the 60s down in
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts diving for lobster so
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
everything the previous speaker said
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.240 --> 05:04:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
the thing that i really want to i guess
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that there is not a safety
 
05:04:08.480 --> 05:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that there is not a safety
issue

05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
and these
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of hours of diving
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
we only had one incident over 20 years
 
05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
of somebody getting bent people who dive
 
05:04:20.708 --> 05:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
in these kind of climates and there's
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
very few that do
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
are well aware and cautious about safety
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to be diving
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
around boats and lobster pots and things
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
like that first of all if you've got
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
bubbles near a lobster part
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
the uh lobsterman already presumes that
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're down there poaching which is not
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the truth and i've
 
05:04:41.670 --> 05:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
certainly seen that happen
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
last time i looked lobsters are a
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
species held in public trust by
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
all citizens in new hampshire
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i think the option
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
to take lobsters using either traps
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
or by scuba or skin diving
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
is a choice made just like in hunting
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
one can go after it with firearms or bow
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
and arrow in some cases crossbow
 
05:05:05.920 --> 05:05:06.628 align:start position:0%
and arrow in some cases crossbow
so

05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
anyway that's my say on the situation of
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
diving for lobsters thank you mr
 
05:05:13.270 --> 05:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
bosworth appreciate your testimony is
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
for mr busworth
 
05:05:18.550 --> 05:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
there being none mr basra thank you
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
again for coming for the fish and game
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee that concludes our speakers on
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
um given its topic i'm not going to
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
consider going into an executive session
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
we'll give time for members to see if
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
they want to work up an amendment on
 
05:05:29.920 --> 05:05:30.750 align:start position:0%
they want to work up an amendment on
that

05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:33.910 --> 05:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
541a rule-making authority maybe
 
05:05:35.190 --> 05:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
and see how we want to progress and
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
we'll meet on the 25th to discuss it
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
further with that i will close the
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%

05:06:55.990 --> 05:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
name is tim lang i represent the towns
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
of uh tilton and san bernardino iv
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm presenting to you a bill that
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
would um that's relevant to the process
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
of importation of wildlife and then
 
05:07:06.550 --> 05:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
creating an appeal process
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is before you based on a
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
constituent request
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
i was contacted by a member of the
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizen who was trying to
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
work through a process for importing
 
05:07:17.200 --> 05:07:19.190 align:start position:0%
work through a process for importing
reindeer

05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
reindeer
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
and through that process we're hitting
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
some hurdles and we're having a more
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
difficult time and as i read the law
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
that he was citing
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
i realized i didn't like it and so i
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
presented i was bringing a bill forward
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
if you read the statute as it exists
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
right now the statute defaults to no for
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
our citizen instead of defaulting to yes
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
for our citizen
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and so i felt that that was an
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
inappropriate default for our laws that
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
we should be encouraging our citizens to
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
participate and do whatever they want in
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
their in our community with it if it's
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
within our reasons so the default answer
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
i felt should been yes so you'll see
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
that i strike the language where it says
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
no person shall import and i change it
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
to a person may import
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but there's still a permitting
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
process right so we still want to give
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
fish and game the right
 
05:08:05.440 --> 05:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
fish and game the right
to

05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no conflict or
 
05:08:10.628 --> 05:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
problem with the importation of whatever
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
kind of animal the person's trying to
 
05:08:12.240 --> 05:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
kind of animal the person's trying to
import

05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
import
 
05:08:16.470 --> 05:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and so we give fish fish and game a
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
30-day window from the time the person
 
05:08:21.990 --> 05:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
asks for the permit to respond if they
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't respond within 30 days the default
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
answer is yes if they respond within 30
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
days and deny
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
then there's the person can either
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
accept based on the reasoning that fish
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and game gave the person for the denial
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
or i created the new appeal process
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
because there is no current appeal
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
process for a denial unless you want to
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
go to superior court and start involving
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
lawyers so i created a simple appeal
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
process that allows an individual
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
citizen who disagrees with the decision
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the executive director to be able to
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
just appeal to the fish and game
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
commission and file an appeal saying i
 
05:08:56.550 --> 05:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
think i was denied i was denied this
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
permit unduly i want to present my case
 
05:09:00.550 --> 05:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the fish and game commission and let
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
the fish and game commission which is
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
the ruling body of fish and game two and
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
policy body efficient game to make a
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
ruling on whether or not the executive
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
director's decision should be overturned
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's the bill
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
that's what it does
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
um there is an amendment to the bill
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
which you all have um i made one change
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
which was basically i granted um 541
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
rule making authority which i left out
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
of my original bill to give fish and
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
game the ability to write rules around
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the process
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions again i
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
i felt it was
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
it was a disservice to our citizen to
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
not have a good process in place to not
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a ability to appeal a bureaucrats
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
no offense cut but a bureaucrat's uh
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
fiat ruling and there should be a
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
process to appeal that that a citizen
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
can take and not have to go to superior
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
court and open a case and do that so the
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh so i established an appeal process
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
with the fish and game commission
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take any
 
05:09:59.920 --> 05:10:00.948 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take any
questions

05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%

seek to strengthen it rather than

these risks are real and there are
 
05:14:40.628 --> 05:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
dozens of examples of injurious

non-native species in the united states

feral pigs
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
just to name a few
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
moving native species can have similar
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
risks as importing non-native species
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
particularly with disease transmission
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
for example some native amphibians in
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%

for the moose and deer so important to
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hunters and all others who
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
cherish our native cervids chronic
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
wasting disease or cwd
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
is one of these potential disease
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
disasters cwd has already taken hold in
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country and it makes
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
big gains when people move infected
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
animals and tissues between states
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
cwd is always fatal to the infected
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
animal and many hunters have serious
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
concerns about feeding meat from
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
infected animals to their families
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
as cwd prevalence increases in a state
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
it can depress hunter participation
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
which in turn affects hunting license
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
sales and revenue for state wildlife
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
management agencies
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
given all these examples decisions about
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
the activities in hb 1299 should not be
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
made lightly or in haste science-based
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
decisions can protect and manage our
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
native habitats and wildlife however the
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
information required for these decisions
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
isn't always readily available and the
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
department will need time to determine
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether a proposal qualifies for
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
approval or denial
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why this could be
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
the case depending on the biology of the
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
species at issue and the risks to new
 
05:16:08.470 --> 05:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's wildlife demand we give the
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
experts the time and discretion they
 
05:16:10.000 --> 05:16:10.868 align:start position:0%
experts the time and discretion they
need

05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
the default answers to requests for
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
import possession release etc of species
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire should be that it is
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited unless allowed by the
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
department the current language gives
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the department the appropriate time and
 
05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
discretion to make the best decision for
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
our fish wildlife inhabitants for these
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
reasons on behalf of vha's members in
 
05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we ask that you oppose
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you all for the
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today and for
 
05:16:36.310 --> 05:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
taking our comments into consideration
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
can we get a copy of that so that we can
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
make copies for the committee thank you
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you if nobody else
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.750 --> 05:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
are you aware that under the way that
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
the bill's written a fish and game can
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually still deny the permit under all
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
of those reasons that you mentioned okay
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
they it just gives a hearing as a
 
05:17:00.550 --> 05:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirement and a default answer of yes
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
next up i have dan bergeron
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
you do have uh 20 copies for us
 
05:17:26.070 --> 05:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and members of
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
um so yes i'm dan bergeron the chief of
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
the wildlife division for fish and game
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm here opposing the bill
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
for the department and the commission
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
so the department has several concerns
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
negative impacts to native species
 
05:17:51.250 --> 05:17:51.260 align:start position:0%
and their habitats in the state so
 
05:17:51.260 --> 05:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
and their habitats in the state so
[Music]

05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill again it does not only
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
relate to importation uh but also the
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
potential possession sale and exhibition
 
05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
and release of wildlife
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
or their eggs or progeny
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
so currently the current rsa
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
and the existing administrative rules
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
which are in part fis 800
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
those rules were were created using the
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
best available science
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
to minimize the risk of
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
introduction of diseases or escape
 
05:18:24.878 --> 05:18:25.670 align:start position:0%
introduction of diseases or escape
of

05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
so in those rules there are categories
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
that are outlined for the different
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
types of permatease
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
the different categories of species so
 
05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
there are certain species that are
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
considered controlled
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
non-controlled species or prohibited
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
species and depending on what category
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
of permatea you are or the category of
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
the species
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that dictates what you're allowed to
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
bring in and then what you're allowed to
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
do with it
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
once it gets into the state
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
and again those categories are already
 
05:18:58.230 --> 05:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
based off of research that was done on
 
05:18:59.910 --> 05:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
the risks associated with these
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
so again i mentioned it briefly you know
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
the big concerns are introduction of
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
wildlife diseases
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
or invasive species but also loss of
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
genetic diversity to some of the state's
 
05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
threatened and endangered species
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns at least i have i
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to read the
 
05:19:22.638 --> 05:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to read the
amendment

05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
but with the original
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
language of this bill but we had
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
concerns of what this might do to our
 
05:19:29.760 --> 05:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
concerns of what this might do to our
authority

05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:19:31.360 --> 05:19:32.390 align:start position:0%
authority
to

05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
to enforce these 800 rules
 
05:19:36.550 --> 05:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill
 
05:19:36.560 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill
currently

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
again i haven't had a chance to review
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment but the language removes
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
part of the existing rsa that gives the
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
executive director and i quote the
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
authority to determine the time period
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
and any other conditions governing the
 
05:19:53.110 --> 05:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
issuance of this permit um and those
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
other conditions are largely what make
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
up the the bulk of our 800 rules which
 
05:19:57.040 --> 05:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
up the the bulk of our 800 rules which
were

05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:19:59.910 --> 05:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
are very extensive rules that kind of
 
05:20:02.550 --> 05:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
guide this process there's um
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
you know it makes sure we're required
 
05:20:07.830 --> 05:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're following federal guidelines um
 
05:20:10.390 --> 05:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's information on there on housing
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
for different species so it's an
 
05:20:14.470 --> 05:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
extensive set of rules that guides our
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
decisions on these
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we issue a permit for
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns about the appeals
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
process as well
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
when the commission voted on this they
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to oppose it
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they stated at the time that they
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
did not feel that they had the they
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
should have the authority to adjudicate
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
these hearings
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
in part because they did not feel they
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
had the expertise or experience to do
 
05:20:40.560 --> 05:20:41.990 align:start position:0%
had the expertise or experience to do
such

05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:20:42.000 --> 05:20:42.948 align:start position:0%
such
currently

05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:20:44.550 --> 05:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
the commission does not have the
 
05:20:44.560 --> 05:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
the commission does not have the
authority

05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
um to hear any other sorts of hearings
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
so license revocation hearings for
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
example the commission does not does not
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
have the authority to to hear those
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
i did notice that that was specifically
 
05:20:58.550 --> 05:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
written into this bill to allow that but
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
but the commission took the position
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
that they did not feel that was in their
 
05:21:01.280 --> 05:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
that they did not feel that was in their
preview

05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:06.550 --> 05:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
we also feel that this would
 
05:21:08.470 --> 05:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
increase workload
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
um again the rules in place are fairly
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
streamlined um
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know depending on your the permit
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
category that you're applying for and
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
the type of species you're looking
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
to import
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
decisions are somewhat already made and
 
05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
the science and the background research
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
was done on that already
 
05:21:29.120 --> 05:21:29.910 align:start position:0%
was done on that already
this

05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
i could foresee turning into a situation
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
where we are litigating individual cases
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
when when permits are denied despite the
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
fact that we have already based these
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
the risks again if something were to
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
to get through
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i do feel like this bill increases
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
the risks are pretty substantial to
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
native wildlife in the state and their
 
05:21:57.680 --> 05:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
native wildlife in the state and their
habitats

05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
habitats
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
disease transmission is is one of the
 
05:22:02.948 --> 05:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
big ones chronic wasting disease was
 
05:22:04.708 --> 05:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are other diseases like
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
bovine tuberculosis
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of diseases that
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
impact reptiles and amphibians so
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
chytrid fungus was mentioned
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
ranavirus snake fungal disease
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
still there's a number of other diseases
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
that impact fresh water and marine
 
05:22:18.480 --> 05:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
that impact fresh water and marine
species

05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
species
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
so both our inland fisheries division
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
in our marine fisheries division has
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
very big concerns about this
 
05:22:29.270 --> 05:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
some diseases can be zoonotic
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
which means they have the potential to
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
impact both wildlife and humans
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
a good example of this and forgive me
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
for mentioning covet again
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
but but the recent discovery of covet
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
antibodies in whitetail deer
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
as well of a number of other wildlife
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
species and domestic species mink for
 
05:22:45.840 --> 05:22:47.590 align:start position:0%
species and domestic species mink for
example

05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think highlights how disease ecology
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
is constantly changing
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
and responding to
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
responding to introductions of diseases
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
is very costly so
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
for chronic wasted disease for example
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
states spend tens of millions of dollars
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
to try and contain that disease
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
increased monitoring and surveillance
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it's an always fatal disease
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
virtually no jurisdiction has been able
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
to eradicate it once it has arrived it
 
05:23:25.350 --> 05:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
is essentially a process of slowing the
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
and again it was mentioned in previous
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
when some when new diseases
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
when new diseases arrive there can be
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
resulting decreases in license sales and
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue in that that respect as
 
05:23:41.680 --> 05:23:43.750 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue in that that respect as
well

05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:23:45.990 --> 05:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
an escape of invasive species is another
 
05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
big concern
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
likewise with with dealing with disease
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
introductions invasive species
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation it's rarely effective at
 
05:23:57.990 --> 05:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
completely restoring natural systems and
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
there was a study in 2005 which
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
estimated that the united states
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
spends about 120 billion dollars
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
annually to combat impacts from invasive
 
05:24:08.160 --> 05:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
annually to combat impacts from invasive
species

05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
species
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
um again there's a number of species
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
that are on the the prohibited lists
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we currently have under our 800
 
05:24:16.080 --> 05:24:16.948 align:start position:0%
that we currently have under our 800
rules

05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
um and again these species are on that
 
05:24:20.550 --> 05:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
list because there's a well-documented
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
history of the of their
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
potential to have negative and invasive
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
impacts so things like zebra mussels
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
snakehead fish
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
so again the department feels that the
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
current rsa and our administrative rules
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
are an effective and efficient method of
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
permit issuance
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the current rules were developed in
 
05:24:45.430 --> 05:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
advance using the best available science
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
to make decisions on which species
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
should be allowed in the state
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
or be exhibited or sold or released
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
and they provide an efficient and a
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
streamlined process for permanent
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
issuance for the department
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so with that i thank you for the
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
05:25:03.990 --> 05:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
05:25:08.230 --> 05:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative laflamme
 
05:25:10.230 --> 05:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spelaine uh mr
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
roger i have one question and possibly a
 
05:25:12.400 --> 05:25:13.430 align:start position:0%
roger i have one question and possibly a
follow-up

05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
um would you be involved
 
05:25:20.230 --> 05:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
in any sort of um a
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
judging whether or not a request was
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
valid or yeah so it would depend on the
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
species but whatever species was in
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
question we'd likely have to pull in
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
staff that specializes in that species
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:25:34.550 --> 05:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
to help inform the commission on the
 
05:25:34.560 --> 05:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
to help inform the commission on the
decision

05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up agree do you feel
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
that this permit has to be issued within
 
05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
30 days do you think 30 days is a long
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
enough period for you to effectively
 
05:25:45.520 --> 05:25:46.628 align:start position:0%
enough period for you to effectively
evaluate

05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not you should be grinding a
 
05:25:48.000 --> 05:25:49.670 align:start position:0%
whether or not you should be grinding a
permit

05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
permit
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i think it would depend on the species
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
in question
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and again not knowing exactly what this
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
will how this will make will force us to
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
change our current 800 rules um it's
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
tough to say
 
05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh our law enforcement division um
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
does a lot of the permitting but in
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
large part because we've already done
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
the review when we set the guidelines
 
05:26:14.550 --> 05:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
for for again which species should be
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
should be allowed in so if there's a
 
05:26:18.070 --> 05:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
species on the prohibited list it simply
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to be imported
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
so it's very simple that way
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
if a species is on the controlled list
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
then based on what permit category
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
you're in whether or not you're going to
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
propagate that species or just exhibit
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
that species or if you're going to sell
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
that species then that changes what
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to bring in and what
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do with it so again
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of framework in
 
05:26:42.150 --> 05:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
place to make this a very simple process
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
to permit
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
and and the other benefit of having this
 
05:26:48.070 --> 05:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
this this
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
this detail in our administrative rules
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
is that we can change things and adjust
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
things through through the
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process as new
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
science becomes available so if there's
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
evidence that a species um
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
is a greater threat we could put it on a
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited list
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
if there's a if there's
 
05:27:07.350 --> 05:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that maybe something's not as
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
big of a risk we could move it to
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
control for example
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
so it allows us some flexibility too
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
through the administrative rules process
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
to adjust this thing as new science
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony i just took
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
the line 18 where it says the permit
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
shall be granted within 30 days of the
 
05:27:29.920 --> 05:27:31.270 align:start position:0%
shall be granted within 30 days of the
request

05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
um if that permit can't be issued within
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
30 days because it's some exotic
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
species that you're unfamiliar with
 
05:27:40.470 --> 05:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take you 45 days what
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
would you do
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
in that situation would you then deny
 
05:27:46.390 --> 05:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
the permit if this bill passed
 
05:27:46.400 --> 05:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
the permit if this bill passed
or

05:27:47.750 --> 05:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
is there an ability for you to extend
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that 30 days that you see
 
05:27:53.760 --> 05:27:56.708 align:start position:0%
beyond that 30 days that you see
um

05:27:56.708 --> 05:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i'm not sure i follow
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
that so under this bill we would we
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
would be required to respond within the
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
30 days correct
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
but if it's going to take you 45 days
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
so are you asking if we had 45 days
 
05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
would that be sufficient
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
no i'm asking
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
it says the permit shall be granted
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of the request if you're
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
not capable of completing the
 
05:28:24.390 --> 05:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
application within 30 days what is your
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
recourse at that point yeah
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
well to be safe probably to deny the
 
05:28:28.798 --> 05:28:32.708 align:start position:0%
well to be safe probably to deny the
permit

05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
i would i would assume that within that
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
period of time we could probably make a
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
decision um in large part because again
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of this background research has
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
been done on these species uh i i see
 
05:28:47.590 --> 05:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
the time frame is less of an issue
 
05:28:49.030 --> 05:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
any other question
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative craig
 
05:28:54.548 --> 05:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr bergeron
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps you mentioned this and i missed
 
05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
it because i was reading the bill
 
05:29:01.590 --> 05:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
how many permits
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
applications does the department receive
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement division issues most
 
05:29:13.510 --> 05:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
it varies depending on the species
 
05:29:16.400 --> 05:29:19.270 align:start position:0%
it varies depending on the species
um

05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah colonel do you have a calling for
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
yeah or or bob but our administrative
 
05:29:25.110 --> 05:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant who who issues those permits
 
05:29:28.390 --> 05:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
is fairly new to the position okay
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
the former administrative lieutenant did
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i have him doing other things so i
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
issue those and we do issue a great
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
number of them uh representative craig
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
we do issue a great number of them so
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
and they vary from
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
uh rattlesnakes to deer or elk or things
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
of that species of that nature so
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes on there's a lot
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
more than i thought once i started doing
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
the permits
 
05:29:54.000 --> 05:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
the permits
follow-up

05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh and how many of those would you
 
05:29:57.120 --> 05:29:58.628 align:start position:0%
uh and how many of those would you
consider

05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
hard judgments are problematic are a
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
good percentage of them
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
fairly automatic or
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
rejected out of hand how does that go
 
05:30:11.430 --> 05:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
so a lot of them we've established with
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
the help of of uh
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
the sole work of the wildlife staff
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
we've established what is safe and what
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
isn't so
 
05:30:21.110 --> 05:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing that comes in so
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
typically if someone puts in for
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
something for instance a reindeer where
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have real concerns about cwd hitting
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:30:28.240 --> 05:30:29.190 align:start position:0%
the state
um

05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh that we deny that so that's been
 
05:30:33.040 --> 05:30:34.310 align:start position:0%
uh that we deny that so that's been
established

05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
established
 
05:30:34.320 --> 05:30:35.190 align:start position:0%
established
so

05:30:35.190 --> 05:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
we review each application you know as
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
they come in but we've got a pretty good
 
05:30:42.548 --> 05:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
a pretty good handle i think on what is
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay and what it hasn't been what's
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
controlled and what isn't and even on
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
the on the things that we allow in their
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
control there are certain other
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirements health certificates
 
05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
for stuff being imported and propagated
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
cage size and design treatment of the
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
animal all of those things have to be
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
all those standards have to be met or we
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't we don't issue the permit
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it's an involved
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know i'm sitting back there
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
listening to this 30-day window it's an
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
involved process sometimes uh you know
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
and when you've got to send an officer
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
out to inspect an enclosure with the
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
demands on their time now that's a that
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:26.150 --> 05:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
i have one um there's a lot of of um
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
discussion that you had um
 
05:31:37.750 --> 05:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
about about the the complications of the
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
different levels of the permits and such
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that a lot of that is
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
already set out already defined
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
and that you already have rules and
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
process that this doesn't touch
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
it seems to me this bill is mainly just
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
requiring that you be responsive as an
 
05:31:54.638 --> 05:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
requiring that you be responsive as an
organization

05:31:55.910 --> 05:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
and either give a hearing or give an
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
appeals process and that this is only
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
that some response is given and some
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of explanation and
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
hearing is allowed
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.868 --> 05:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
again i haven't read the amendment
 
05:32:16.878 --> 05:32:17.670 align:start position:0%
again i haven't read the amendment
i

05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
do have concerns about the removal of
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
some of the the current language in the
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
rule um
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
that allowed the executive director
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
authority to set out different um
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
criteria for for the issuance of these
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
permits um i'm not sure if the amendment
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
addressed that
 
05:32:35.360 --> 05:32:36.868 align:start position:0%
addressed that
um

05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:36.878 --> 05:32:38.070 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
i think if there were an appeals process
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
i i guess the department would question
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not the commission is the
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate body to hear those appeals
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:32:57.670 --> 05:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:00.868 --> 05:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
next i have eric anderson from the new
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%

fisherman's association
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill and you say you've got
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay you only had 10 copies though
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
we'll make copies
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
we'll make copies no problem
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and house
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee members um
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have reviewed this bill
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
and and stand in opposition of it
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
um in essence this legislation would
 
05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
allow the imputation and release of live
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
marine species or wildlife or eggs or
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
progeny thereof obtaining a permit from
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
05:33:46.628 --> 05:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
our opposition on this part of the
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislation legislation is for
 
05:33:52.708 --> 05:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
introducing a foreign native species
 
05:33:53.750 --> 05:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
into the
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
habitat and ecosystem of our native
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
species can have very controversial and
 
05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
negative effects that are irreversible
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
or uncontrollable
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
i use one example that maybe you're
 
05:34:09.030 --> 05:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
it it it was was by accident but it was
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
a non-native species
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
introduced in this area and that's green
 
05:34:15.680 --> 05:34:16.708 align:start position:0%
introduced in this area and that's green
crabs

05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
crabs
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
um they pretty much were introduced by
 
05:34:18.958 --> 05:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
um they pretty much were introduced by
accident

05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
accident
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
but the consequences have been
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable they have been
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
irreversible um
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
they've caused great you know
 
05:34:31.110 --> 05:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
controversy and great ring um
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the great bay estuary down in hampton
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
seabrook uh and they've overrun
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
and you know because they um
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
they destroy eelgrass
 
05:34:42.000 --> 05:34:43.030 align:start position:0%
they destroy eelgrass
um

05:34:43.030 --> 05:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that's an example of
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
how something can develop without the
 
05:34:47.200 --> 05:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
how something can develop without the
proper

05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
proper
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge and then
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
turn around and become such a negative
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
of additional concern in this
 
05:35:01.270 --> 05:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is the process of appeal as
 
05:35:01.280 --> 05:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
legislation is the process of appeal as
described

05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think i think you might have
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
understood from the previous testimony
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
that the appeal would go to go through
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
fish and game commission
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it's with no malice to that
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
commission but is beyond their authority
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i think it's pretty well stated
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislation that's where any
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
appeal would go and it's just strictly
 
05:35:24.718 --> 05:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
appeal would go and it's just strictly
because

05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:35:28.548 --> 05:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
um with respect to that commission
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
it's beyond the orthotic it's beyond
 
05:35:30.638 --> 05:35:31.670 align:start position:0%
it's beyond the orthotic it's beyond
their

05:35:31.670 --> 05:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge to
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
grant any type of appeal process
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
so we join our opposition with the new
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%

05:37:10.830 --> 05:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
be back even our democratic friends
 
05:37:10.840 --> 05:37:12.788 align:start position:0%
be back even our democratic friends
um

05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:17.190 --> 05:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's great it is great being here i've
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
got to say
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
but anyway this bill
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
is really about power
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
or authority
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
in other words there's one man in the
 
05:37:27.670 --> 05:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game that's saying yes or no how
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
high you jump how
 
05:37:31.270 --> 05:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
whether you jump and things like that
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
but is this not a unique process
 
05:37:35.670 --> 05:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the real estate commission
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the the managers the directors there you
 
05:37:38.548 --> 05:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
can appeal it to the real estate
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
commission any decision that they make
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission as it relates to
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
revocation can be
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
heard in front of the liquor
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i personally had to go
 
05:37:50.868 --> 05:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
in front of the timber tax committee
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
because of various processes that took
 
05:37:55.190 --> 05:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
place at even at a local level so this
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
is not a new concept of having an appeal
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
process going to a commission or a
 
05:38:00.320 --> 05:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
process going to a commission or a
committee

05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
all right so everybody seems to be
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
saying well you know we're afraid of
 
05:38:07.990 --> 05:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
this this this disease or this illness
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we're really only talking about
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
giving somebody a step before
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
they have to take it to a superior court
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
someone also brought up the issue about
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
them not knowing well
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
a judge who adjudicates any case
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't know everything about everything
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
until it's been explained to them
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that's really the process that we're
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with here we're not specifically
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
talking about breed and illness
 
05:38:35.990 --> 05:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
so so i just wanted to make that clear
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an appeal process
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
05:38:40.080 --> 05:38:41.830 align:start position:0%
and that's it
okay

05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:38:43.990 --> 05:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
and rightfully so it could be denied by
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
the committee all right so it's just a
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
process that the citizens of new
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
i support the bill because i had
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
personal experience dealing with
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
importation of animals from out of state
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
a good friend of mine that i've known
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years he's with me here
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh put in a request for reindeer and by
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
the way colonel
 
05:39:11.110 --> 05:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
oh i love you to death there's only been
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
one known case of cwd and reindeer in
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
the entire country
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
so just i just want to clear that issue
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay so when you say that there's a
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
whole host of cwd cases
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
one okay then that doesn't include of
 
05:39:25.750 --> 05:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
course the number of cwd cases and
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
regular deer elk and moose that are done
 
05:39:29.120 --> 05:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
regular deer elk and moose that are done
nationwide

05:39:30.470 --> 05:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
nationwide
 
05:39:32.070 --> 05:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to clear that up okay that
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
was that was that was stated earlier
 
05:39:34.958 --> 05:39:36.548 align:start position:0%
was that was that was stated earlier
um

05:39:36.548 --> 05:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:38.788 --> 05:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
so as i said my friend rick who i hope
 
05:39:40.470 --> 05:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
you asked to testify next because he's
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
got a wealth of knowledge has been
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
05:39:43.360 --> 05:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
through the process
um

05:39:44.470 --> 05:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
we with no success in dealing with um
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
getting the importation of two reindeer
 
05:39:53.270 --> 05:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay not a herd and
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the import was a
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
multiple fenced-in area drainage and he
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
can provide more information but it
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't like he was just going to let
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
them walk
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
and roam free okay
 
05:40:09.990 --> 05:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
but literally it was
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
and actually to make matters worse too i
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
heard through the grapevine you know
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
because i know people in concord and the
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
political system it said
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much said let it die
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
and that's the wrong thing to say to me
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay and i'm sure a number of you here
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay because you're in the position of
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
serving the citizens of the state of new
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire so letting it die
 
05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
just fell on deaf ears so so what do we
 
05:40:40.000 --> 05:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
just fell on deaf ears so so what do we
have

05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
we have a process in place that
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
a group of fish and game people for
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
have decided that they didn't want to do
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
it because of conditions with another
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
species of
 
05:40:53.520 --> 05:40:55.110 align:start position:0%
species of
prion

05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
prion
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
is that the right word thank you brian
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
and denied somebody else and basically
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
said let it go
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
all right and there is a process in
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
place but it literally comes to an end
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse
 
05:41:09.600 --> 05:41:10.628 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse
okay

05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does it gives
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
someone a recourse to basically say
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
05:41:19.750 --> 05:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
this this is just not the right way to
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
approach the situation because of the
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
science and with that i'll take whatever
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
questions you have but i encourage you
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
to invite mr zillfelder a matter of fact
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
it was a great meeting with you
 
05:41:35.910 --> 05:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
at the meeting but even his own words
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
mr zielfelder knew more about cwd than
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
any of the biologists in the meeting
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
so i welcome you to ask questions of mr
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
zielfelder too
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:49.750 --> 05:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh honorable flanagan for your testimony
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:05.190 --> 05:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
you talked about it going to appeal
 
05:42:07.110 --> 05:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
but the body that it would go to appeal
 
05:42:09.190 --> 05:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the fish and game commission
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't want it
 
05:42:11.040 --> 05:42:12.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't want it
so

05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
that seems to kind of
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
05:42:16.160 --> 05:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
representative

05:42:17.430 --> 05:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:19.830 --> 05:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know many agencies in the state
 
05:42:24.310 --> 05:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
or better yet let me rephrase that that
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.878 --> 05:42:32.788 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up i believe they felt that
 
05:42:37.590 --> 05:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the expertise
 
05:42:39.910 --> 05:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
well i as a and thank you again for the
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
question i'll be more than happy to
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
answer anyone's question is that um
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
if i understand it correctly the way it
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
works in any adjudication process is
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
each side would present their best case
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
argument so mr bergeron may attend or mr
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
mason may attend based on what they know
 
05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
and of course in the case that i'm
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
citing of my friend mr zielfelder is he
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
would present the evidence and then the
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
commission would be the trier of fact
 
05:43:06.310 --> 05:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
being that well he makes more sense than
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
the other person so will either deny it
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
or accept it and if we accept it
 
05:43:12.390 --> 05:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
if we accept it we can conditionalize
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
the exception acceptance on double
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
fencing on veterinarians you know
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
inspections every six months whatever
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
the case may be
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the process in place basically is
 
05:43:26.470 --> 05:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:43:26.480 --> 05:43:28.948 align:start position:0%
you know
we

05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
should be basing it on science and not
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
on conjecture
 
05:43:36.070 --> 05:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered your question
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
05:43:38.000 --> 05:43:39.830 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
i have one with best possible follow-up
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
if you'll entertain me anytime represent
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
are you aware of corbyn reservoir
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
quabbin or corbin
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
no i've never heard of that it's an area
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
designated in the middle of new
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire for hunting it's a private
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
club oh yes yes i've heard of that yeah
 
05:43:59.600 --> 05:44:00.628 align:start position:0%
club oh yes yes i've heard of that yeah
okay

05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:02.470 --> 05:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of species that don't
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
occur naturally here and they've got
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
their high fencing and things and
 
05:44:08.390 --> 05:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
05:44:09.430 --> 05:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
if they were
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
under our system right now with the lack
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
of appeal
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
could they exist no they could not
 
05:44:16.470 --> 05:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's the group where they charge like
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars to be a member
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the club and they bring in animals
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
and they should but it's in a controlled
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
environment and that may have you know
 
05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
certainly but at some point in the past
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
they had to in they had to import their
 
05:44:26.320 --> 05:44:27.350 align:start position:0%
they had to in they had to import their
breeding

05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
breeding
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
correct members and at this point with
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
their lists and denyings
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
well it's interesting i i had lunch with
 
05:44:35.190 --> 05:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
mr zillfather and we were talking about
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
a number of issues and i think there's
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
currently issues on importation of
 
05:44:41.200 --> 05:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
currently issues on importation of
uh

05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
like game that was shot in other states
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
that he might want to share with you
 
05:44:47.430 --> 05:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
some of the information that he's got
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
from he this man went through the ringer
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope i don't take any wind out of
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
your sails rick but he went through the
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
process he went with
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
lieutenant murphy
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is what you got to do and next step
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
next step and then bam
 
05:45:01.200 --> 05:45:02.470 align:start position:0%
next step and then bam
sorry

05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's it we're not letting that happen
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
well you know why would you have all
 
05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
these procedures but
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
some interesting dialogue came out of
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that meeting and i don't want to take
 
05:45:13.830 --> 05:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
away from his fire but i'll take more
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions mr chairman that's all i had
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
for you any other questions from the
 
05:45:17.040 --> 05:45:18.470 align:start position:0%
for you any other questions from the
committee

05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:45:20.310 --> 05:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're excused thank you sir
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see y'all and next is
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
rick zellfelder
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
 
05:45:29.680 --> 05:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
bill

05:45:35.430 --> 05:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.040 --> 05:45:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify that uh
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
cwd without question is a hot topic and
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
i know everybody's ready to stand up and
 
05:46:02.240 --> 05:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
i know everybody's ready to stand up and
fight

05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
fight
 
05:46:06.390 --> 05:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
about their position on cwd and i would
 
05:46:09.030 --> 05:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
love the opportunity to talk
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
about prion disease
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
but we'd be two days on that information
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
and this supposedly is not about cwd
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's about the process here in new
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire correct
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate to ask a couple of
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions before i begin
 
05:46:38.788 --> 05:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
you can if we can answer them we will
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
if you had a son daughter wife husband
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
or loved one that was seriously hurt or
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
died in a medical malpractice incident
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
would it be fair or just that the jury
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
consists of only doctors that worked in
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
the same hospital where the incident
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
well consider that as not needing an
 
05:47:03.430 --> 05:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
answer but continue on you got my point
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
would new hampshire would new hampshire
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislators shut down a new hampshire
 
05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
turnpike without doing a traffic study
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
again i'll take that as a rhetorical
 
05:47:14.708 --> 05:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
question for the committee to consider
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
my first call to new hampshire fishing
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
game about reindeer
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
in december of 2018 i was referred to
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
heidi murphy
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
when inquiring about importing reindeer
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
i was told all about fencing
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in the state of new
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire that i would need a usda
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
exhibitor's license that i should speak
 
05:47:41.110 --> 05:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
with cindy heisler at the department of
 
05:47:41.120 --> 05:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
with cindy heisler at the department of
agriculture

05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
would need to be familiar with agr 2100
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
paying specific attention to 2116.01
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
and 0.02 we also spoke about charlie
 
05:47:52.160 --> 05:47:54.948 align:start position:0%
and 0.02 we also spoke about charlie
hutchinson

05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
i left that call feeling like she was a
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
very nice lady but i had some serious
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
if she had only said this is not
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
possible currently because of the
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
state's cwd concerns we would not be
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
dana merrill the road to nowhere
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
i assumed that i would be the only
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
reindeer owners and breeders association
 
05:48:27.990 --> 05:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
member in new hampshire other than
 
05:48:30.548 --> 05:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
nicholas staley of santa's village
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
in scanning the roba membership i
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
stumbled across dana merrill from
 
05:48:34.320 --> 05:48:35.590 align:start position:0%
stumbled across dana merrill from
deerfield

05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
deerfield
 
05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
i called him to ask if he did in fact
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
have reindeer he explained he was
 
05:48:42.150 --> 05:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking into importing reindeer from
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
that point i was copied on emails as he
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
was given the same routine that i had
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
been through
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
from these emails i see statements from
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
state officials about how and why
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
service importation will not happen
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
why was i not told about this and my
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
calls with the department of agriculture
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
and fishing game
 
05:49:02.958 --> 05:49:04.868 align:start position:0%
and fishing game
confusion

05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
in preparing to apply for permits i
 
05:49:09.590 --> 05:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
started studying as much as possible
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
about cwd
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
and then prion disease in an expanded
 
05:49:13.360 --> 05:49:15.990 align:start position:0%
and then prion disease in an expanded
view

05:49:15.990 --> 05:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
i quickly learned the state's
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire's deer program is
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
full of what appears to be double
 
05:49:23.910 --> 05:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
standards when it comes to cwd
 
05:49:23.920 --> 05:49:25.110 align:start position:0%
standards when it comes to cwd
management

05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
management
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
at first i didn't i didn't know
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
how someone can be this naive but over
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
time it has become clear that hunting
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
and or revenue is more important than
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.070 --> 05:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
why aren't there more eyes on what's
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually going on versus the nice and
 
05:49:49.510 --> 05:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.520 --> 05:49:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
at this point i could give you example
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
after example after example and we could
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
spend hours debating what's right and
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
wrong on prion disease but it's not the
 
05:50:02.480 --> 05:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
wrong on prion disease but it's not the
place

05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture meeting in the
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
summer of 2020 the honorable mr flanagan
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
organized a meeting with mr jasper mr
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
crawford mr flynn again and myself we

discussed the importation of reindeer a
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
short time
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
a short time after
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
that meeting
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
it was suggested that i create the
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
importation permits as they did not
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
why did heidi murphy give me a to-do
 
05:50:52.470 --> 05:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
list when there is no way past the gate
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
why did mr crawford not bring up the
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
built-in loopholes regarding usda
 
05:51:00.150 --> 05:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
cwd herd certification
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
especially when he has such a strong
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
view about the program not working again
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
this comes from the emails that i was
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
copied on but they're all things that
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
were kind of hidden and never discussed
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
usda does have opinion about a bunch of
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
those comments as well
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
their responses make a tremendous amount
 
05:51:27.910 --> 05:51:27.920 align:start position:0%

on november 2nd 2020 my final my family
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
finds a dead deer below our barn it's
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
covered in grass with no risk no visible
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
reason for its death
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
i call ron arsenault and tell him about
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
our finding he states it's probably a
 
05:51:54.788 --> 05:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
bobcat kill
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
because of my concern with cwd i asked
 
05:51:59.430 --> 05:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
if we could have it tested
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
he stated we don't do that in the state
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
i told him his response shocked me
 
05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
especially since i was scheduled to meet
 
05:52:09.190 --> 05:52:09.200 align:start position:0%

05:52:11.350 --> 05:52:11.360 align:start position:0%

after reviewing game cameras ron
 
05:52:23.350 --> 05:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
arsenault was 100 right it was a bobcat
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%

in my opinion mr mason's mind was made
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
up prior to the meeting
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
he was disengaged and looking out the
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
windows it appears we were there as a
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
gesture gesture of professional courtesy
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
to mr jasper
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
i brought up my call with ron arsenault
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
and dan bergeron ran him over with the

05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
he is an enforcement and has no idea

what he is talking about
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
i tried to initiate a debate was shut

new hampshire's cwd management approach
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
it was clear mr mason was standing by

called the lab twice and told they were

let's go back to ron arsenault his
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and doesn't know what he is
 
05:54:57.830 --> 05:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
in early november of 2021 a new
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident called and spoke with
 
05:55:05.910 --> 05:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
dan bergeron on strange deer activity on
 
05:55:08.310 --> 05:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
his 27-acre property
 
05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
this made him really nervous about the
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
deer he just targeted harvested
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
being cautious he asked if he could have
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the deer tested for cwd
 
05:55:19.830 --> 05:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
dan reassured him that deer activity was
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
nothing to be concerned with and no they

05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
in my seat seems like ron arsenault was
 
05:55:32.310 --> 05:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
a straight shooter and his statement was
 
05:55:32.320 --> 05:55:36.548 align:start position:0%
a straight shooter and his statement was
accurate

05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
dan talked about
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
using science and that's that's actually
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
a very good comment
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
and it's true
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you to think about dna
 
05:58:07.920 --> 05:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you to think about dna
testing

05:58:09.030 --> 05:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
testing
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
and in the 80s when dna testing came
 
05:58:11.680 --> 05:58:12.470 align:start position:0%
and in the 80s when dna testing came
around

05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
you needed a lot of material to test and
 
05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
you were very very limited on what test
 
05:58:20.470 --> 05:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
05:58:20.480 --> 05:58:21.910 align:start position:0%
could be done
today

05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:58:24.470 --> 05:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
you can take an extremely amount
 
05:58:24.480 --> 05:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
you can take an extremely amount
of

05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
extremely small amount of dna
 
05:58:31.350 --> 05:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
continue to build it and process it
 
05:58:33.990 --> 05:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then perform an array of different
 
05:58:35.830 --> 05:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
tests on
 
05:58:38.830 --> 05:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
dna material
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
cwd science is very very similar
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh what we know
 
05:58:45.600 --> 05:58:46.708 align:start position:0%
uh what we know
today

05:58:46.708 --> 05:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
versus what went on in 2015 and 16 are
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
worlds apart
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:57.750 --> 05:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
05:58:57.760 --> 05:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
members

05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:59:02.390 --> 05:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none you're excused and thank you
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.670 --> 05:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
before i take back overs anybody else
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on house bill
 
05:59:14.878 --> 05:59:15.750 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on house bill
sorry

05:59:15.750 --> 05:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh 12.99
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing any i'm going to hold this
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i had a question
 
05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
for you willing to answer it yes if he's
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
how you doing good i believe you've left
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
your laptop on the uh
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
question i have in my mind on the bill
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's being
 
05:59:54.000 --> 05:59:57.270 align:start position:0%
that's being
presented

05:59:57.270 --> 05:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
under section one
 
06:00:02.830 --> 06:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
it says upon petition and within 45 days
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the executive directed to deny a
 
06:00:08.548 --> 06:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
permit requested under rsa 207 and a
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
pawn a majority vote of a quorum of
 
06:00:11.360 --> 06:00:12.788 align:start position:0%
pawn a majority vote of a quorum of
commissioners

06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
may reverse such decision
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
by written ruling issue within 14 days
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the hearing
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
at the current time
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
can the fish and game commission
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
overrule anything that you
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
not just you know not just these
 
06:00:31.510 --> 06:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
wildlife permits but as a general rule
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
can the fish and game overrule you
 
06:00:36.868 --> 06:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
um careful because they didn't want to
 
06:00:40.230 --> 06:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:43.830 --> 06:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
when you read through i apologize first
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
of all my name is scott mace i'm the
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
executive director of new hampshire fish
 
06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
and game
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
um when you read through fish and game
 
06:00:52.080 --> 06:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
um when you read through fish and game
law

06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
grandma's patchwork quilt
 
06:00:57.990 --> 06:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
and and there are certain authorities
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the commission has and certain
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
authorities that the director has
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes i need to tell them what i'm
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
doing sometimes i need to ask permission
 
06:01:08.230 --> 06:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
before i do it
 
06:01:10.150 --> 06:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes there's something
 
06:01:13.270 --> 06:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between that we have to do
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
um but it all depends on what the issue
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
is and it depends on the
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah i just asked a question
 
06:01:32.230 --> 06:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.470 --> 06:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
this year's red yeah
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
so every year the fish and game laws
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
change and i would just answer the
 
06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
question because i didn't know if they
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
if this was granting them some new
 
06:01:44.548 --> 06:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
authority that they didn't already have
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
normally any of the appeal processes
 
06:01:54.548 --> 06:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
that take place um
 
06:01:56.230 --> 06:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know like we just went through a
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
whole new rule-making process on aot
 
06:01:59.120 --> 06:01:59.990 align:start position:0%
whole new rule-making process on aot
um

06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:02.470 --> 06:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's you know my biologists are making
 
06:02:05.670 --> 06:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
the initial decision on aot i'm not and
 
06:02:08.070 --> 06:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
then they then there's an appeal process
 
06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
that brings you know if somebody wants
 
06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
to appeal the decision of the biologist
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
they then bring that to me as the appeal
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearing officer it's the same thing on
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
license suspensions
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
um what takes place there is you know a
 
06:02:20.000 --> 06:02:22.150 align:start position:0%
um what takes place there is you know a
ceo

06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
ceo
 
06:02:24.390 --> 06:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
gives out a citation and an honor or a
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
fisherman loses their license that
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
person can appeal that decision to me so
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not part of i'm not usually part of
 
06:02:33.270 --> 06:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
the initial decisions on these items and
 
06:02:33.280 --> 06:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
the initial decisions on these items and
then

06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
then i end up being the appeal officer
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
for fish and game is the way most of our
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:44.470 --> 06:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative jack thank you can i
 
06:02:46.470 --> 06:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
raise one thing uh the department
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
brought up uh it's on line 13 of the
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
original bill and line eight of the
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the loss
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the any other conditions language and
 
06:02:55.030 --> 06:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
the colonel
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
gave the example of
 
06:02:59.350 --> 06:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
it would be fine to import this animal
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we get a medical clearance and
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
the question be if the sponsor intended
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
to lose that
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
they would then have to deny the permit
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the ability to
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
ask for it and it may be something you
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to consider before you
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
before you execute the bill whether you
 
06:03:16.708 --> 06:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
want it whether you would want to repair
 
06:03:19.990 --> 06:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
that in any way
 
06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we'll just hold this bill
 
06:03:27.910 --> 06:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
until the 25th and there i know we had
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
some conversation around the 30th time
 
06:03:31.190 --> 06:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
the 30-day timeline maybe we have an
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
amendment there that would maybe make it
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
more reasonable for people so i'll take
 
06:03:38.390 --> 06:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
that advisement and and consider it
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
and if you have an extra copy of
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
something that the committee needs to
 
06:03:41.280 --> 06:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
something that the committee needs to
see

06:03:42.070 --> 06:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:03:44.310 --> 06:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
we can get copies made
 
06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
i see you holding it up
 
06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
would probably be of interest to the
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
committee and we'd welcome it
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've got our we've got our person
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:04:08.470 --> 06:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
people wishing to testify
 
06:04:08.480 --> 06:04:09.350 align:start position:0%
people wishing to testify
or

06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:04:09.360 --> 06:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
or
questions

06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
there being no further testimony we're

06:05:53.040 --> 06:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
hello

06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
sorry for being outside i figured you
 
06:06:01.110 --> 06:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
guys had a really long day ahead of you
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i was just getting comfortable
 
06:06:03.440 --> 06:06:04.548 align:start position:0%
and i was just getting comfortable
um

06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:06.470 --> 06:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
my name is amanda bolden i represent
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district 12.
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:06:12.470 --> 06:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
here to discuss with you
 
06:06:14.548 --> 06:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
the baby squirrel bill
 
06:06:14.558 --> 06:06:16.310 align:start position:0%
the baby squirrel bill
um

06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
so i don't serve on this committee and
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
i've never testified here before not
 
06:06:22.788 --> 06:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
that i recall anyway i can imagine the
 
06:06:24.548 --> 06:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
kind of testimony that you typically
 
06:06:24.558 --> 06:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
kind of testimony that you typically
hear

06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
hear
 
06:06:28.708 --> 06:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to present to you something
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
so if you'll oblige uh a little i have a
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
little short story for you and i'd like
 
06:06:41.430 --> 06:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
to know what you think
 
06:06:43.990 --> 06:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
so in 1988 the legislature
 
06:06:45.510 --> 06:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
ceded control
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
over hunting season dates to the fish
 
06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
and game commission
 
06:06:50.310 --> 06:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
the argument that was made at the time
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
was that the commission would be better
 
06:06:54.390 --> 06:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
able to adapt to changes in population
 
06:06:55.750 --> 06:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
that makes sense we do things really
 
06:06:58.708 --> 06:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
slowly in this building
 
06:07:00.390 --> 06:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
when the grey squirrel season was set by
 
06:07:03.750 --> 06:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature prior to when control
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
was seated to the commission
 
06:07:08.230 --> 06:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
the season began on october 1st
 
06:07:09.830 --> 06:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
and as you know
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
as i assume you know given the committee
 
06:07:13.430 --> 06:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
that you serve on
 
06:07:15.990 --> 06:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the fish and game commission currently
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
sets the season to begin on september
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
1st so a full month earlier
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
when the fish and game commission was
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
given authority to set the dates back in
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
1988 1989 it maintained the same
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
starting date of october 1st until 2004.
 
06:07:32.230 --> 06:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
when um and it was in 2004 when a
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposal came forward to change the
 
06:07:35.670 --> 06:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
starting date to be the last saturday in
 
06:07:35.680 --> 06:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
starting date to be the last saturday in
september

06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
september
 
06:07:37.600 --> 06:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
september
um

06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
i feel like maybe this is the most
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
boring topic in the world but
 
06:07:44.070 --> 06:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know what other bills you've
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
06:07:46.400 --> 06:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
heard today
so

06:07:47.830 --> 06:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:50.548 --> 06:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
so i've provided packets to you that
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
showed documentation of conversations in
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
the commission where there was a
 
06:07:56.470 --> 06:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
proposal to change the date for the
 
06:07:59.190 --> 06:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
grey squirrel the cotton caliber rabbit
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the snowshoe here to the last
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
saturday in september which is just a
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
few days prior to the october first date
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
that was originally set by the
 
06:08:09.270 --> 06:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
commission so it seemed like they were
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
only in 2004 they were only trying to
 
06:08:13.350 --> 06:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
change it by a few days
 
06:08:13.360 --> 06:08:14.868 align:start position:0%
change it by a few days
um

06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
when the new rule was formally adopted
 
06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
the only the snowshoe hair and the
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
cottontail rabbit were given a starting
 
06:08:22.868 --> 06:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
date of the last saturday in september
 
06:08:24.788 --> 06:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
and strangely the gray squirrel was
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
inexplicably given the starting date of
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
september 1st
 
06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
interestingly when i put in a research
 
06:08:32.070 --> 06:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
request here at the state house to find
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
out more the research department wasn't
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
able to find anything
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's no paper trail showing that any
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
motion was actually made to change the
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
date for the great squirrel to september
 
06:08:41.280 --> 06:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
date for the great squirrel to september
1st

06:08:42.470 --> 06:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
1st
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
it genuinely seems like this might be a
 
06:08:44.878 --> 06:08:46.788 align:start position:0%
it genuinely seems like this might be a
typo

06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
typo
 
06:08:48.230 --> 06:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
in fact the state house researcher
 
06:08:49.510 --> 06:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
06:08:51.350 --> 06:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
mike morrell at the administrative rules
 
06:08:52.788 --> 06:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
division and learned that these kinds of
 
06:08:54.788 --> 06:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
typos have happened before
 
06:08:56.470 --> 06:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
and that he believes that the date is
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
set at september 1st maybe by accident
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
it could just be a
 
06:09:00.240 --> 06:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
it could just be a
um

06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:01.200 --> 06:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:09:03.910 --> 06:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.270 --> 06:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
all of this is in the packets that i
 
06:09:06.548 --> 06:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
gave to you they're really short also
 
06:09:08.788 --> 06:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
the first page the packet is some data
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
from someone that i think is not
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
testifying today in case you're
 
06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
interested in what the wildlife
 
06:09:16.230 --> 06:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i know that you're going to hear and
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm very sorry
 
06:09:21.910 --> 06:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
that if a lot of time is spent today
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
hearing opinions that i know that you've
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
heard before opinions for and against
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
hunting opinions about
 
06:09:29.190 --> 06:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know the right to hunt
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
or the rights of animals and that's not
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about
 
06:09:33.920 --> 06:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about
um

06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
i genuinely believe that there's just
 
06:09:38.470 --> 06:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
been a clerical error
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
if you can find
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
like i said this is a mystery if you can
 
06:09:41.840 --> 06:09:42.868 align:start position:0%
like i said this is a mystery if you can
find

06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
find
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
documentation explaining why the date
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
was set at september 1st after the
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
entire discussion
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
revolved around
 
06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
the last saturday in september i'd love
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
to see it our researchers couldn't find
 
06:09:54.240 --> 06:09:54.948 align:start position:0%
to see it our researchers couldn't find
it

06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:09:54.958 --> 06:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
it
um

06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:57.430 --> 06:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the intent on the part
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the commission originally in 2004 was
 
06:10:01.350 --> 06:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
always to keep it pretty close to
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
october 1st
 
06:10:03.200 --> 06:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
october 1st
and

06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:05.430 --> 06:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty obvious the intent
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
of a hunting season is to preserve a
 
06:10:10.240 --> 06:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
of a hunting season is to preserve a
population

06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
and if your limit is five squirrels a
 
06:10:16.150 --> 06:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
day but some of those squirrels have
 
06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
young comes back to the nest
 
06:10:21.190 --> 06:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
you're back
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
more than five a day effectively and
 
06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's a problem because the purpose of
 
06:10:27.750 --> 06:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
a hunting season and limits on hunting
 
06:10:29.830 --> 06:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that the population remains
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
for future hunting
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it's that sort of potential
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
mismanagement that works against
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
goal of a hunting season and limits on
 
06:10:39.920 --> 06:10:42.548 align:start position:0%
goal of a hunting season and limits on
hunting

06:10:42.548 --> 06:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:45.430 --> 06:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
i feel that this date of september 15th
 
06:10:47.990 --> 06:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable compromise i think that
 
06:10:50.470 --> 06:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
it preserves the need of the fish and
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
game commission to have
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
the ability like that open-ended ability
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
to set dates in accordance with
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
population changes i hope that it
 
06:11:00.548 --> 06:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between what the two
 
06:11:03.910 --> 06:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
teams in this room kind of are wanting
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i also want to mention
 
06:11:07.110 --> 06:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
06:11:09.270 --> 06:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
underscore the possibility that the
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
september first date is just a clear
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
clerical error
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
in maine the season begins september
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
25th which is pretty close to the last
 
06:11:19.990 --> 06:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
saturday in september in massachusetts
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
the day floats a little based on
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
holidays but in one zone in the state it
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
begins september 13th and another zone
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
it begins october 15th so it's a lot
 
06:11:30.948 --> 06:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
later and in rhode island it begins
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
october 16th so i think that generally
 
06:11:35.430 --> 06:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's always been an intent for the
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of the squirrel gray scroll
 
06:11:39.190 --> 06:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
season to be around
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the first of october and i think that
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the documentation
 
06:11:45.750 --> 06:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it appears
 
06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
that september 1st is just a mistake
 
06:11:48.480 --> 06:11:49.270 align:start position:0%
that september 1st is just a mistake
and

06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of this bill
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll start any community
 
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
members have any questions
 
06:11:59.670 --> 06:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
i just have one were you aware you could
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
file uh official requests or open
 
06:12:03.990 --> 06:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking as a state legislator to the
 
06:12:05.590 --> 06:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
department and especially citing the
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
administrative rule uh to have them
 
06:12:09.910 --> 06:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
reopen rulemaking if they felt it was
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate and did you follow that
 
06:12:11.520 --> 06:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate and did you follow that
process

06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:12:14.948 --> 06:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my understanding that
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
after the petition that was made in 2019
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
to change um the opening of the season
 
06:12:22.708 --> 06:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
failed that that's where that
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
conversation ends and that this is the
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
next step
 
06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions from community
 
06:12:29.440 --> 06:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
any other questions from community
members

06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bolden
 
06:12:33.990 --> 06:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
06:12:36.310 --> 06:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
next up is representative howard pearl
 
06:12:38.948 --> 06:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to the bill
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
and just for community members i'm going
 
06:12:41.830 --> 06:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
to forward representative pearl sent
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
some photos in but we only have one copy
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm just sitting around so you can
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
look at it and he can explain what they
 
06:12:45.920 --> 06:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
look at it and he can explain what they
are

06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i thank you
 
06:12:50.788 --> 06:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
members of the fish and game committee
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
howard pearl from loudoun i represent
 
06:12:56.628 --> 06:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
merrimack 26.
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
so uh as the chairman has stated i sent
 
06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
around some pictures that you'll see
 
06:13:03.670 --> 06:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
the kind of damage that gray squirrels
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
do to the infrastructure that i work
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
with in the maple industry
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's some pieces of
 
06:13:12.390 --> 06:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
tubing the plastic tubing that we use
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
very very much destroyed
 
06:13:15.920 --> 06:13:16.948 align:start position:0%
very very much destroyed
and

06:13:16.948 --> 06:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:18.868 --> 06:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
in the i also sent a picture of one of
 
06:13:18.878 --> 06:13:20.070 align:start position:0%
in the i also sent a picture of one of
my

06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
buildings that houses some of my maple
 
06:13:24.310 --> 06:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
equipment that they we have to keep warm
 
06:13:26.150 --> 06:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
the squirrels got into the building and
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
just destroyed it so
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
i am here um opposing shortening the
 
06:13:32.548 --> 06:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
season in fact i'd very much recommend
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee that you lengthen the
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
season or completely abolish it just
 
06:13:38.070 --> 06:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
like we have with any of the other
 
06:13:40.628 --> 06:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
rodents in the red squirrels or
 
06:13:43.110 --> 06:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
chipmunks or any of the others they do a
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of damage that we deal
 
06:13:46.948 --> 06:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
with in the agricultural industry on a
 
06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
very regular basis
 
06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
grey squirrels probably cost my business
 
06:13:53.590 --> 06:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
well in excess of ten to twenty thousand
 
06:13:55.590 --> 06:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in the damage that they
 
06:13:57.430 --> 06:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
do in the in the woods in the in the
 
06:13:59.110 --> 06:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
lines that we use for the maple
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
collection and again in my buildings
 
06:14:02.868 --> 06:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
i recognize that uh
 
06:14:07.270 --> 06:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
many people think that gray squirrels
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
are pretty and they're cute and they're
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
fun to look at
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
in that they probably all are but i can
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
tell you if you've spent the thousands
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
of hours in repairing the damage that
 
06:14:18.390 --> 06:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
they do and i wish i was exaggerating
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
just on my own farm i spend literally
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
repairing what they destroy and i can
 
06:14:27.030 --> 06:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
tell you that all throughout the state
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
we have a vast collection of maple
 
06:14:32.070 --> 06:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
producers who would very much back the
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
feeling that these are
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
these animals do a lot of damage so i
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee certainly
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
not to shorten the season and if you
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
really want to do something that would
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
benefit agriculture you'd consider
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
abolishing the season and let them
 
06:14:46.230 --> 06:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
letting us deal with them in the manner
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to to
 
06:14:50.150 --> 06:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
sort of protect the
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the business that we
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
have in place
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
they do a tremendous amount of damage in
 
06:14:57.590 --> 06:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
the fields in my crops too in the squash
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
and especially winter squash because
 
06:15:01.270 --> 06:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
they're chasing the seeds as we approach
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
winter so we have a lot of damage
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
between them and the field nice as
 
06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're chewing the product and making
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
it unsalable for us
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
i won't take any more of your time i
 
06:15:11.190 --> 06:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
know you've got a ton of people that
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to testify and you've got a lot on
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
your next bill but i'll certainly
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
06:15:21.910 --> 06:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:15:23.830 --> 06:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearl
 
06:15:23.840 --> 06:15:24.788 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearl
um

06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
quick question sure based on your
 
06:15:28.150 --> 06:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
testimony i just had a question for
 
06:15:28.160 --> 06:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
testimony i just had a question for
myself

06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's a hunting season do you know of
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
anybody who hunts grey squirrels or did
 
06:15:34.948 --> 06:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
they just kill them because they're
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
eating pipes
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
so there are a few people that do hunt
 
06:15:39.990 --> 06:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a great question and thank you
 
06:15:41.910 --> 06:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
for it there are a few people that will
 
06:15:44.310 --> 06:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
hunt and we certainly encourage
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
anyone that's interested in wanting to
 
06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
to you know come out and take care of
 
06:15:50.788 --> 06:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
you know wanting to do that hunting but
 
06:15:52.548 --> 06:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
these animals are very prolific and we
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate what we can of them reasonably
 
06:15:59.670 --> 06:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
to try and protect our infrastructure
 
06:16:02.310 --> 06:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
but we fall behind every year i mean the
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
again i can't
 
06:16:06.788 --> 06:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you the vast amount of
 
06:16:08.548 --> 06:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
damage that that they do on these
 
06:16:08.558 --> 06:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
damage that that they do on these
systems

06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
systems
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
they may chew every six inches on a
 
06:16:13.670 --> 06:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
piece of pipe at times and i have more
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
than 450 000 feet of pipe on my farm
 
06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they just they will literally chew
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
10 000 20 000 holes in it in the season
 
06:16:25.510 --> 06:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's amazing
 
06:16:27.510 --> 06:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
and frustrating all the same but thank
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
06:16:35.590 --> 06:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:37.350 --> 06:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:16:39.590 --> 06:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware that
 
06:16:42.788 --> 06:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
the hunting seasons do not impact a
 
06:16:45.910 --> 06:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
landowner or farmer's ability to do pest
 
06:16:45.920 --> 06:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
landowner or farmer's ability to do pest
management

06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
management
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
for the very reasons that you've already
 
06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
laid out
 
06:16:51.350 --> 06:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for the question i
 
06:16:52.868 --> 06:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
am aware of that but the problem is
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's one of me and i'm only allowed
 
06:16:57.350 --> 06:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do a certain amount if i want to have
 
06:16:58.948 --> 06:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
other folks help me then they have to
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
abide by the hunting rules in order to
 
06:17:04.868 --> 06:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative kanye for a
 
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
06:17:14.548 --> 06:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
representative howard for taking my
 
06:17:14.558 --> 06:17:15.670 align:start position:0%
representative howard for taking my
question

06:17:15.670 --> 06:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:17:15.680 --> 06:17:16.708 align:start position:0%
question
uh

06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
let me give you a little bit background
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
then i'll post that question you know
 
06:17:22.788 --> 06:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
while i was preparing for this testimony
 
06:17:24.470 --> 06:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh my wife
 
06:17:26.470 --> 06:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
asked me to tell everybody that we have
 
06:17:28.150 --> 06:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
to pear tree
 
06:17:30.868 --> 06:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
and i i am a big follower of leave and
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
let leave but we have two pear tree we
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
cannot have one pair in here you know
 
06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
everything is gone at the end of the
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
season the main reason is
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's a solar panels we have in three
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
houses in our neighborhood they all live
 
06:17:46.230 --> 06:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
under the solar panel if they live in
 
06:17:48.310 --> 06:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
the trees and other places is no problem
 
06:17:50.470 --> 06:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
but they have a really big concentration
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
of those things so do you believe that
 
06:17:55.510 --> 06:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
while we are doing this those
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know solar panel has to be you know
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
changed so we we can live peacefully and
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
they can live peacefully in their
 
06:18:02.240 --> 06:18:03.990 align:start position:0%
they can live peacefully in their
habitat

06:18:03.990 --> 06:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
habitat
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i honestly
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
don't know a lot about
 
06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know their habitats uh in in that
 
06:18:09.440 --> 06:18:10.708 align:start position:0%
you know their habitats uh in in that
particular

06:18:10.708 --> 06:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:18:12.868 --> 06:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
instance but i can tell you that they
 
06:18:15.270 --> 06:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
habitate in my buildings especially and
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
they do an
 
06:18:18.070 --> 06:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
awful lot of damage
 
06:18:18.080 --> 06:18:19.350 align:start position:0%
awful lot of damage
to

06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
many of the outbuildings that i have
 
06:18:24.070 --> 06:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll stick to speaking just to what i
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
know about but thank you for the
 
06:18:25.200 --> 06:18:26.788 align:start position:0%
know about but thank you for the
question

06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:18:28.310 --> 06:18:28.320 align:start position:0%

06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
people are representing so next up is
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:00.470 --> 06:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh can you hear me okay
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
let's put the mic a little closer so you
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
can hear
 
06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:19:07.110 --> 06:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes my name is christina snyder and i
 
06:19:09.990 --> 06:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
i originally um i did
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
send in electronic testimony i did
 
06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
verify from one rep that it was received
 
06:19:16.548 --> 06:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
but i do have copies here if you'd like
 
06:19:18.150 --> 06:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
to see that as well
 
06:19:21.190 --> 06:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
i i was the member of the public that
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
petitioned fish and game department in
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
2019 to
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
push back the start date of the great
 
06:19:30.868 --> 06:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
eastern gray squirrel season
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
from september 1st to september 15th
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
and i came about that petition after
 
06:19:40.628 --> 06:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
looking at other states in new england
 
06:19:42.628 --> 06:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
and when their dates were
 
06:19:45.510 --> 06:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
and three are later and then
 
06:19:48.628 --> 06:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
i also was seeing several posts about
 
06:19:50.470 --> 06:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
orphan baby gray squirrels that were
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
being brought in to wildlife
 
06:19:51.840 --> 06:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
being brought in to wildlife
rehabilitators

06:19:53.830 --> 06:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
which led me to believe that if the
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
mother squirrel is being hunted then
 
06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
there are the orphaned babies left in
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
the nest
 
06:20:02.708 --> 06:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
so i was seeing and i got in touch with
 
06:20:05.110 --> 06:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
several wildlife rehabilitators
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they they confirmed that and that
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
was in my testimony that i sent in and i
 
06:20:14.070 --> 06:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
also saw that there was a post
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me let me go back um so with the
 
06:20:16.558 --> 06:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
excuse me let me go back um so with the
petition

06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
petition
 
06:20:19.750 --> 06:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
i went through the process
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
and then when the biologists decided to
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
go against the petition they cited
 
06:20:26.948 --> 06:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
studies from 1994 and 1977 from
 
06:20:29.350 --> 06:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in new york and by the way
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts actually has a later start
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
date for the gray squirrel they have
 
06:20:38.310 --> 06:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
two zones in zones one through nine it
 
06:20:39.990 --> 06:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
starts 9 12
 
06:20:41.670 --> 06:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
zones 10 through 14 it starts
 
06:20:43.590 --> 06:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
mid-october so
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
one of the states they use the studies
 
06:20:47.030 --> 06:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
from is actually has a later
 
06:20:48.548 --> 06:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
season start
 
06:20:48.558 --> 06:20:49.670 align:start position:0%
season start
and

06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
what happened with with the process was
 
06:20:55.590 --> 06:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
that in in my view and in other views
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
that observe the process and i will say
 
06:20:59.990 --> 06:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
that i know that there are a couple of
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
commissioners here today but they were
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
not on the commission when this petition
 
06:21:04.798 --> 06:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
not on the commission when this petition
happened

06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:21:06.240 --> 06:21:07.110 align:start position:0%
happened
so

06:21:07.110 --> 06:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:09.430 --> 06:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
06:21:09.440 --> 06:21:10.150 align:start position:0%
what happened was
the

06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:13.350 --> 06:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
the biologists went against the petition
 
06:21:15.270 --> 06:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
however it came about that the
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
commission itself never received all of
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was in support of the
 
06:21:21.670 --> 06:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
petition which was from the wildlife
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators and a couple of the
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners said i don't want to vote
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to table until we see that
 
06:21:27.520 --> 06:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
i'd like to table until we see that
information

06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:21:30.948 --> 06:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
the chair of the commission at the time
 
06:21:33.350 --> 06:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
said nope we're going to deny this let's
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
vote now and he made a motion to deny
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
the petition or say no
 
06:21:41.190 --> 06:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that was the prevailing vote so i
 
06:21:43.030 --> 06:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
actually had legal counsel come up to me
 
06:21:45.430 --> 06:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
and apologize and say that was my bad
 
06:21:46.708 --> 06:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:21:46.718 --> 06:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
and and
the

06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
chief biologist at the time said as well
 
06:21:52.708 --> 06:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
that he was sorry it was his mistake so
 
06:21:55.190 --> 06:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
the the commission never even saw all of
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
the information
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
so that's why this kind of came into
 
06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
legislation because and then by in the
 
06:22:02.708 --> 06:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
rulings and in the hearings i kept
 
06:22:04.230 --> 06:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
bringing up this information and it was
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
just disregarded
 
06:22:06.000 --> 06:22:07.110 align:start position:0%
just disregarded
so

06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:22:10.788 --> 06:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
it's very clear because even fish and
 
06:22:13.830 --> 06:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
game in 2011 put a post out on facebook
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
saying that they were receiving many
 
06:22:16.638 --> 06:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
saying that they were receiving many
calls

06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
calls
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
that there were high winds and baby
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
squirrels were falling out a nest in the
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
trees and that was on august 29th and
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
they said they didn't say baby squirrels
 
06:22:26.788 --> 06:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
they were seeing them they said they
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
were falling out of the nest on the
 
06:22:29.110 --> 06:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
trees they were helpless and they
 
06:22:31.590 --> 06:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
referred them to wildlife rehabilitators
 
06:22:33.830 --> 06:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
well it also came to my attention
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
that wildlife rehabilitator testimony
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
and and data and stats on the grey
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
squirrels was never even looked at or
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
considered when they made this decision
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
to go against a petition or when the
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
squirrel season should start or not
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
start given the reproduction rate of
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the grey squirrels
 
06:22:52.320 --> 06:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
of the grey squirrels
so

06:22:53.590 --> 06:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
they did they did refer to nuisance
 
06:22:58.628 --> 06:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
trappers and i i did hear uh
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
what was just testimony before me about
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
the nuisance and however nuisance
 
06:23:03.280 --> 06:23:04.470 align:start position:0%
the nuisance and however nuisance
trapping

06:23:04.470 --> 06:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
trapping
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
and nuisance permits are allowed all
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
year round
 
06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i you know i i would think that if
 
06:23:13.030 --> 06:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
the department was getting so many
 
06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
nuisance calls about squirrels
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
then they might relent on the predators
 
06:23:20.310 --> 06:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit and they might put a cap on
 
06:23:21.670 --> 06:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
the foxes
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that the foxes could hunt the grey
 
06:23:25.670 --> 06:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
squirrels but unfortunately they allow
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
an unlimited take on the fox and i know
 
06:23:30.948 --> 06:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
that uh it's good to know a little bit
 
06:23:32.470 --> 06:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
that there might be this nuisance
 
06:23:34.150 --> 06:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
because then at least we know that the
 
06:23:37.350 --> 06:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
bobcat if that comes up again can help
 
06:23:39.270 --> 06:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
take care of the squirrels and we won't
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
need a season on the bobcat
 
06:23:41.600 --> 06:23:42.548 align:start position:0%
need a season on the bobcat
so

06:23:42.548 --> 06:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:45.030 --> 06:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
nuisance there is nature predators can
 
06:23:46.868 --> 06:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
take care of the nuisance this just has
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
to do with the baby squirrels it has to
 
06:23:51.030 --> 06:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
do with them being orphaned
 
06:23:52.948 --> 06:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
and if the hunter kills
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the mother squirrel the babies will die
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
and if the season was extended on the
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
tail end it was extended from december
 
06:24:02.548 --> 06:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
31st to january 31st so it still would
 
06:24:05.190 --> 06:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
even be two weeks more and if you have a
 
06:24:07.910 --> 06:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
five-take limit and there's 130 days of
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
the season that still allows every
 
06:24:12.390 --> 06:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
squirrel hunter 690 squirrels that they
 
06:24:13.590 --> 06:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
can kill
 
06:24:15.430 --> 06:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
and if you wanted to you know if there
 
06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
was such an issue with the nuisance why
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
does fishing game why isn't it
 
06:24:22.230 --> 06:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
petitioned to take off the limit of five
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
and put unlimited
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's really it's the timing factor
 
06:24:28.310 --> 06:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's important because they do
 
06:24:31.350 --> 06:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
consider reproduction and when animals
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
are dependent on their their mothers for
 
06:24:36.070 --> 06:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
other seasons or other animals that they
 
06:24:38.150 --> 06:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
they dictate seasons for so why is the
 
06:24:40.708 --> 06:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
squirrel any different they even say so
 
06:24:42.868 --> 06:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
themselves that there are dependent
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
squirrels this time of year
 
06:24:46.948 --> 06:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
it's just two weeks
 
06:24:49.350 --> 06:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a big question it's it's it's a
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
very good compromise
 
06:24:53.830 --> 06:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it just seems that it's not a lot to
 
06:24:55.670 --> 06:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
ask and the evidence is all there and
 
06:24:57.670 --> 06:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
the wildlife rehabilitators that they
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
refer these animals to they're not
 
06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
referring trappers they're referring
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
these orphans to the wildlife real
 
06:25:06.230 --> 06:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators they're not seeking their
 
06:25:07.510 --> 06:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
input they're not seeking their
 
06:25:09.350 --> 06:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and the wildlife
 
06:25:11.670 --> 06:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators they know the most about
 
06:25:13.030 --> 06:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
the reproduction
 
06:25:14.788 --> 06:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
and what the needs are of an orphan
 
06:25:16.470 --> 06:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
squirrel and how much they need to be
 
06:25:18.390 --> 06:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
dependent on their mother
 
06:25:21.670 --> 06:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here today
 
06:25:23.190 --> 06:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you miss schneider any questions
 
06:25:25.110 --> 06:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
for miss snyder
 
06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for coming before
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the fishing game committee and thank you
 
06:25:30.470 --> 06:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
next up is robert kessling who is
 
06:25:35.430 --> 06:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
representing himself from manchester and
 
06:25:45.510 --> 06:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.430 --> 06:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
hi my name is robert kessling thank you
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony good afternoon
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm proud to support hb 1356 which seeks
 
06:25:54.628 --> 06:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
to delay
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
the season uh for just two weeks
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
although this may not seem like a lot of
 
06:26:01.670 --> 06:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
time these 14 days make a huge
 
06:26:04.470 --> 06:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
difference for the population
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
as you heard wildlife rehabilitators are
 
06:26:09.270 --> 06:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more orphaned squirrels
 
06:26:10.830 --> 06:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
after the start of the current
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
season these offspring are still in the
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
nest and dependent upon their mother and
 
06:26:18.070 --> 06:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think if you can imagine a uh
 
06:26:20.548 --> 06:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
a year old human baby how completely
 
06:26:22.948 --> 06:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
helpless they are now imagine the
 
06:26:24.470 --> 06:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
squirrel baby
 
06:26:26.150 --> 06:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
takes him a little less time to get out
 
06:26:27.830 --> 06:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the nest but they still need the help
 
06:26:29.910 --> 06:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
of their of their mother before they can
 
06:26:32.070 --> 06:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
do so
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
delaying the start of the hunting season
 
06:26:36.150 --> 06:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
by 14 days while having a minimal impact
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
on hunters as as stated so far would
 
06:26:43.190 --> 06:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide more time for the mother to
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
teach crucial
 
06:26:47.190 --> 06:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
survival skills to their offspring
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
so two weeks goes by and flash for us
 
06:26:51.190 --> 06:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure coming out of the holiday
 
06:26:53.110 --> 06:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
season you can look back and see two
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
weeks gone in no time but for a baby
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
squirrel uh that amount of time can mean
 
06:27:00.150 --> 06:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
life or death so
 
06:27:02.468 --> 06:27:02.478 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to protect the the
 
06:27:05.030 --> 06:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
eastern gray squirrel babies
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the population please vote yes on
 
06:27:08.788 --> 06:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:27:11.830 --> 06:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:15.430 --> 06:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
is there questions for mr kessling
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:25.510 --> 06:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
next up oh i'm gonna mess this one up
 
06:27:25.520 --> 06:27:27.190 align:start position:0%
next up oh i'm gonna mess this one up
tone

06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
tone
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
tone let's just do that
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
you can you can say your last name when
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
you get up here
 
06:27:41.030 --> 06:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today this
 
06:27:45.910 --> 06:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be very short and sweet
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:51.510 --> 06:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
for me to say i am in here in support of
 
06:27:54.070 --> 06:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill 1356 because quite frankly
 
06:27:56.628 --> 06:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
squirrels can't speak for themselves
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh and if
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
i don't speak up for them i'm not sure
 
06:28:01.910 --> 06:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
who will
 
06:28:04.230 --> 06:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's many of us out here who care but
 
06:28:07.430 --> 06:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm like to put my voice out there
 
06:28:09.270 --> 06:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
as a civilized society i believe we need
 
06:28:11.350 --> 06:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
to minimize the suffering
 
06:28:11.360 --> 06:28:12.390 align:start position:0%
to minimize the suffering
of

06:28:12.390 --> 06:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
not just human babies but non-human
 
06:28:16.468 --> 06:28:16.478 align:start position:0%
babies as well
 
06:28:17.910 --> 06:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think you need to be a mother or
 
06:28:20.070 --> 06:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
father to recognize why leaving orphaned
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
babies in the wild to languish and
 
06:28:24.868 --> 06:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
suffer with little to no means to feed
 
06:28:29.670 --> 06:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:32.788 --> 06:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
but you do need to have empathy
 
06:28:34.548 --> 06:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
this is extremely poor management and
 
06:28:37.030 --> 06:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
treatment of our wildlife
 
06:28:39.830 --> 06:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i ask you to please vote yes on this
 
06:28:41.430 --> 06:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
06:28:43.110 --> 06:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions can
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
you tell me how you say your last name
 
06:28:47.910 --> 06:28:47.920 align:start position:0%

rochelle
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:28:51.430 --> 06:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming for the fish and
 
06:28:53.430 --> 06:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
game committee thank you
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
next up is dan berceron new hampshire
 
06:28:59.990 --> 06:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
fish and game in opposition to the bill
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
um just let people know we have six more
 
06:29:03.510 --> 06:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
speakers at least based on the cards i
 
06:29:11.750 --> 06:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:15.430 --> 06:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:16.708 --> 06:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
dan birdron chief of the wildlife

06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
here representing the department the
 
06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
commission in opposition of hb 1356
 
06:29:27.510 --> 06:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
so gray squirrels have a hunting season
 
06:29:29.670 --> 06:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
in all five new england states in new
 
06:29:29.680 --> 06:29:30.628 align:start position:0%
in all five new england states in new
york

06:29:30.628 --> 06:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
york
 
06:29:33.190 --> 06:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
as is as has been mentioned in previous
 
06:29:33.200 --> 06:29:34.548 align:start position:0%
as is as has been mentioned in previous
testimony

06:29:34.548 --> 06:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
hunting seasons vary there are a number
 
06:29:38.150 --> 06:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
of states that start later than new
 
06:29:38.160 --> 06:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
of states that start later than new
hampshire

06:29:39.430 --> 06:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:29:40.788 --> 06:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states that start
 
06:29:42.548 --> 06:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
the same time so new hampshire vermont
 
06:29:44.150 --> 06:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
connecticut and new york
 
06:29:45.590 --> 06:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
all have similar start dates of
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
september 1st hunting seasons vary
 
06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
from state to state on a routine basis
 
06:29:54.548 --> 06:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
some of it is based on biology some of
 
06:29:56.310 --> 06:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
it is just based on tradition of where
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
the seasons typically took place
 
06:30:01.430 --> 06:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not unusual to have variation in
 
06:30:03.270 --> 06:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
the start dates or end dates of hunting
 
06:30:03.280 --> 06:30:05.270 align:start position:0%
the start dates or end dates of hunting
seasons

06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
seasons
 
06:30:06.628 --> 06:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
some of it deals with the amount of
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
hunting pressure and how that might vary
 
06:30:09.910 --> 06:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
environmental factors there's there's a
 
06:30:12.310 --> 06:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
number of reasons why season start dates
 
06:30:15.910 --> 06:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
or end dates might vary between states
 
06:30:18.788 --> 06:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
the department tracks both hunter effort
 
06:30:21.030 --> 06:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
and hunter observation rates of
 
06:30:21.040 --> 06:30:22.548 align:start position:0%
and hunter observation rates of
squirrels

06:30:22.548 --> 06:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
squirrels
 
06:30:25.590 --> 06:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
through our small game uh hunter survey
 
06:30:28.150 --> 06:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
data from this survey indicates um that
 
06:30:29.910 --> 06:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's very low hunting pressure on
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
grey squirrels approximately nine
 
06:30:33.830 --> 06:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
percent of small game hunters pursue
 
06:30:35.830 --> 06:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
gray squirrels
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
squirrel observation rates
 
06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we get from this hunter survey so
 
06:30:40.868 --> 06:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
that's the number of squirrels seen per
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
100 hours of hunting
 
06:30:45.030 --> 06:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
have been stable or increasing
 
06:30:48.390 --> 06:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the state over time
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
squirrel populations are largely driven
 
06:30:52.788 --> 06:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
by natural food availability and weather
 
06:30:52.798 --> 06:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
by natural food availability and weather
patterns

06:30:53.830 --> 06:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
patterns
 
06:30:55.510 --> 06:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
and annual fluctuations in their
 
06:30:58.230 --> 06:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
population levels are common
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
it's believed hunting mortality
 
06:31:01.990 --> 06:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
is is minimal
 
06:31:03.510 --> 06:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
as it compares to other sources of
 
06:31:03.520 --> 06:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
as it compares to other sources of
mortality

06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
part because hunting pressure is low
 
06:31:09.830 --> 06:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
and squirrels are a highly productive
 
06:31:09.840 --> 06:31:11.590 align:start position:0%
and squirrels are a highly productive
animal

06:31:11.590 --> 06:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
animal
 
06:31:14.310 --> 06:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate this point um
 
06:31:16.708 --> 06:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
our squirrel observation rates we
 
06:31:18.310 --> 06:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
noticed a decline
 
06:31:22.468 --> 06:31:22.478 align:start position:0%
um in 2000 uh or following 2018 um i'm
 
06:31:24.548 --> 06:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
sure you all remember the year of 2018
 
06:31:26.628 --> 06:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
there was a large scale mortality event
 
06:31:28.390 --> 06:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
of grey squirrels
 
06:31:29.750 --> 06:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
it was very evident they were all over
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
the roadways there was media coverage
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:31:36.230 --> 06:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
this mortality event was the result of
 
06:31:38.708 --> 06:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
abundant natural food availability
 
06:31:41.190 --> 06:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
for several years in a row that caused
 
06:31:43.590 --> 06:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the squirrel population to peak
 
06:31:46.070 --> 06:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
that was followed by a complete failure
 
06:31:48.310 --> 06:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
of natural foods
 
06:31:50.390 --> 06:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
when natural foods
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
when natural foods aren't available
 
06:31:51.760 --> 06:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
when natural foods aren't available
animals

06:31:53.190 --> 06:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
animals
 
06:31:54.948 --> 06:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
move and disperse more to find food
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
sources and they come in contact with
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles more often they get pretty pond
 
06:32:00.788 --> 06:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
more often
 
06:32:03.190 --> 06:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
but it was very evident um department
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
biologists conduct surveys of different
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
wildlife food sources on an annual basis
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it was very clear through the
 
06:32:12.468 --> 06:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
results of those surveys um that that
 
06:32:12.478 --> 06:32:13.270 align:start position:0%
results of those surveys um that that
main

06:32:13.270 --> 06:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
main
 
06:32:15.430 --> 06:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
food sources for squirrels namely acorns
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
and beech nuts um we're at a we're at a
 
06:32:19.910 --> 06:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
historical low
 
06:32:21.750 --> 06:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
resulting in this this large scale
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:25.200 --> 06:32:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:32:27.350 --> 06:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:27.360 --> 06:32:28.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:32:28.390 --> 06:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:30.708 --> 06:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
and again this this petition um the
 
06:32:32.310 --> 06:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
petition to change the start date of the
 
06:32:33.750 --> 06:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
squirrel season followed that large
 
06:32:35.910 --> 06:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
mortality event um
 
06:32:37.910 --> 06:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure that there were a number of
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
um orphan squirrels that showed up at
 
06:32:43.270 --> 06:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators um following this year um
 
06:32:45.190 --> 06:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
and and i think it's important to note
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
though that large-scale mortality events
 
06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
like that are not the norm
 
06:32:51.670 --> 06:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
in response to the petition that the
 
06:32:53.590 --> 06:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
commission received at the time
 
06:32:56.310 --> 06:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
department staff reviewed information on
 
06:32:58.150 --> 06:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
hunter effort on squirrel observation
 
06:32:58.160 --> 06:32:59.670 align:start position:0%
hunter effort on squirrel observation
rates

06:32:59.670 --> 06:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
rates
 
06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
you'd heard reference before two studies
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
one from massachusetts around 1976 1977
 
06:33:08.708 --> 06:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
and another from new york in 1994.
 
06:33:10.628 --> 06:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
these two studies
 
06:33:10.638 --> 06:33:11.590 align:start position:0%
these two studies
showed

06:33:11.590 --> 06:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
showed
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
so the massachusetts study um they they
 
06:33:16.628 --> 06:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
took hunter harvested squirrels checked
 
06:33:18.548 --> 06:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
lactation status to get an idea of how
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
many of these squirrels might still have
 
06:33:21.910 --> 06:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
dependent young
 
06:33:24.310 --> 06:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's true uh at that point when the
 
06:33:26.788 --> 06:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
study was conducted the start date for
 
06:33:28.390 --> 06:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts squirrel hunting season
 
06:33:31.110 --> 06:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
was the second monday in september
 
06:33:33.670 --> 06:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
what they found was approximately 1.3
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the squirrels that they
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
06:33:36.718 --> 06:33:38.830 align:start position:0%
looked at
were

06:33:38.830 --> 06:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:33:42.150 --> 06:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
lactating and then the new york study
 
06:33:43.590 --> 06:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
and in new york the start date was at
 
06:33:44.948 --> 06:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
the beginning of september similar to
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
also found a 1.3 percent
 
06:33:52.150 --> 06:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
of harvested squirrels were lactating
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
start dates of the seasons were
 
06:33:55.910 --> 06:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
different but these very low percentages
 
06:33:57.910 --> 06:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
indicate that the number of squirrels
 
06:33:59.910 --> 06:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
that are still lactating by september is
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:08.708 --> 06:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
we we did not consider the department
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
did not consider information from
 
06:34:10.558 --> 06:34:12.070 align:start position:0%
did not consider information from
rehabilitators

06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
in part because the information that we
 
06:34:15.990 --> 06:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
receive from rehabilitators
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
is not always complete so they don't
 
06:34:20.070 --> 06:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily indicate
 
06:34:22.310 --> 06:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether a squirrel is dependent young or
 
06:34:23.750 --> 06:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
not it might they might just indicate
 
06:34:25.750 --> 06:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that they accepted a squirrel so it's
 
06:34:28.788 --> 06:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a representative sample of
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
the overall population um
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
so it's difficult to make assumptions
 
06:34:38.070 --> 06:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
about an overall population based on
 
06:34:41.750 --> 06:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:43.830 --> 06:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
animals that come into rehabilitation
 
06:34:43.840 --> 06:34:45.350 align:start position:0%
animals that come into rehabilitation
centers

06:34:45.350 --> 06:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
centers
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
again a lot of these animals are likely
 
06:34:48.548 --> 06:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
coming from homes
 
06:34:50.468 --> 06:34:50.478 align:start position:0%
if someone trapped an animal
 
06:34:52.468 --> 06:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
um or or did
 
06:34:54.150 --> 06:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
did work to keep them out of their house
 
06:34:55.510 --> 06:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
then that's where people are likely
 
06:34:58.948 --> 06:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
coming in contact with these animals
 
06:34:58.958 --> 06:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
coming in contact with these animals
um

06:35:02.390 --> 06:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:05.110 --> 06:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard comments um suggesting that
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
the studies because they were um
 
06:35:09.030 --> 06:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
conducted in the past should not be
 
06:35:09.040 --> 06:35:10.150 align:start position:0%
conducted in the past should not be
considered

06:35:10.150 --> 06:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:35:11.750 --> 06:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and we've also heard comments
 
06:35:14.070 --> 06:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
recently that squirrels are changing
 
06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
their their timing of their breeding
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
because of climate change
 
06:35:18.558 --> 06:35:19.350 align:start position:0%
because of climate change
um

06:35:19.350 --> 06:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
biological staff
 
06:35:23.030 --> 06:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
did a research
 
06:35:23.040 --> 06:35:24.230 align:start position:0%
did a research
review

06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:35:26.150 --> 06:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
we could not find any research that
 
06:35:27.910 --> 06:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
indicated that the timing of breeding is
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
changing as a result of climate change
 
06:35:31.670 --> 06:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
what the research does show is that the
 
06:35:34.070 --> 06:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
main cue for reproduction in squirrels
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
is photo period
 
06:35:37.190 --> 06:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
or length of day
 
06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is a common reproductive cue in
 
06:35:41.110 --> 06:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife species
 
06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
it is consistent and it does not change
 
06:35:45.110 --> 06:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:35:48.708 --> 06:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
so from year to year it triggers hormone
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
production and then reproduction
 
06:35:53.590 --> 06:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
and it is used specifically because it
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
is consistent
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
as an example deer are another species
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
whose reproductive cue is photoperiod or
 
06:36:02.310 --> 06:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
day length
 
06:36:04.468 --> 06:36:04.478 align:start position:0%
the department has conducted studies on
 
06:36:06.868 --> 06:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
reproduction of deer in the state
 
06:36:09.270 --> 06:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
we conducted a study in the 1980s and
 
06:36:11.990 --> 06:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
then a similar study in 2013 and we
 
06:36:14.230 --> 06:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
found no significant difference in the
 
06:36:16.788 --> 06:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
timing of reproduction so
 
06:36:19.030 --> 06:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
historical studies on reproduction of
 
06:36:20.548 --> 06:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
species that are that are cued by
 
06:36:30.070 --> 06:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:32.548 --> 06:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
um so so given these findings um you
 
06:36:34.070 --> 06:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
know that squirrel reproduction is
 
06:36:36.230 --> 06:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
triggered by photo period
 
06:36:39.510 --> 06:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
that these two studies found very low
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
percentages of squirrels that were
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
lactating in september
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that hunting pressure on
 
06:36:47.030 --> 06:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
squirrels is low in the state that
 
06:36:48.628 --> 06:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
squirrels are highly productive and that
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
observation rates indicate that the
 
06:36:51.830 --> 06:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
squirrel population is stable or
 
06:36:53.990 --> 06:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the department does not feel
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
that the continued
 
06:36:57.350 --> 06:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
season framework of the start date of
 
06:36:59.350 --> 06:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
september 1st will have a negative
 
06:37:01.830 --> 06:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
impact on the state squirrel population
 
06:37:04.150 --> 06:37:04.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i just have one
 
06:37:13.910 --> 06:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
have grey squirrels ever been endangered
 
06:37:16.868 --> 06:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
as a population in new hampshire no
 
06:37:18.230 --> 06:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:20.310 --> 06:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
06:37:23.110 --> 06:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i
 
06:37:26.390 --> 06:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand that given all the evidence
 
06:37:29.030 --> 06:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
you just gave your determination is that
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear the september first
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
start date doesn't appear to be having
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
any kind of bad impact on the population
 
06:37:38.788 --> 06:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
and i understand that but considering
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
that this may have been a clerical error
 
06:37:45.270 --> 06:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question is why not change
 
06:37:47.190 --> 06:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
it to mid-september
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
better safe than sorry what is there any
 
06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
harm in changing it to mid-september
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i would
 
06:37:55.190 --> 06:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
i would have to do some research on
 
06:37:56.788 --> 06:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not this was a clerical error
 
06:37:58.788 --> 06:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
i would i would find it hard to believe
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
that it was a clerical error
 
06:38:03.270 --> 06:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
in in part because
 
06:38:04.628 --> 06:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
not only when we go through the
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process not only do
 
06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
we file the rules
 
06:38:11.110 --> 06:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
um we file the rules through jail carr
 
06:38:13.030 --> 06:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
and legislative services
 
06:38:14.788 --> 06:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
they don't do all their reviews there
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
but i mean we give presentations to the
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
public where these dates are posted all
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
this information ends up going into our
 
06:38:22.150 --> 06:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
hunting digest and online so the
 
06:38:23.510 --> 06:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the date would have been
 
06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
missed in all those different places
 
06:38:27.430 --> 06:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
seems unlikely to me
 
06:38:29.750 --> 06:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
2004 was before my time so i can check
 
06:38:31.590 --> 06:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
on that but i would find it hard to
 
06:38:33.270 --> 06:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
believe that that it was missed in so
 
06:38:37.030 --> 06:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
just a simple follow-up because i'm i
 
06:38:41.030 --> 06:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
serve on jalgar doesn't your rules have
 
06:38:43.750 --> 06:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be reaffirmed every 10 years
 
06:38:46.788 --> 06:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
um i believe so yeah
 
06:38:48.708 --> 06:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
so the 2004 rule would have been
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:52.320 --> 06:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:38:53.910 --> 06:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:38:56.070 --> 06:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um do you have any
 
06:38:58.948 --> 06:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the advisability of as was
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
suggested by previous speaker
 
06:39:02.788 --> 06:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
of permitting hunting gray squirrels
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
year round
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
so we feel that the current season
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
framework is a good compromise um
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
between between individuals who who just
 
06:39:15.110 --> 06:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
enjoy squirrels for intrinsic reasons
 
06:39:16.948 --> 06:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
and hunters
 
06:39:18.868 --> 06:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms for individuals who
 
06:39:21.030 --> 06:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
are experiencing damage to
 
06:39:23.670 --> 06:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
to to combat those issues so we feel the
 
06:39:24.868 --> 06:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
current season framework is a good
 
06:39:27.270 --> 06:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
compromise between multiple parties
 
06:39:29.110 --> 06:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
there being then mr bergeron thank you
 
06:39:38.468 --> 06:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:40.230 --> 06:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
so we have four more speakers
 
06:39:40.240 --> 06:39:41.590 align:start position:0%
so we have four more speakers
um

06:39:41.590 --> 06:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:44.948 --> 06:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:04.150 --> 06:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:04.160 --> 06:40:06.468 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
well the first thing i'd say well
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of community the first
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
thing i'd say it's really unfortunate
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
that this kind of issue has to be
 
06:40:17.910 --> 06:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
brought before the legislature but
 
06:40:19.750 --> 06:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
considering that in my opinion new
 
06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game dropped the ball
 
06:40:21.840 --> 06:40:23.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game dropped the ball
on

06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:40:26.390 --> 06:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
the rationale for denying the petition
 
06:40:28.948 --> 06:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
i think there's a process here that is
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:36.070 --> 06:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
we were just told the reasons
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
there i've looked at those reasons i
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
think the first thing about where our
 
06:40:43.110 --> 06:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring states start the season is
 
06:40:44.868 --> 06:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
totally irrelevant to what new hampshire
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
does it's different
 
06:40:48.390 --> 06:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
seasons change depending upon the
 
06:40:48.400 --> 06:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
seasons change depending upon the
latitude

06:40:49.750 --> 06:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
06:40:49.760 --> 06:40:50.788 align:start position:0%
latitude
and

06:40:50.788 --> 06:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:40:53.510 --> 06:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
if anybody is
 
06:40:55.830 --> 06:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
i guess interested in what the seasons
 
06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
are going all the way down the eastern
 
06:40:59.190 --> 06:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
seaboard you'll find that as you go
 
06:41:01.510 --> 06:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
further south of seasons or later i
 
06:41:04.070 --> 06:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
think a testimony to the fact that uh
 
06:41:07.510 --> 06:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's not just photo period that triggers
 
06:41:10.070 --> 06:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
squirrel breeding it's also warmth in
 
06:41:12.310 --> 06:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
fact the southern states have less light
 
06:41:16.468 --> 06:41:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:18.868 --> 06:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
climate change is a thing that is uh
 
06:41:21.190 --> 06:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
obviously controversial controversial
 
06:41:23.510 --> 06:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
from political standpoint but our fish
 
06:41:25.510 --> 06:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
and game has been considering the
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
effects of climate change on wildlife
 
06:41:29.350 --> 06:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
since 2005
 
06:41:31.830 --> 06:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
as part of the wildlife action plan and
 
06:41:33.510 --> 06:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
one of their former
 
06:41:35.670 --> 06:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
fur bearing biologists has lectured
 
06:41:38.548 --> 06:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
around the state over the last 10 or 12
 
06:41:40.548 --> 06:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
years about how that is affecting
 
06:41:40.558 --> 06:41:41.670 align:start position:0%
years about how that is affecting
wildlife

06:41:41.670 --> 06:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
06:41:43.910 --> 06:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think from a deductive reasoning if we
 
06:41:46.708 --> 06:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
say you know the fact that
 
06:41:49.430 --> 06:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
seasons get later as you go south that
 
06:41:52.468 --> 06:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
have more warmth that you'd see that the
 
06:41:54.070 --> 06:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
argument that the
 
06:41:56.150 --> 06:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
season should be later
 
06:41:58.070 --> 06:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
up here in new hampshire as
 
06:42:00.628 --> 06:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
the season as the climate changes
 
06:42:02.468 --> 06:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
is supportable
 
06:42:05.910 --> 06:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
the um so i i think uh the testimony
 
06:42:07.750 --> 06:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
that i submitted that and ms snyder
 
06:42:09.590 --> 06:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
submitted would give you the idea of
 
06:42:09.600 --> 06:42:10.628 align:start position:0%
submitted would give you the idea of
when

06:42:10.628 --> 06:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
season should start if one wanted to
 
06:42:14.868 --> 06:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
protect the young and the nest
 
06:42:17.430 --> 06:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
who are basically dependent on the
 
06:42:19.110 --> 06:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
mother for the first seeks with six
 
06:42:21.830 --> 06:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
weeks up to ten weeks
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
thing i want to take a little bit of uh
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
06:42:31.830 --> 06:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
exception to is the other reasons
 
06:42:33.670 --> 06:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
submitted in the denial of the petition
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
06:42:37.430 --> 06:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the game survey that showed only nine
 
06:42:39.270 --> 06:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
percent of the small game hunters hunt
 
06:42:41.190 --> 06:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
squirrels what does that mean nine
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
percent does that mean
 
06:42:45.830 --> 06:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
a hundred or a thousand it has no
 
06:42:47.830 --> 06:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
relationship to the pressure put on the
 
06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:51.120 --> 06:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:42:54.390 --> 06:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
so-called literature that was cited in
 
06:42:55.910 --> 06:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
the denial of the petition are
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
essentially internal progress reports
 
06:43:01.110 --> 06:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
that are on not peer-reviewed at all in
 
06:43:01.120 --> 06:43:01.990 align:start position:0%
that are on not peer-reviewed at all in
fact

06:43:01.990 --> 06:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:43:04.868 --> 06:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
the number of two percent lactating
 
06:43:07.590 --> 06:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
is basically khan is contradicted by the
 
06:43:09.590 --> 06:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts report that shows that
 
06:43:09.600 --> 06:43:11.190 align:start position:0%
massachusetts report that shows that
squirrels

06:43:11.190 --> 06:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
squirrels
 
06:43:14.390 --> 06:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
in september and october have uh i i
 
06:43:16.868 --> 06:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
provided this as part of the thing the
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
percent of adult females with enlarged
 
06:43:22.390 --> 06:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
teats ranges from 60 to 100 percent
 
06:43:24.628 --> 06:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
suggesting that they are lactating all
 
06:43:27.350 --> 06:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
the way through oh maybe the end of
 
06:43:27.360 --> 06:43:28.628 align:start position:0%
the way through oh maybe the end of
october

06:43:28.628 --> 06:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
october
 
06:43:30.468 --> 06:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't taken in consideration
 
06:43:32.868 --> 06:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
either so i think for those reasons
 
06:43:35.270 --> 06:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
although the
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
legislature should have to make these
 
06:43:39.270 --> 06:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions it should be sent
 
06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
back to fish and game for them to do a
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
thorough research on squirrel biology
 
06:43:44.240 --> 06:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
thorough research on squirrel biology
here

06:43:45.030 --> 06:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:43:48.070 --> 06:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'm i will say
 
06:43:49.830 --> 06:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
to those who are worried about being run
 
06:43:52.548 --> 06:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
over by squirrels and other rodents
 
06:43:53.590 --> 06:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:43:55.910 --> 06:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
our ability it's not our role to kill
 
06:43:57.910 --> 06:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
all the rodents is it
 
06:44:00.310 --> 06:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
if only we had a good healthy population
 
06:44:01.590 --> 06:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
of predators
 
06:44:01.600 --> 06:44:02.868 align:start position:0%
of predators
unfortunately

06:44:02.868 --> 06:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's another
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we don't have here in new
 
06:44:06.868 --> 06:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire because the
 
06:44:09.510 --> 06:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
populations of furbearing predators have
 
06:44:09.520 --> 06:44:10.868 align:start position:0%
populations of furbearing predators have
decreased

06:44:10.868 --> 06:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
06:44:12.868 --> 06:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
50 or 60 percent over the last two
 
06:44:15.910 --> 06:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
decades which is irrelevant to this bill
 
06:44:18.230 --> 06:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
but it is relevant to man's role in
 
06:44:20.310 --> 06:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
controlling their environment thank you
 
06:44:21.830 --> 06:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr bosworth any questions for
 
06:44:24.788 --> 06:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
mr bosworth
 
06:44:26.230 --> 06:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming for the fishing
 
06:44:28.868 --> 06:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
game committee
 
06:44:32.230 --> 06:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
next up is joseph mullen who was opposed
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
he's from the congressional sportsmen's
 
06:44:35.600 --> 06:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
he's from the congressional sportsmen's
foundation

06:44:51.030 --> 06:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:52.390 --> 06:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman lang and
 
06:44:53.830 --> 06:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the house fish and
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
game and marine resources committee my
 
06:44:58.070 --> 06:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
name is joe mullen i'm from grafton
 
06:45:00.390 --> 06:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and i'm the northeastern
 
06:45:02.070 --> 06:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
states assistant manager for the
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
congressional sportsman's foundation i
 
06:45:06.070 --> 06:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
appear before you this afternoon to
 
06:45:07.830 --> 06:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
express my strong opposition to house
 
06:45:09.830 --> 06:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1356
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
i plan on supplementing my testimony
 
06:45:14.070 --> 06:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
with a letter of opposition so i'm just
 
06:45:15.670 --> 06:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to provide some of my primary
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
arguments against this bill
 
06:45:21.350 --> 06:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
simply put house bill 1356 would subvert
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire fish and game
 
06:45:24.310 --> 06:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
department's authority when it comes to
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
setting the gray squirrel hunting
 
06:45:25.520 --> 06:45:26.868 align:start position:0%
setting the gray squirrel hunting
seasons

06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
seasons
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
the first and likely most obvious case
 
06:45:30.708 --> 06:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
for not stripping the department of this
 
06:45:30.718 --> 06:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
for not stripping the department of this
role

06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
role
 
06:45:33.190 --> 06:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that the department is in the best
 
06:45:35.670 --> 06:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
position to make sound science-based
 
06:45:37.430 --> 06:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
management decisions
 
06:45:39.030 --> 06:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
for over a century
 
06:45:41.430 --> 06:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
and a half the department has been
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
driving force behind new hampshire's
 
06:45:45.030 --> 06:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
on-the-ground efforts that have resulted
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
in flourishing wildlife populations
 
06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
the department is composed of a force of
 
06:45:52.708 --> 06:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
highly educated and widely experienced
 
06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
staff which includes a multitude of
 
06:45:57.270 --> 06:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
biologists policy experts and support
 
06:45:59.430 --> 06:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
and enforcement personnel
 
06:46:01.110 --> 06:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
all of whom have instrumental roles in
 
06:46:02.628 --> 06:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
determining the appropriate seasons for
 
06:46:04.708 --> 06:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
not only gray squirrels but all game

species
 
06:46:08.628 --> 06:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
should the department decide to make any
 
06:46:10.628 --> 06:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
rule changes for a particular year must
 
06:46:12.150 --> 06:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
follow the established rulemaking
 
06:46:13.590 --> 06:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
process that provides a wealth of
 
06:46:16.628 --> 06:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
transparency at all points it's also in
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
a unique position where it is able to
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
react to changing conditions in real
 
06:46:20.160 --> 06:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
react to changing conditions in real
time

06:46:21.430 --> 06:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:46:22.948 --> 06:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
through evaluating the many variables
 
06:46:24.468 --> 06:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
that go towards setting a grey squirrel
 
06:46:26.310 --> 06:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
hunting season and utilizing
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
inter-departmental collaboration
 
06:46:30.150 --> 06:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
it would be able to shorten or expand
 
06:46:32.310 --> 06:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
the season relying on current data and
 
06:46:32.320 --> 06:46:33.910 align:start position:0%
the season relying on current data and

06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'll wrap up by reiterating my
 
06:46:38.548 --> 06:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1356. i thank

claremont
 
06:47:11.430 --> 06:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
i've been a lifelong outdoor enthusiast
 
06:47:12.868 --> 06:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
but i only took up hunting three years
 
06:47:14.708 --> 06:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
ago and i actually started hunting with
 
06:47:16.230 --> 06:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
grey squirrel it's a great way to get
 
06:47:18.548 --> 06:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
introduced to the sport
 
06:47:20.150 --> 06:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
i love squirrels i think they're
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
fascinating beautiful awesome cool
 
06:47:25.110 --> 06:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
creatures i also like to use them as
 
06:47:27.190 --> 06:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
part of my meals and i try to use as
 
06:47:28.868 --> 06:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
much of the animal as possible the fur
 
06:47:30.628 --> 06:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
the tail and i have my squirrel foot
 
06:47:33.270 --> 06:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
handmade earrings that i made on today
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
but i'm not speaking personally i am
 
06:47:37.350 --> 06:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of bha again i've
 
06:47:38.788 --> 06:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
condensed this a little bit because
 
06:47:42.948 --> 06:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
a core principle of back country hunters
 
06:47:47.190 --> 06:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
and anglers is its support for the north
 
06:47:49.990 --> 06:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
american model of wildlife conservation
 
06:47:51.590 --> 06:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
under this model we've empowered the
 
06:47:53.910 --> 06:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
department with a set of tools including
 
06:47:55.670 --> 06:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to set season dates and
 
06:47:57.510 --> 06:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
lengths bag limits and appropriate
 
06:47:59.110 --> 06:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
methods of take which combined with
 
06:48:01.350 --> 06:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
current science and biological evidence
 
06:48:03.030 --> 06:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
allows them to effectively manage the
 
06:48:04.868 --> 06:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
state's game species
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
hp 1356 imposes a limitation on when the
 
06:48:09.830 --> 06:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
gray squirrel season starts which
 
06:48:11.190 --> 06:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
essentially removes one of these
 
06:48:13.030 --> 06:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife management tools from the
 
06:48:14.708 --> 06:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
department and puts it into the
 
06:48:16.948 --> 06:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
legislative realm going forward this
 
06:48:18.548 --> 06:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
would hinder the department's ability to
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
fulfill their mandate maintaining that
 
06:48:22.628 --> 06:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
solely the department has the ability to
 
06:48:24.708 --> 06:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
set season dates and also helps to
 
06:48:26.468 --> 06:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
ensure that changes are motivated by
 
06:48:28.708 --> 06:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
biological evidence and management needs
 
06:48:30.230 --> 06:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
as opposed to public opinion and
 
06:48:30.240 --> 06:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
as opposed to public opinion and
preferences

06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
preferences
 
06:48:33.510 --> 06:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
for these reasons on behalf of bha's
 
06:48:35.030 --> 06:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
members in new hampshire we ask that you
 
06:48:38.070 --> 06:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
oppose h.b 1356 thank you all for the
 
06:48:39.910 --> 06:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today and for
 
06:48:42.310 --> 06:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
taking our comments into consideration
 
06:48:44.948 --> 06:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you elise any questions for elise
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you again for coming
 
06:48:48.150 --> 06:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
before the fish and game committee
 
06:48:50.548 --> 06:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
last speaker is kyle baker of the new
 
06:48:52.628 --> 06:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire wildlife federation in
 
06:49:01.670 --> 06:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:03.670 --> 06:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again i'll be very brief
 
06:49:04.948 --> 06:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
since most of my points have already
 
06:49:04.958 --> 06:49:06.628 align:start position:0%
since most of my points have already
been

06:49:06.628 --> 06:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure you're up to the mic so people
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
can hear you most of my points have
 
06:49:11.350 --> 06:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
already been taken but i'm kyle baker
 
06:49:12.788 --> 06:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of new hampshire wildlife
 
06:49:14.948 --> 06:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
federation with concerns about this
 
06:49:17.190 --> 06:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill our main concern doesn't
 
06:49:19.110 --> 06:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
deal with whether or not which date the
 
06:49:21.030 --> 06:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
season should be set at it's how the
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
season is set um we strongly believe uh
 
06:49:26.070 --> 06:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
similar to speakers before us that
 
06:49:28.070 --> 06:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
the best place to have discussions about
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
setting the seasons um is within the
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
fishing games biennial rule making
 
06:49:31.360 --> 06:49:32.628 align:start position:0%
fishing games biennial rule making
process

06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:49:32.638 --> 06:49:33.350 align:start position:0%
process
so

06:49:33.350 --> 06:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:49:35.430 --> 06:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
that is pretty much all i wanted to
 
06:49:37.030 --> 06:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
touch on we would say that if the
 
06:49:38.310 --> 06:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee was interested in moving
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward with something similar to this
 
06:49:41.750 --> 06:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
we think a more appropriate method would
 
06:49:44.230 --> 06:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
be to then direct the department to
 
06:49:45.910 --> 06:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
reopen this role making process and look
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
into it
 
06:49:48.628 --> 06:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
providing opportunity for continued
 
06:49:51.350 --> 06:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input
 
06:49:53.270 --> 06:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony any
 
06:49:55.030 --> 06:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions for mr baker
 
06:49:56.868 --> 06:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
06:49:59.030 --> 06:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i actually tried
 
06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
to ask a question last time but you
 
06:50:01.510 --> 06:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
brought up the same issue as the
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
previous speaker so i'll ask you instead
 
06:50:05.830 --> 06:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and i don't have the bill right well
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
it probably is right in front of me but
 
06:50:09.510 --> 06:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
i cannot find it right now
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
but i believe if i'm not mistaken that
 
06:50:12.708 --> 06:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
sets a limit but allows the department
 
06:50:17.830 --> 06:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
to set the date later isn't that the
 
06:50:20.150 --> 06:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
case and if it is the case doesn't that
 
06:50:22.548 --> 06:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
also mean that the department still has
 
06:50:25.030 --> 06:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of discretion to set the date
 
06:50:26.628 --> 06:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for the question yes
 
06:50:29.590 --> 06:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
the the bill does just set a sort of a
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
dead stop you know you cannot start
 
06:50:33.430 --> 06:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
before this particular date uh it would
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
be the one and only unique um situation
 
06:50:38.230 --> 06:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
where we've essentially stripped the
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
authority of the fish and game
 
06:50:41.510 --> 06:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
department to determine whether or not
 
06:50:43.030 --> 06:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's september 1st september
 
06:50:45.510 --> 06:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
15th or august 15th depending on what
 
06:50:47.110 --> 06:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
the what the current and most up-to-date
 
06:50:51.030 --> 06:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:54.310 --> 06:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions for mr baker
 
06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr baker
 
06:50:56.868 --> 06:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony today thank
 
06:50:57.990 --> 06:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
you for coming for the fish and game

06:51:08.468 --> 06:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
there being none i'm just gonna have a
 
06:51:09.670 --> 06:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
couple minute conversation with the
 
06:51:11.270 --> 06:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
06:51:11.280 --> 06:51:12.310 align:start position:0%
committee um
so

06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:15.910 --> 06:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm inclined to hold this till the 25th
 
06:51:17.990 --> 06:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm also you know
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that in every other
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
instance we've defaulted to the fact
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
that we allow fish and game the right to
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
manage their season and this flies in
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
the face of that i'm pretty sure fish
 
06:51:31.190 --> 06:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
and game got the message loud and clear
 
06:51:32.548 --> 06:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
about what the will of the people are
 
06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and they may they may take it up on
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
their own um after this but um i guess
 
06:51:39.270 --> 06:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm you know do we do we think we need
 
06:51:41.990 --> 06:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
to move you know uh continue this bill
 
06:51:43.830 --> 06:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
or do we think there's an itl motion
 
06:51:45.190 --> 06:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
that should be made
 
06:51:46.628 --> 06:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative reid first then
 
06:51:48.310 --> 06:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine
 
06:51:51.270 --> 06:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and while i
 
06:51:53.670 --> 06:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
understand your point that we've sent a
 
06:51:55.350 --> 06:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
message and we're hoping that the
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
commission will uh react to the will of
 
06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
the people i can
 
06:52:02.150 --> 06:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for this but before you
 
06:52:03.830 --> 06:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
were on this committee i can attest to
 
06:52:05.750 --> 06:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that messages have been sent
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
about this very type of issue about
 
06:52:08.160 --> 06:52:09.030 align:start position:0%
about this very type of issue about
people

06:52:09.030 --> 06:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
expressing their opinion that ignored
 
06:52:15.110 --> 06:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:16.468 --> 06:52:16.478 align:start position:0%
we should hold on to this bill a little
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
bit longer
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine thank you mr
 
06:52:22.310 --> 06:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
chair i think that um
 
06:52:24.548 --> 06:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
i would entertain a motion to itl this
 
06:52:25.990 --> 06:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
and think that that would be the proper
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
disposition today to allow us to move
 
06:52:30.230 --> 06:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
forward with the next bill and get it
 
06:52:31.510 --> 06:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
off our plate
 
06:52:32.868 --> 06:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think that anything is going to
 
06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
change between now and the 25th
 
06:52:38.230 --> 06:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
i moved to itl the bill uh we're not in
 
06:52:39.350 --> 06:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
executive session we're just in
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
discussion right now so there's no
 
06:52:42.948 --> 06:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
motions on the floor i'm i'm gonna i'm
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
gonna hold the bill to the 25th i think
 
06:52:46.948 --> 06:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for the members to have
 
06:52:49.270 --> 06:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion about this and again
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
again about that policy we generally
 
06:52:52.948 --> 06:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
have about leaving hunting seasons and
 
06:52:55.030 --> 06:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
taking seasons to the purview of fish
 
06:52:57.190 --> 06:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
and game and not starting putting them
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
in statutes that lead us down the road
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we want to go
 
06:53:03.750 --> 06:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the every species and what
 
06:53:05.910 --> 06:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the hunting season should be
 
06:53:07.190 --> 06:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
and whether we leave that with fish and
 
06:53:08.628 --> 06:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
game but i'll leave it to the 25th and
 
06:53:09.750 --> 06:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to close the public
 
06:53:14.628 --> 06:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:16.628 --> 06:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a few minute recess
 
06:53:19.350 --> 06:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
let's come back at 405. so you've got
 
06:53:22.390 --> 06:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
about 13 minutes uh use a bio break take
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
stretch your legs and we'll come back
 
06:53:25.270 --> 06:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll take up the final bill of the
 
07:04:30.788 --> 07:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:32.310 --> 07:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
all right if members can start making
 
07:04:34.070 --> 07:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
their way to the sea we've got about 30
 
07:04:35.590 --> 07:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
seconds here before we're ready to kick
 
07:04:38.548 --> 07:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
it off i will tell you we have 20 20
 
07:04:40.548 --> 07:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
cards of people who wish to testify on
 
07:04:41.590 --> 07:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:04:43.270 --> 07:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
and because of that i'm going to ask i'm
 
07:04:44.868 --> 07:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to limit testimony to two and a
 
07:04:46.230 --> 07:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
half minutes
 
07:04:48.150 --> 07:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
give people time to testify but try to
 
07:04:50.230 --> 07:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
tight that does not that does not apply
 
07:04:51.590 --> 07:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor
 
07:04:53.910 --> 07:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
and does not apply to the department who
 
07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
is generally answering all of our
 
07:04:58.468 --> 07:04:58.478 align:start position:0%
questions as as uh as the expert in the
 
07:05:00.868 --> 07:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
field so those two agent the agency
 
07:05:02.948 --> 07:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
itself and the sponsor will be able to
 
07:05:04.628 --> 07:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
speak for as long as necessary as they
 
07:05:06.390 --> 07:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
need to answer our questions and give
 
07:05:08.468 --> 07:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
testimony and then but everybody else be
 
07:05:10.070 --> 07:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
held to a two and a half minute mark and
 
07:05:11.110 --> 07:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
we'll give you
 
07:05:12.948 --> 07:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know that mr the vice chair over
 
07:05:14.230 --> 07:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
here is going to keep the timer and
 
07:05:15.910 --> 07:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
he'll put his hand up when he got 30
 
07:05:17.590 --> 07:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
seconds so you have time to wrap up your
 
07:05:19.590 --> 07:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
thing people are settling themselves i'm
 
07:05:21.270 --> 07:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to hold up something
 
07:05:25.190 --> 07:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is a picture of the snowshoe fair
 
07:05:28.230 --> 07:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
done in a book that my husband was given
 
07:05:30.150 --> 07:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
when he was eight years old
 
07:05:32.070 --> 07:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
about wild animals
 
07:05:33.750 --> 07:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the united states
 
07:05:36.868 --> 07:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
and of course it shows the snowshoe hair
 
07:05:39.030 --> 07:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the winter being white
 
07:05:41.830 --> 07:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the summer being brown
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a beautiful picture
 
07:05:46.390 --> 07:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's certainly one of the things that
 
07:05:50.628 --> 07:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
makes and impels me to speak today
 
07:05:51.510 --> 07:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:05:53.830 --> 07:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're back and we're live and uh i'm
 
07:05:56.548 --> 07:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
gonna open up the public uh hearing on
 
07:05:58.948 --> 07:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 308 prohibiting to capture
 
07:06:01.110 --> 07:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
possession propagation of hairs rabbits
 
07:06:03.510 --> 07:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
and hunting for hunting dog training and
 
07:06:05.030 --> 07:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
field trials
 
07:06:05.040 --> 07:06:05.910 align:start position:0%
field trials
so

07:06:05.910 --> 07:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:06:08.548 --> 07:06:08.558 align:start position:0%

07:06:23.190 --> 07:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat but i have spent quite a lot of
 
07:06:25.830 --> 07:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
time researching this topic about which
 
07:06:28.390 --> 07:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
i knew very little when i began i want
 
07:06:31.190 --> 07:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
to start my introduction
 
07:06:34.468 --> 07:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
i'm a representative from coast county i
 
07:06:36.708 --> 07:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
live in randolph i represent whitefield
 
07:06:40.070 --> 07:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
jefferson carroll and randolph
 
07:06:42.628 --> 07:06:42.638 align:start position:0%

07:06:45.430 --> 07:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
i was just appointed recently to gelcar
 
07:06:45.440 --> 07:06:46.310 align:start position:0%
i was just appointed recently to gelcar
the

07:06:46.310 --> 07:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:06:47.990 --> 07:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on
 
07:06:50.230 --> 07:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
administrative rules i'm still an
 
07:06:50.240 --> 07:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
administrative rules i'm still an
alternate

07:06:51.910 --> 07:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
alternate
 
07:06:53.670 --> 07:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
which means i don't get to vote unless
 
07:06:55.910 --> 07:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's a vacancy on the committee that
 
07:06:57.990 --> 07:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
particular day but one of the first
 
07:07:00.948 --> 07:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
meetings i attended voices of wildlife a
 
07:07:03.270 --> 07:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization which i had not
 
07:07:06.150 --> 07:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
run into before of volunteers
 
07:07:08.390 --> 07:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
sought to repeal the fish and game
 
07:07:11.110 --> 07:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
provisions for beagle clubs and snowshoe
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
hare that are addressed in this bill
 
07:07:16.310 --> 07:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
jelcar decided however that if such
 
07:07:18.708 --> 07:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
changes were to be made it should be
 
07:07:21.430 --> 07:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and not
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
by just changing rules linda dion who
 
07:07:27.350 --> 07:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
had testified on behalf of voices
 
07:07:29.750 --> 07:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
asked if there were any jail car members
 
07:07:31.830 --> 07:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
who would like to help with bill making
 
07:07:34.948 --> 07:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
legislative process gel carr chairman
 
07:07:37.910 --> 07:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
senator john regan of deerfield and i
 
07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
both committed ourselves to doing so
 
07:07:42.390 --> 07:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
so i made that commitment because i
 
07:07:44.868 --> 07:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
believe what new hampshire fish and game
 
07:07:46.628 --> 07:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
currently allows
 
07:07:48.708 --> 07:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
the live trapping and transfer of
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hair
 
07:07:52.468 --> 07:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
away from their home grounds
 
07:07:54.948 --> 07:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
to use be used by in
 
07:07:54.958 --> 07:07:56.548 align:start position:0%
to use be used by in
large

07:07:56.548 --> 07:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
large
 
07:07:56.558 --> 07:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
large
uh

07:07:58.070 --> 07:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:08:00.070 --> 07:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
for state beagle clubs for training

after all
 
07:08:47.990 --> 07:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
no one would advocate for live trapping

so it could be used to train bear hounds

and no one would propose that game bird

07:14:29.430 --> 07:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
07:14:31.510 --> 07:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
i thank you for hearing me today
 
07:14:35.910 --> 07:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:37.910 --> 07:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
07:14:40.230 --> 07:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i provided you all with tesla with
 
07:14:42.310 --> 07:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony and i'll i'll make it
 
07:14:44.628 --> 07:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
as short and sweet as i can
 
07:14:44.638 --> 07:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
as short and sweet as i can
um

07:14:45.590 --> 07:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:51.230 --> 07:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:53.990 --> 07:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
hb-1308 for many years i was a hunter
 
07:14:56.070 --> 07:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
mostly rabbits
 
07:14:59.430 --> 07:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
mostly in the north country
 
07:15:01.590 --> 07:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
meridian hill my special
 
07:15:05.430 --> 07:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:06.548 --> 07:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
i would
 
07:15:08.628 --> 07:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
in all my years of training using my
 
07:15:10.708 --> 07:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
dogs for the purpose of hunting i would
 
07:15:12.788 --> 07:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
have never considered capturing holding
 
07:15:13.990 --> 07:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
or using
 
07:15:15.590 --> 07:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
rabbits as bait
 
07:15:20.230 --> 07:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
for training my dogs and let there be no
 
07:15:20.240 --> 07:15:21.310 align:start position:0%
for training my dogs and let there be no
no

07:15:21.310 --> 07:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:15:21.320 --> 07:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
no
misunderstanding

07:15:23.270 --> 07:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
07:15:24.788 --> 07:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
rabbits are bait
 
07:15:27.750 --> 07:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
used in this particular instance
 
07:15:29.670 --> 07:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's no different than putting a worm on
 
07:15:32.468 --> 07:15:32.478 align:start position:0%
a hook and never catching a fish
 
07:15:33.670 --> 07:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
you've still
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
killed the worm
 
07:15:37.590 --> 07:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
propagation of these animals would
 
07:15:39.430 --> 07:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
likely cause them to become somewhat
 
07:15:42.310 --> 07:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
domesticated and not wild animals
 
07:15:43.910 --> 07:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is what hunting rules were
 
07:15:47.110 --> 07:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
intended for wild animals are not bait
 
07:15:49.350 --> 07:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
putting donuts and scraps out to bait a
 
07:15:52.548 --> 07:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
bear or corn out for a deer i understand
 
07:15:52.558 --> 07:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
bear or corn out for a deer i understand
this

07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:15:55.990 --> 07:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
but raising one animal to train another
 
07:15:57.750 --> 07:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
it just isn't right
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
unless you're
 
07:16:02.310 --> 07:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
you are not just an expert in handling
 
07:16:04.948 --> 07:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
domesticated rabbits but you also have
 
07:16:07.990 --> 07:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
done a lot of wildlife rehab work with
 
07:16:10.390 --> 07:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
wild rabbits especially younger ones
 
07:16:13.030 --> 07:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
then your chances are so low of trying
 
07:16:15.430 --> 07:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
to raise them that could be argued it's
 
07:16:15.440 --> 07:16:16.868 align:start position:0%
to raise them that could be argued it's
inhumane

07:16:16.868 --> 07:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
inhumane
 
07:16:18.708 --> 07:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
they're one of the hardest wild mammals
 
07:16:21.190 --> 07:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
to raise and rehabilitate they over
 
07:16:23.350 --> 07:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
stress easily because of how much faster
 
07:16:25.670 --> 07:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
they grow than domestic rabbits and they
 
07:16:28.548 --> 07:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
also go downhill faster in health issues
 
07:16:30.390 --> 07:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
when they emerge
 
07:16:32.708 --> 07:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
should you import these animals should
 
07:16:34.948 --> 07:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
the import of these animals happen and
 
07:16:36.468 --> 07:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
it most likely will
 
07:16:38.788 --> 07:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that rabbit
 
07:16:42.070 --> 07:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
rabbit hemorrhagic disease rhd as it's
 
07:16:42.080 --> 07:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
rabbit hemorrhagic disease rhd as it's
known

07:16:43.030 --> 07:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
known
 
07:16:44.548 --> 07:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
also known
 
07:16:48.230 --> 07:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
as viral hemorrhagic disease vhd i know
 
07:16:51.990 --> 07:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've gone into a number of hd's today
 
07:16:54.150 --> 07:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's highly infectious in a lethal form
 
07:16:56.070 --> 07:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
of viral hepatitis
 
07:16:58.548 --> 07:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
that affects european rabbits some viral
 
07:17:01.590 --> 07:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
strains also affect hairs and cottontail
 
07:17:01.600 --> 07:17:03.350 align:start position:0%
strains also affect hairs and cottontail
rabbits

07:17:03.350 --> 07:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
rabbits
 
07:17:05.670 --> 07:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
mortality rates generally range from 70
 
07:17:07.510 --> 07:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
to 100 percent
 
07:17:08.948 --> 07:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
this disease has been found in
 
07:17:11.270 --> 07:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
southwestern in the southwestern united
 
07:17:14.070 --> 07:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
states and has made its way as far east
 
07:17:16.868 --> 07:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
as illinois it can affect pets as well
 
07:17:19.750 --> 07:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
as humans my source of this information
 
07:17:23.350 --> 07:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
is from a usda study which is ongoing
 
07:17:25.590 --> 07:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
in closing i urge the committee to vote
 
07:17:27.990 --> 07:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
otp in this bill it's not only the
 
07:17:30.390 --> 07:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
humane thing to do moreover it's the
 
07:17:32.390 --> 07:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
right thing to do i want to thank you
 
07:17:34.390 --> 07:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
very much and i'll take any questions
 
07:17:35.830 --> 07:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank representative any questions for
 
07:17:37.110 --> 07:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:17:38.310 --> 07:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
there being none thank you sir for
 
07:17:39.590 --> 07:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
coming for the fish and game committee
 
07:17:41.590 --> 07:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:17:44.548 --> 07:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
next up in support of the bill is linda
 
07:17:44.558 --> 07:17:45.670 align:start position:0%
next up in support of the bill is linda
dion

07:17:45.670 --> 07:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
dion
 
07:18:01.430 --> 07:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:03.430 --> 07:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman lang committee
 
07:18:07.030 --> 07:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
members um my name is linda dion
 
07:18:11.590 --> 07:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm here giving support for hb 1308
 
07:18:13.510 --> 07:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the first thing i want to say is
 
07:18:16.788 --> 07:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
this is not an anti-hunting bill
 
07:18:18.468 --> 07:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
as some opponents have said you'll hear
 
07:18:20.548 --> 07:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
some proponents say that today it is a
 
07:18:23.110 --> 07:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
conservation bill it
 
07:18:23.120 --> 07:18:23.910 align:start position:0%
conservation bill it
oh

07:18:23.910 --> 07:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:18:26.150 --> 07:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
who's that
 
07:18:30.070 --> 07:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:32.548 --> 07:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
anyway it's not an anti-hunting bill
 
07:18:34.548 --> 07:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
as some opponents will say it's a
 
07:18:36.310 --> 07:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
conservation bill
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's a bill to conserve the keystone
 
07:18:43.510 --> 07:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:43.520 --> 07:18:46.708 align:start position:0%
 
also

07:18:46.708 --> 07:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:48.310 --> 07:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
some some people may claim that there
 
07:18:50.390 --> 07:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
are plenty of snowshoe hairs out in the
 
07:18:50.400 --> 07:18:51.670 align:start position:0%
are plenty of snowshoe hairs out in the
wild

07:18:51.670 --> 07:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
wild
 
07:18:56.310 --> 07:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
but there's no data to back that up
 
07:18:59.270 --> 07:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
um but however signs point to the fact
 
07:19:01.270 --> 07:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
that snowshoe hairs are in trouble
 
07:19:02.708 --> 07:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
they're mainly in trouble because of our
 
07:19:04.948 --> 07:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
milder winters and for the
 
07:19:04.958 --> 07:19:06.468 align:start position:0%
milder winters and for the
characteristics

07:19:06.468 --> 07:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
07:19:08.310 --> 07:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
that they're famous for that we know and
 
07:19:08.320 --> 07:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
that they're famous for that we know and
love

07:19:09.430 --> 07:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
love
 
07:19:12.948 --> 07:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
the color change in the winter to white
 
07:19:15.030 --> 07:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
which doesn't help much when there's no
 
07:19:17.190 --> 07:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
snow out there and the big feet
 
07:19:19.990 --> 07:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
that act like a snowshoe that allows
 
07:19:22.390 --> 07:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
them to escape from prey
 
07:19:25.910 --> 07:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:29.270 --> 07:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
so anyway it's not an anti-hunty bill
 
07:19:31.110 --> 07:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how many are out there
 
07:19:32.628 --> 07:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
in the forest
 
07:19:35.750 --> 07:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
john levitis he's a wildlife biologist
 
07:19:37.990 --> 07:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
and a supporter of snowshoe hunting he
 
07:19:40.948 --> 07:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
supports the spill and he wrote
 
07:19:44.788 --> 07:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
in an article in northern woodlands an
 
07:19:47.670 --> 07:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
article entitled a white hair in a brown
 
07:19:47.680 --> 07:19:48.708 align:start position:0%
article entitled a white hair in a brown
forest

07:19:48.708 --> 07:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
forest
 
07:19:50.468 --> 07:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
i think that speaks for itself a white
 
07:19:53.590 --> 07:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
hair and a brown forest
 
07:19:55.270 --> 07:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
that means that the milder winters are
 
07:19:58.230 --> 07:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to affect this animal being white
 
07:20:01.590 --> 07:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
they lose their ability to camouflage
 
07:20:04.868 --> 07:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:07.510 --> 07:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that's john levitis
 
07:20:10.868 --> 07:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
a supporter of the bill who also hunts
 
07:20:13.110 --> 07:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hares
 
07:20:15.590 --> 07:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's also been habitat loss for the
 
07:20:17.270 --> 07:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
snowshoe here
 
07:20:18.708 --> 07:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire snowshoe hair
 
07:20:21.590 --> 07:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
assessment report in 2015 conducted by
 
07:20:25.270 --> 07:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:27.350 --> 07:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
07:20:29.910 --> 07:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
the snowshoe hail lost over 150 000
 
07:20:33.270 --> 07:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
acres of land between the years of 2001
 
07:20:36.868 --> 07:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:38.708 --> 07:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
and this is a trend that will continue
 
07:20:40.070 --> 07:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
07:20:42.948 --> 07:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
habitat loss is the problem
 
07:20:44.868 --> 07:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
for many of our wildlife because of
 
07:20:44.878 --> 07:20:48.548 align:start position:0%
for many of our wildlife because of
development

07:20:48.548 --> 07:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:52.548 --> 07:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:55.270 --> 07:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that was that was
 
07:20:57.750 --> 07:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
sure one more second just right okay
 
07:20:57.760 --> 07:20:58.948 align:start position:0%
sure one more second just right okay
um

07:20:58.948 --> 07:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:01.910 --> 07:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
another article was matters my hair and
 
07:21:04.310 --> 07:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
that was in the wildlife journal
 
07:21:07.190 --> 07:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
and it was um written by fish and game
 
07:21:07.200 --> 07:21:08.948 align:start position:0%
and it was um written by fish and game
biologists

07:21:08.948 --> 07:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
biologists
 
07:21:10.708 --> 07:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
and it
 
07:21:12.548 --> 07:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
well i was going to read this part okay
 
07:21:15.030 --> 07:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
it states no shoe his change color from
 
07:21:16.468 --> 07:21:16.478 align:start position:0%
brown to white in the beginning of the
 
07:21:18.868 --> 07:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
winter and back again to brown in the
 
07:21:21.190 --> 07:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
spring a transformation triggered by
 
07:21:23.430 --> 07:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
changing daylight recent
 
07:21:25.350 --> 07:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
research has shown that hairs are
 
07:21:25.360 --> 07:21:26.788 align:start position:0%
research has shown that hairs are
experiencing

07:21:26.788 --> 07:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
07:21:29.350 --> 07:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
more mismatched scenarios in which the
 
07:21:31.590 --> 07:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
snow melts early or comes late and the
 
07:21:33.430 --> 07:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
hairs are unable to blend into their
 
07:21:33.440 --> 07:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
hairs are unable to blend into their
surroundings

07:21:35.030 --> 07:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
surroundings
 
07:21:37.030 --> 07:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
interestingly hairs do not seem to
 
07:21:39.830 --> 07:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
recognize when am is matched
 
07:21:42.070 --> 07:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
which seems kind of cute to me can you
 
07:21:44.708 --> 07:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
just see the little white hair
 
07:21:47.030 --> 07:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
not realizing that the predator can see
 
07:21:49.110 --> 07:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
him he thinks he's camouflaged so linda
 
07:21:50.788 --> 07:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
you reached your time oh i have i'm

07:22:34.070 --> 07:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank you chairman
 
07:22:35.510 --> 07:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for giving
 
07:22:36.868 --> 07:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to speak my name is
 
07:22:39.430 --> 07:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
tony groshala and i live in milford
 
07:22:41.830 --> 07:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
i support bill 1308 because i oppose
 
07:22:44.070 --> 07:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
taking animals out of the wild for what
 
07:22:46.788 --> 07:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
amounts to a recreational endeavor
 
07:22:48.310 --> 07:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
this denies a living creature the
 
07:22:50.310 --> 07:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
comforts of its natural habitat and we
 
07:22:52.830 --> 07:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
should not be in the business of putting
 
07:22:56.070 --> 07:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
wildlife into captivity
 
07:22:57.990 --> 07:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
furthermore removing them from their
 
07:22:59.430 --> 07:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
natural habitat
 
07:23:00.788 --> 07:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
threatens the lives of the other
 
07:23:03.270 --> 07:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
creatures who depend on them among them
 
07:23:06.150 --> 07:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
bobcats red foxes great horned owls and
 
07:23:09.190 --> 07:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
the already threatened canadian links
 
07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
this does nothing more than disrupt the
 
07:23:13.030 --> 07:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
delicate food chain again for nothing
 
07:23:13.040 --> 07:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
delicate food chain again for nothing
more

07:23:13.910 --> 07:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:23:15.910 --> 07:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
than a recreational endeavor that
 
07:23:17.830 --> 07:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
exposes the hair to unjustified
 
07:23:17.840 --> 07:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
exposes the hair to unjustified
suffering

07:23:19.270 --> 07:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
07:23:19.280 --> 07:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
suffering
thank

07:24:16.708 --> 07:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman lang members of
 
07:24:19.350 --> 07:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is joan o'brien
 
07:24:22.708 --> 07:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm from amherst new hampshire i support
 
07:24:22.718 --> 07:24:24.548 align:start position:0%
i'm from amherst new hampshire i support
1308

07:24:24.548 --> 07:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
1308
 
07:24:27.190 --> 07:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are lots of good important reasons
 
07:24:28.708 --> 07:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
to support this bill but i'm just going
 
07:24:31.670 --> 07:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
to focus on one
 
07:24:33.750 --> 07:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that is that the beagle clubs are
 
07:24:36.150 --> 07:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
primarily interested in improving the
 
07:24:38.868 --> 07:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
breed with hunting being of a lesser
 
07:24:38.878 --> 07:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
breed with hunting being of a lesser
emphasis

07:24:41.750 --> 07:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:43.270 --> 07:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
when the hampshire fish and game first
 
07:24:45.030 --> 07:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
introduced the rule
 
07:24:46.468 --> 07:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
allowing the clubs to capture the
 
07:24:48.788 --> 07:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hares which was an exception to
 
07:24:50.628 --> 07:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
their directive that wildlife should not
 
07:24:53.030 --> 07:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
be taken out of the wild
 
07:24:56.230 --> 07:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
it was justified as needed to support
 
07:24:58.390 --> 07:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
the tradition continuing the tuition of
 
07:24:58.400 --> 07:24:59.830 align:start position:0%
the tradition continuing the tuition of
hunting

07:24:59.830 --> 07:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
07:25:02.070 --> 07:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
with dogs
 
07:25:04.468 --> 07:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
yet at the new hampshire beagle clubs
 
07:25:06.150 --> 07:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
the field trials in which the snowshoe
 
07:25:08.070 --> 07:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
hares are used center around maintaining
 
07:25:09.270 --> 07:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
and raising
 
07:25:11.030 --> 07:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
american kennel club standards for the
 
07:25:11.040 --> 07:25:12.548 align:start position:0%
american kennel club standards for the
beagles

07:25:12.548 --> 07:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
beagles
 
07:25:16.150 --> 07:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
from their field trial rules manual
 
07:25:17.750 --> 07:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
the holding this is a quote the holding
 
07:25:20.390 --> 07:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
of field trials at which purebred dogs
 
07:25:22.468 --> 07:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
may be run in competition
 
07:25:24.708 --> 07:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
has been found to be the best method by
 
07:25:26.788 --> 07:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
which the progress which has been made
 
07:25:29.750 --> 07:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
in breeding be shown
 
07:25:31.190 --> 07:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
while it's the beagle dog club's
 
07:25:33.990 --> 07:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
prerogative to pursue this goal it's not
 
07:25:36.070 --> 07:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
an appropriate use of new hampshire's
 
07:25:38.628 --> 07:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
wild hairs for this agenda
 
07:25:41.590 --> 07:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
consider this quote from a beagle owner
 
07:25:43.350 --> 07:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
i have a few young males that i hunt
 
07:25:45.590 --> 07:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
with i have never done any trialing but
 
07:25:47.590 --> 07:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
i thought about getting into it one of
 
07:25:49.350 --> 07:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
my males sticks out especially and i
 
07:25:51.750 --> 07:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
would someday like to have pups from him
 
07:25:53.430 --> 07:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think i would like to get some points
 
07:25:55.750 --> 07:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
on him before breeding him though
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is a person who is already hunting
 
07:25:59.110 --> 07:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
with his beagles
 
07:26:01.510 --> 07:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
he's looking to field trial competitions
 
07:26:03.430 --> 07:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
as a way to get his dog a ranking that
 
07:26:07.350 --> 07:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
could make him a a valuable stud dog
 
07:26:09.430 --> 07:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
the point is that it seems it's not the
 
07:26:10.948 --> 07:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
sport of hunting hairs that new
 
07:26:12.628 --> 07:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire fishing game is underwriting
 
07:26:14.230 --> 07:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
with the with the with the snowshoe
 
07:26:16.788 --> 07:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
hares but rather the sport of perfecting
 
07:26:19.350 --> 07:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
the beagle breed
 
07:26:20.468 --> 07:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
highlighting how important the
 
07:26:22.788 --> 07:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
competition aspect is the most shared
 
07:26:24.628 --> 07:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
photos on social media are pictures of
 
07:26:27.590 --> 07:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
winning dog lineups
 
07:26:29.750 --> 07:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that the akc earns
 
07:26:31.590 --> 07:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
revenue whenever dog owners compete and
 
07:26:33.350 --> 07:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
when breeders bring new dogs into the
 
07:26:33.360 --> 07:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
when breeders bring new dogs into the
world

07:26:34.310 --> 07:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
world
 
07:26:36.628 --> 07:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
according to the akc's 2018 annual
 
07:26:38.548 --> 07:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
report the most recent version available
 
07:26:41.310 --> 07:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
on the website the organization took in
 
07:26:44.388 --> 07:26:44.398 align:start position:0%
33.5 million in registration fees and
 
07:26:47.030 --> 07:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
11.7 million in event and recording fees
 
07:26:50.310 --> 07:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
last year i'm sorry in 2018.
 
07:26:52.070 --> 07:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
the akc does not earn money when
 
07:26:54.230 --> 07:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
somebody takes his two more seconds
 
07:26:56.070 --> 07:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
casey does not earn money when someone
 
07:26:57.510 --> 07:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
grabs his dog and goes out into the
 
07:26:59.990 --> 07:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
woods to hunt on his own
 
07:27:01.830 --> 07:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
once again that's the club's prerogative
 
07:27:03.590 --> 07:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
to hold these events
 
07:27:05.510 --> 07:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
um but it should not take place at the
 
07:27:07.990 --> 07:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
expense of our wild snowshoe hares
 
07:27:09.750 --> 07:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
07:27:11.830 --> 07:27:11.840 align:start position:0%

07:27:26.948 --> 07:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
next up in support of the bill is kurt
 
07:27:30.070 --> 07:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
ehrenberg from the humane society united
 
07:27:35.510 --> 07:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:41.030 --> 07:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:43.830 --> 07:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'll be extremely brief my name is kurt
 
07:27:45.910 --> 07:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
erenberg i'm the state director of the
 
07:27:49.110 --> 07:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
humane society of the united states
 
07:27:51.030 --> 07:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're here to support
 
07:27:53.190 --> 07:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:27:55.670 --> 07:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
i just say that the practice we're
 
07:27:57.990 --> 07:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
talking about here is barbaric it's
 
07:28:00.548 --> 07:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
cruel it's inhumane
 
07:28:04.230 --> 07:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
and it is totally unnecessary
 
07:28:06.708 --> 07:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
so we support the passage of this bill
 
07:28:08.468 --> 07:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:28:11.030 --> 07:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you kurt any questions for kurt
 
07:28:12.230 --> 07:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
07:28:13.350 --> 07:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of the fish and game
 
07:28:13.360 --> 07:28:15.270 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of the fish and game
committee

07:28:15.270 --> 07:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:28:18.548 --> 07:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
next up is robert kessler
 
07:28:30.388 --> 07:28:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:32.070 --> 07:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
chairman lang members of the committee
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony my
 
07:28:35.510 --> 07:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
name is robert kessling uh i'm speaking
 
07:28:37.750 --> 07:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of voices of wildlife in new
 
07:28:39.990 --> 07:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire in support of this bill 1308
 
07:28:41.750 --> 07:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
have some uh stuff to hand out to you
 
07:28:42.948 --> 07:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
i'll try to get some help because
 
07:28:44.388 --> 07:28:44.398 align:start position:0%
otherwise it'll be really awkward and
 
07:28:46.150 --> 07:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'll try to move quickly
 
07:28:46.160 --> 07:28:48.628 align:start position:0%
i'll try to move quickly
we

07:28:48.628 --> 07:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:51.190 --> 07:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
are recommending that you pass this bill
 
07:28:53.350 --> 07:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
that prohibits capture wild hair and
 
07:28:55.510 --> 07:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
relocation of them into captivity we
 
07:28:57.030 --> 07:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
believe this practice
 
07:28:58.628 --> 07:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
should be ended because it is
 
07:29:00.948 --> 07:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and unnatural it is
 
07:29:02.388 --> 07:29:02.398 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because beagles are
 
07:29:04.948 --> 07:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
instinctive instinctive scent hunters
 
07:29:06.628 --> 07:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
this is spoken to in an article on the
 
07:29:08.868 --> 07:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
handout recently published in the union
 
07:29:11.830 --> 07:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
leader by an experienced new hampshire
 
07:29:14.070 --> 07:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
hunter who says that beagles do not need
 
07:29:15.830 --> 07:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
to be trained to detect and pursue
 
07:29:18.070 --> 07:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
rabbits instinct alone drives these
 
07:29:18.080 --> 07:29:19.830 align:start position:0%
rabbits instinct alone drives these
skills

07:29:19.830 --> 07:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
skills
 
07:29:22.150 --> 07:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
this practice is also unnatural we agree
 
07:29:24.548 --> 07:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
with commissioners commissioner stoll's
 
07:29:24.558 --> 07:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
with commissioners commissioner stoll's
statement

07:29:25.510 --> 07:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
statement
 
07:29:28.868 --> 07:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
that a wild animal belongs in the wild
 
07:29:30.468 --> 07:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
the unnaturalness of this practice is
 
07:29:32.548 --> 07:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
also evident by the low propagation and
 
07:29:34.788 --> 07:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
survival rates that the clubs themselves
 
07:29:36.948 --> 07:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
report there's a
 
07:29:39.190 --> 07:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
a summary of a huge stack of paper of
 
07:29:41.030 --> 07:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
reports that we got through a request
 
07:29:42.548 --> 07:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
for information i
 
07:29:44.548 --> 07:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just speak to one piece of
 
07:29:45.510 --> 07:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
it first
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
the snowshoe here is a prolific reader
 
07:29:49.270 --> 07:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in the article already
 
07:29:51.430 --> 07:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
referenced matt as a march here
 
07:29:53.830 --> 07:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
the biologist that wrote that article
 
07:29:58.310 --> 07:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
estimates that hairs have three to five
 
07:30:00.150 --> 07:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
what do you call litters a year and
 
07:30:02.948 --> 07:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
produce six to eighteen labyrinths total
 
07:30:04.548 --> 07:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
each year
 
07:30:06.070 --> 07:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
however the propagation rates from the
 
07:30:07.590 --> 07:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
clubs themselves do not come anywhere
 
07:30:09.190 --> 07:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
near these numbers
 
07:30:10.788 --> 07:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
to take one for example i don't want to
 
07:30:11.830 --> 07:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
call them out i don't think they're
 
07:30:13.190 --> 07:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
doing anything in particular different
 
07:30:14.708 --> 07:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
from anybody else it just shows to show
 
07:30:15.910 --> 07:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
this practice is not good for the
 
07:30:15.920 --> 07:30:17.110 align:start position:0%
this practice is not good for the
species

07:30:17.110 --> 07:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
species
 
07:30:20.468 --> 07:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
they relocated in 2019 20 hairs to their
 
07:30:21.830 --> 07:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to their club
 
07:30:23.910 --> 07:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
four hairs were kept to be bred
 
07:30:26.708 --> 07:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
they reported having 10 babies as a
 
07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:32.548 --> 07:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
according to the estimates provided by
 
07:30:34.230 --> 07:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
the biologist the number should have
 
07:30:37.430 --> 07:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
been 24 or much much higher
 
07:30:39.750 --> 07:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
you can see in the uh
 
07:30:42.468 --> 07:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
the the results that even the survival
 
07:30:44.708 --> 07:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
rate is low this same club the following
 
07:30:44.718 --> 07:30:45.670 align:start position:0%
rate is low this same club the following
year

07:30:45.670 --> 07:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:30:48.230 --> 07:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
said that they saw maybe 16 hairs as
 
07:30:50.628 --> 07:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
they were out in the in their enclosures
 
07:30:52.468 --> 07:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
so where are these hairs going this is
 
07:30:53.990 --> 07:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that this practice does not
 
07:30:55.910 --> 07:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
even allow the sustaining of these
 
07:30:58.150 --> 07:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
populations uh even with hairs being
 
07:31:01.190 --> 07:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
brought in in intentional propagation
 
07:31:03.350 --> 07:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
so uh one point of procedure we did try
 
07:31:04.868 --> 07:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
to bring this to the commission 10
 
07:31:06.310 --> 07:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
seconds left thank you we tried to bring
 
07:31:07.510 --> 07:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
it to the commission j.l carr
 
07:31:08.868 --> 07:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
recommended we bring it here because
 
07:31:11.030 --> 07:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
that went nowhere uh finally i'd like to
 
07:31:13.430 --> 07:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
point out that opponents of this bill
 
07:31:15.590 --> 07:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
will argue that we are trying to end a
 
07:31:17.510 --> 07:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
time-honored tradition and with due
 
07:31:20.230 --> 07:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
respect to tradition we disagree
 
07:31:22.628 --> 07:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
this will not end running beagles this
 
07:31:25.110 --> 07:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
will not end uh hunting snowshoe hare
 
07:31:26.948 --> 07:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
however it will end the practice of
 
07:31:28.788 --> 07:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
capturing wild animals putting them in
 
07:31:30.070 --> 07:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
captivity thank you this is
 
07:31:32.070 --> 07:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about the wild here not
 
07:31:33.830 --> 07:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
the beakle clubs thank you very much
 
07:31:35.030 --> 07:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
07:31:35.040 --> 07:31:36.788 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

07:31:36.788 --> 07:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:31:39.590 --> 07:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative laflamme thank you mr
 
07:31:39.600 --> 07:31:40.628 align:start position:0%
representative laflamme thank you mr
chairman

chairman
 
07:31:43.030 --> 07:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
mr kinsley you mentioned a low survival
 
07:31:43.040 --> 07:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
mr kinsley you mentioned a low survival
rate

07:31:43.830 --> 07:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
rate
 
07:31:46.628 --> 07:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
of the hairs that are in these do you
 
07:31:48.948 --> 07:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
know if the low survival rate is due to
 
07:31:51.430 --> 07:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
sickness disease or predation
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you we
 
07:31:55.750 --> 07:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we took a look at the reports
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
from the hair uh the beagle clubs
 
07:32:01.510 --> 07:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
there was not much in the way of uh you
 
07:32:04.548 --> 07:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
know some clubs report losing five maybe
 
07:32:07.110 --> 07:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
ten hairs uh to different reasons there
 
07:32:09.030 --> 07:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
was nothing that said uh anything about
 
07:32:11.910 --> 07:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh disease in there but uh predation is
 
07:32:15.030 --> 07:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned uh didn't seem there was no
 
07:32:16.628 --> 07:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
numbers to
 
07:32:18.548 --> 07:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
that stand out to me as significant
 
07:32:18.558 --> 07:32:20.948 align:start position:0%
that stand out to me as significant
there

07:32:20.948 --> 07:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:22.948 --> 07:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
07:32:24.310 --> 07:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
seeing done thank you very much sir for
 
07:32:26.788 --> 07:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
your testimony if you want to leave your
 
07:32:28.708 --> 07:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
box over by representative horrigan we
 
07:32:29.990 --> 07:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
can make sure it gets passed out to the
 
07:32:30.000 --> 07:32:32.948 align:start position:0%
can make sure it gets passed out to the
committee

07:32:32.948 --> 07:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:36.150 --> 07:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
next up is weldon bosworth again from

07:32:56.070 --> 07:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
good evening i think we're at almost
 
07:32:57.750 --> 07:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
evening now
 
07:32:59.270 --> 07:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
07:33:01.750 --> 07:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony i am
 
07:33:04.070 --> 07:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
here speaking on behalf of dog owners of
 
07:33:05.990 --> 07:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
the granite state who monitors
 
07:33:09.430 --> 07:33:09.440 align:start position:0%

rights

07:33:10.868 --> 07:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
rights
 
07:33:13.830 --> 07:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
we have we were founded back in 1991 so
 
07:33:16.868 --> 07:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
we have been around for a while
 
07:33:21.190 --> 07:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
and we are in opposition of hb 1308 we
 
07:33:23.350 --> 07:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's a stepping stone to ending
 
07:33:25.270 --> 07:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
all training of tracking and hunting
 
07:33:28.310 --> 07:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
dogs in new hampshire
 
07:33:29.670 --> 07:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that i did want to
 
07:33:31.750 --> 07:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
clarify from some of the testimony
 
07:33:33.590 --> 07:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard so far
 
07:33:33.600 --> 07:33:34.548 align:start position:0%
you've heard so far
the

07:33:34.548 --> 07:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:33:37.510 --> 07:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
beagle is a small sturdy hard-working
 
07:33:39.030 --> 07:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
scent hound
 
07:33:41.350 --> 07:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
their ability is focused on following
 
07:33:41.360 --> 07:33:42.388 align:start position:0%
their ability is focused on following
ascent

07:33:42.388 --> 07:33:42.398 align:start position:0%
ascent
 
07:33:45.350 --> 07:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
not capturing or killing game
 
07:33:47.830 --> 07:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
so we've heard things words such as
 
07:33:50.310 --> 07:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
barbaric and about the death of the
 
07:33:52.948 --> 07:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare and that is not the role
 
07:33:55.670 --> 07:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
of a beagle in this sport
 
07:33:57.830 --> 07:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that bill has been driven by
 
07:34:01.670 --> 07:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:03.910 --> 07:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
management of rabbits and hair used for
 
07:34:06.548 --> 07:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
beagle training so i'd like to touch on
 
07:34:09.110 --> 07:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
a few of those points
 
07:34:11.110 --> 07:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
i have testimony for you that i'll hand
 
07:34:13.110 --> 07:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
out if someone is
 
07:34:15.750 --> 07:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
able to pass that around
 
07:34:17.510 --> 07:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
that includes some q and a's that i'm
 
07:34:18.948 --> 07:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
going to cover for you
 
07:34:21.750 --> 07:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
so how are the hair captured they are
 
07:34:24.230 --> 07:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
captured or taken in a large catch cage
 
07:34:26.468 --> 07:34:26.478 align:start position:0%
or live trap similar to the types of
 
07:34:28.788 --> 07:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
traps used for catching stray animals
 
07:34:30.788 --> 07:34:30.798 align:start position:0%
when the trap is triggered a gravity or
 
07:34:32.788 --> 07:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
spring driven door closes keeping the
 
07:34:35.350 --> 07:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
animal inside of the cage such traps
 
07:34:37.830 --> 07:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
cause no injury to the animal trapping
 
07:34:40.230 --> 07:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
is a licensed regulated activity with
 
07:34:42.468 --> 07:34:42.478 align:start position:0%
each beagle club requiring a license and
 
07:34:42.478 --> 07:34:44.548 align:start position:0%
each beagle club requiring a license and
oversight

07:34:44.548 --> 07:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
07:34:47.270 --> 07:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
how are the hair kept in captivity when
 
07:34:49.270 --> 07:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
you do get the documentation that's
 
07:34:51.350 --> 07:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
going around there's a nice picture of
 
07:34:53.430 --> 07:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
one of the new hampshire hair enclosures
 
07:34:56.868 --> 07:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
and habitat you will see that it is
 
07:34:59.590 --> 07:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
basically a large area of woods
 
07:35:03.190 --> 07:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
30 seconds okay we're talking up to 55
 
07:35:05.750 --> 07:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
acres or larger of natural habitat and
 
07:35:07.990 --> 07:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
you can find more information
 
07:35:11.110 --> 07:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
we also heard talks about being able to
 
07:35:13.270 --> 07:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
just hunt in the wild without training
 
07:35:16.468 --> 07:35:16.478 align:start position:0%
on a designated area they run on beagles
 
07:35:18.388 --> 07:35:18.398 align:start position:0%
run on fenced acreage because their
 
07:35:20.230 --> 07:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
ascent hound an inexperienced dog may
 
07:35:22.310 --> 07:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
run a stray on scent trails from other
 
07:35:22.320 --> 07:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
run a stray on scent trails from other
game

07:35:23.270 --> 07:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
game
 
07:35:26.150 --> 07:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that would be difficult to do proper
 
07:35:26.160 --> 07:35:27.430 align:start position:0%
so that would be difficult to do proper
training

07:35:27.430 --> 07:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
training
 
07:35:29.430 --> 07:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
if you would please take a look at why
 
07:35:31.350 --> 07:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
they also cannot use domesticated
 
07:35:33.590 --> 07:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
rabbits and need to use the wild rabbits
 
07:35:35.830 --> 07:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's in there as well lastly two quick
 
07:35:35.840 --> 07:35:37.350 align:start position:0%
that's in there as well lastly two quick
points

07:35:37.350 --> 07:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
points
 
07:35:39.670 --> 07:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
i personally have a beagle he isn't a
 
07:35:42.388 --> 07:35:42.398 align:start position:0%
hunting beagle and i just wanted to let
 
07:35:45.830 --> 07:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
everyone know that he could not probably
 
07:35:48.150 --> 07:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
find a snowshoe hare out in the wild
 
07:35:50.468 --> 07:35:50.478 align:start position:0%
without proper training he has the
 
07:35:52.708 --> 07:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
instincts to hunt but he would probably
 
07:35:54.628 --> 07:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
superior and i would never see him again
 
07:35:57.750 --> 07:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:59.350 --> 07:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
07:36:01.030 --> 07:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
last piece real quick
 
07:36:03.670 --> 07:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
hunters versus preservation breeders
 
07:36:05.590 --> 07:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard things about
 
07:36:07.990 --> 07:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
being in it for the money wanting to be
 
07:36:10.310 --> 07:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
at the westminster dog show breed their
 
07:36:10.320 --> 07:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
at the westminster dog show breed their
dogs

07:36:11.270 --> 07:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
07:36:12.948 --> 07:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
there is a bit of a difference there
 
07:36:15.030 --> 07:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
between the preservation breeders who
 
07:36:17.190 --> 07:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily hunting and i just
 
07:36:19.670 --> 07:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it isn't being
 
07:36:21.190 --> 07:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
confused that that's why they're out
 
07:36:22.868 --> 07:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
there hunting to try and breed their
 
07:36:24.948 --> 07:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
dogs thank you for your testimony any
 
07:36:26.948 --> 07:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
questions from miss ferrari
 
07:36:30.150 --> 07:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:33.030 --> 07:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
07:36:35.430 --> 07:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i i hear that you're saying that the
 
07:36:37.270 --> 07:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
the hairs are necessary for training the
 
07:36:37.280 --> 07:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
the hairs are necessary for training the
dogs

07:36:38.230 --> 07:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
07:36:39.670 --> 07:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i didn't hear anything in your
 
07:36:41.510 --> 07:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that is getting at this main
 
07:36:43.430 --> 07:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
question and that is
 
07:36:45.590 --> 07:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
i would like a pet raccoon but i have
 
07:36:47.110 --> 07:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
been told my whole life i'm not allowed
 
07:36:48.708 --> 07:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
to go into the woods and catch a raccoon
 
07:36:49.990 --> 07:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and bring it home
 
07:36:52.388 --> 07:36:52.398 align:start position:0%
i would really like one so why is it
 
07:36:53.590 --> 07:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
that you all
 
07:36:56.230 --> 07:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
get to capture rabbits
 
07:36:57.990 --> 07:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
because you enjoy doing something with
 
07:37:01.270 --> 07:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
them but i can't take a pet raccoon home
 
07:37:03.190 --> 07:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
because i would enjoy it
 
07:37:05.350 --> 07:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question would you be
 
07:37:08.708 --> 07:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
maintaining that raccoon on 55 acres of
 
07:37:10.948 --> 07:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
land for his habitat
 
07:37:13.830 --> 07:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
because that is how we manage the hair
 
07:37:16.230 --> 07:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
that are kept in captivity they also
 
07:37:19.110 --> 07:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
have monitored feeding stations that
 
07:37:20.788 --> 07:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the food that
 
07:37:23.110 --> 07:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
they need and with it being a fenced in
 
07:37:24.948 --> 07:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
area they're actually safer from
 
07:37:27.430 --> 07:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
predators than out in the wild so it's a
 
07:37:29.590 --> 07:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
very nice situation that they get to be
 
07:37:29.600 --> 07:37:31.110 align:start position:0%
very nice situation that they get to be
in

07:37:31.110 --> 07:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:37:32.468 --> 07:37:32.478 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
07:37:32.478 --> 07:37:34.628 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
committee

07:37:34.628 --> 07:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:37:35.830 --> 07:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're being done thank you angela
 
07:37:37.510 --> 07:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:37:40.230 --> 07:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
next up is dan doubleday of northfield
 
07:37:55.350 --> 07:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:57.510 --> 07:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot of scientific
 
07:37:57.520 --> 07:37:58.708 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot of scientific
information

07:37:58.708 --> 07:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:38:02.150 --> 07:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
i've run beagles my entire life i hit my
 
07:38:05.430 --> 07:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
first beagle when i was eight years old
 
07:38:05.440 --> 07:38:06.388 align:start position:0%
first beagle when i was eight years old
um

07:38:06.388 --> 07:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:07.830 --> 07:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
when i was eight years old you could
 
07:38:09.270 --> 07:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
turn a dog loose anywhere in the
 
07:38:11.590 --> 07:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state and train or
 
07:38:13.190 --> 07:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
train a dog
 
07:38:15.030 --> 07:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
i recently joined the beagle club
 
07:38:15.040 --> 07:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
i recently joined the beagle club
because

07:38:16.070 --> 07:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:38:18.948 --> 07:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
there are no rabbits much south of
 
07:38:21.510 --> 07:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
franconia notch there's a very large
 
07:38:25.350 --> 07:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:27.750 --> 07:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'd go north of the notch as often as i
 
07:38:27.760 --> 07:38:28.868 align:start position:0%
i'd go north of the notch as often as i
can

07:38:28.868 --> 07:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
can
 
07:38:31.190 --> 07:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
i try to keep my dogs in shape
 
07:38:33.670 --> 07:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
we run them at the club
 
07:38:36.150 --> 07:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
the average speed of my dogs is under
 
07:38:37.910 --> 07:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
two miles an hour
 
07:38:40.310 --> 07:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
so there's no way that my dogs will ever
 
07:38:42.310 --> 07:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
catch a rabbit
 
07:38:45.030 --> 07:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
but i need to i i want to keep them
 
07:38:47.510 --> 07:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
exercised in november i had the
 
07:38:51.110 --> 07:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:53.350 --> 07:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
i was had a six six and a half year old
 
07:38:53.360 --> 07:38:54.388 align:start position:0%
i was had a six six and a half year old
dog

07:38:54.388 --> 07:38:54.398 align:start position:0%
dog
 
07:38:56.388 --> 07:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
died running
 
07:38:56.398 --> 07:38:57.830 align:start position:0%
died running
rabbits

07:38:57.830 --> 07:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
rabbits
 
07:38:57.840 --> 07:38:58.948 align:start position:0%
rabbits
and

07:38:58.948 --> 07:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:39:00.548 --> 07:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
you know i wish they were running more
 
07:39:02.708 --> 07:39:02.718 align:start position:0%
this this summer to keep him in better
 
07:39:02.718 --> 07:39:04.548 align:start position:0%
this this summer to keep him in better
shape

07:39:04.548 --> 07:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
shape
 
07:39:08.230 --> 07:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
um it could have been a
 
07:39:10.708 --> 07:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
lyme carditis is what the vet seemed to
 
07:39:12.830 --> 07:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
07:39:12.840 --> 07:39:14.388 align:start position:0%
think it was
but

07:39:14.388 --> 07:39:14.398 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:39:17.830 --> 07:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i enjoy the dogs it's hard for me
 
07:39:20.310 --> 07:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
not to tear up even talking
 
07:39:20.320 --> 07:39:21.830 align:start position:0%
not to tear up even talking
about

07:39:21.830 --> 07:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:39:23.990 --> 07:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
this particular dog but
 
07:39:26.070 --> 07:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's an event that i
 
07:39:28.548 --> 07:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
really enjoy
 
07:39:31.670 --> 07:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it allows me not very i don't have
 
07:39:32.868 --> 07:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
to travel
 
07:39:36.388 --> 07:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles to run my dogs
 
07:39:36.398 --> 07:39:37.350 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles to run my dogs
um

07:39:37.350 --> 07:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:39:38.948 --> 07:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is you know we hear
 
07:39:40.388 --> 07:39:40.398 align:start position:0%
a lot about
 
07:39:44.948 --> 07:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
wild animals in captivity
 
07:39:47.670 --> 07:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's clark's trading post
 
07:39:48.948 --> 07:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
they've got
 
07:39:48.958 --> 07:39:50.150 align:start position:0%
they've got
bear

07:39:50.150 --> 07:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
bear
 
07:39:50.160 --> 07:39:51.750 align:start position:0%
bear
there

07:39:51.750 --> 07:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:39:53.830 --> 07:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly only for commercial
 
07:39:53.840 --> 07:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly only for commercial
purposes

07:39:55.670 --> 07:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
07:39:55.680 --> 07:39:56.868 align:start position:0%
purposes
so

07:39:56.868 --> 07:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:39:59.910 --> 07:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i i oppose this bill because i
 
07:40:01.670 --> 07:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's the first step
 
07:40:03.190 --> 07:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
in stopping
 
07:40:06.310 --> 07:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
running dogs with the
 
07:40:08.628 --> 07:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
on on snowshoe hair
 
07:40:11.350 --> 07:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
and they also
 
07:40:13.270 --> 07:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
are not
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
not all beagles are created equal
 
07:40:18.948 --> 07:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
they don't all just show them a rabbit
 
07:40:21.750 --> 07:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and they run 10 seconds it takes it
 
07:40:23.510 --> 07:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time and a lot of
 
07:40:23.520 --> 07:40:24.708 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time and a lot of
practice

07:40:24.708 --> 07:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
practice
 
07:40:25.910 --> 07:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
07:40:28.628 --> 07:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i am not a field trialer either i'm
 
07:40:30.788 --> 07:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
simply a rabbit hunter
 
07:40:32.230 --> 07:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr
 
07:40:33.910 --> 07:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
doubleday for your testimony does
 
07:40:36.788 --> 07:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for mr double a
 
07:40:38.150 --> 07:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir for
 
07:40:39.270 --> 07:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony in front of the fish and
 
07:40:40.628 --> 07:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
game commission
 
07:40:44.230 --> 07:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
next up is susan price she is one of our
 
07:40:45.670 --> 07:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
fish and game commissioners however
 
07:40:47.510 --> 07:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
she's here speaking on her own behalf
 
07:40:50.830 --> 07:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:53.030 --> 07:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
commission and a half minutes ma'am
 
07:40:54.548 --> 07:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:40:54.558 --> 07:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

07:40:56.070 --> 07:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:58.150 --> 07:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that made the statement
 
07:41:01.190 --> 07:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
earlier that uh dogs know how to hunt
 
07:41:02.708 --> 07:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
07:41:04.868 --> 07:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
but you have to be able to train your
 
07:41:07.110 --> 07:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
dog to hunt
 
07:41:09.910 --> 07:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise such as the woman from
 
07:41:12.310 --> 07:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
the green estate dog
 
07:41:13.830 --> 07:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
they will just run around in the woods
 
07:41:16.150 --> 07:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
you'll lose your dog
 
07:41:19.110 --> 07:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
so you need live game and in this case
 
07:41:21.670 --> 07:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare as the gentleman before me
 
07:41:21.680 --> 07:41:22.868 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare as the gentleman before me
attested

07:41:22.868 --> 07:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
attested
 
07:41:26.468 --> 07:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
i'm a bird hunter i need to have my dog
 
07:41:28.388 --> 07:41:28.398 align:start position:0%
safely trained
 
07:41:31.110 --> 07:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
the prey instinct in these hunting dogs
 
07:41:32.230 --> 07:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
is so
 
07:41:32.240 --> 07:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
is so
strong

07:41:33.350 --> 07:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
strong
 
07:41:35.910 --> 07:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
that if you do not train them on live
 
07:41:35.920 --> 07:41:37.270 align:start position:0%
that if you do not train them on live
game

07:41:37.270 --> 07:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
game
 
07:41:39.750 --> 07:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
you will end up shooting your dog you
 
07:41:42.548 --> 07:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
have to be able to control your dog when
 
07:41:45.750 --> 07:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
it has this prey instinct and i think
 
07:41:48.548 --> 07:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
there's this false narrative that this
 
07:41:51.750 --> 07:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
can somehow just be done magically
 
07:41:53.510 --> 07:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are surprised that these
 
07:41:55.350 --> 07:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
dogs you don't train a hunting dog on
 
07:41:55.360 --> 07:41:56.310 align:start position:0%
dogs you don't train a hunting dog on
treats

07:41:56.310 --> 07:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
treats
 
07:41:59.110 --> 07:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
i've never used a treat to train my
 
07:42:01.670 --> 07:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
honey dog i have a relationship with my
 
07:42:03.110 --> 07:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
hunting dog
 
07:42:05.750 --> 07:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
she wants to please me she wants to find
 
07:42:07.910 --> 07:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
upland game birds for me
 
07:42:09.910 --> 07:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
i had a beagle dog when i grew up as a
 
07:42:12.468 --> 07:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
little girl my dad did not properly
 
07:42:14.468 --> 07:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
train the dog
 
07:42:17.030 --> 07:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
it got shot by accident
 
07:42:18.388 --> 07:42:18.398 align:start position:0%
he told the dog
 
07:42:20.948 --> 07:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
to stop the dog kept running and he shot
 
07:42:23.670 --> 07:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
the dog by accident the dog lived
 
07:42:23.680 --> 07:42:24.868 align:start position:0%
the dog by accident the dog lived
but

07:42:24.868 --> 07:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:42:27.350 --> 07:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
the point is that there is this repeated
 
07:42:29.590 --> 07:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
false narrative that
 
07:42:32.628 --> 07:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs don't need to be trained
 
07:42:35.270 --> 07:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
when they have to be trained for safety
 
07:42:37.750 --> 07:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
no other reason than safety second
 
07:42:40.230 --> 07:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
secondarily for the success of the hunt
 
07:42:43.110 --> 07:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
but the primary reason i use live game
 
07:42:46.868 --> 07:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
birds on my dog when she was younger was
 
07:42:50.150 --> 07:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
to produce a dog that would go steady to
 
07:42:53.750 --> 07:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
wing and shot and not jump after a bird
 
07:42:56.788 --> 07:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
and face mortality thank you
 
07:42:59.110 --> 07:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for
 
07:43:02.150 --> 07:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner price or mrs price
 
07:43:02.160 --> 07:43:04.150 align:start position:0%
commissioner price or mrs price
yes

07:43:04.150 --> 07:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:43:05.510 --> 07:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
07:43:07.910 --> 07:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
07:43:10.150 --> 07:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
i was actually concerned when i heard
 
07:43:12.230 --> 07:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that somebody had
 
07:43:13.590 --> 07:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
said that
 
07:43:15.670 --> 07:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
bird dogs are never trained on live
 
07:43:17.910 --> 07:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
birds that are captured or
 
07:43:20.230 --> 07:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
kept in pens because i know for a fact
 
07:43:22.948 --> 07:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
i've seen some bird dogs
 
07:43:25.030 --> 07:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
that are trained on caged pheasant and
 
07:43:27.510 --> 07:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
caged gross i just heard you also
 
07:43:29.670 --> 07:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
explain that you did train on live birds
 
07:43:31.430 --> 07:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
that is something that's done just much
 
07:43:33.110 --> 07:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
like the beagles are trained on hairs is
 
07:43:34.310 --> 07:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
it not
 
07:43:35.830 --> 07:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
07:43:38.150 --> 07:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
pigeons are actually captured
 
07:43:40.548 --> 07:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
to minimize the training costs
 
07:43:40.558 --> 07:43:41.670 align:start position:0%
to minimize the training costs
um

07:43:41.670 --> 07:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:41.680 --> 07:43:42.628 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:43:42.628 --> 07:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:43:44.548 --> 07:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
pigeons are actually captured by some
 
07:43:46.310 --> 07:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
trainers in some states they're allowed
 
07:43:49.430 --> 07:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
to to capture pigeons and use those um
 
07:43:51.910 --> 07:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
they train them to come back
 
07:43:53.110 --> 07:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
like any further questions from the
 
07:43:57.190 --> 07:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:59.030 --> 07:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
um first of all i guess i want to
 
07:44:01.510 --> 07:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
welcome the honorable susan price back
 
07:44:03.270 --> 07:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
she's a former state rep from uh from
 
07:44:06.628 --> 07:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
barrington if i recall correctly so
 
07:44:09.350 --> 07:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
and also that's survey this is somewhat
 
07:44:11.750 --> 07:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe i grew up with two
 
07:44:13.030 --> 07:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
beagles i don't know whether they're
 
07:44:14.948 --> 07:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
properly trained although they were
 
07:44:17.350 --> 07:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
trained fairly well to survive on
 
07:44:19.590 --> 07:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
east 79th street in new york city so
 
07:44:19.600 --> 07:44:21.190 align:start position:0%
east 79th street in new york city so
like

07:44:21.190 --> 07:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:44:23.830 --> 07:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
so would you um
 
07:44:25.350 --> 07:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i just thought i'd uh just thought
 
07:44:26.948 --> 07:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
i'd you probably i guess you probably
 
07:44:28.708 --> 07:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't believe that but just so they
 
07:44:30.548 --> 07:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
would have been totally hopeless if they
 
07:44:32.310 --> 07:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
saw a snowshoe here i'm pretty sure they
 
07:44:33.830 --> 07:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
would have run the opposite direction
 
07:44:35.030 --> 07:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
like so
 
07:44:36.310 --> 07:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horgan i'm not
 
07:44:37.830 --> 07:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
sure there's a question there
 
07:44:40.070 --> 07:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
but it is true i was a representative
 
07:44:42.628 --> 07:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
from strafford county but i retired to
 
07:44:44.230 --> 07:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
good old mountain borough
 
07:44:46.310 --> 07:44:46.320 align:start position:0%

07:44:48.070 --> 07:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
or the commissioner being then thank you
 
07:44:49.590 --> 07:44:49.600 align:start position:0%

but i am here to testify as a member of
 
07:45:11.830 --> 07:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
the public
 
07:45:11.840 --> 07:45:12.628 align:start position:0%
the public
um

07:45:12.628 --> 07:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:15.350 --> 07:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
in my private life i work in the pet
 
07:45:18.150 --> 07:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
industry um primarily uh as a managing
 
07:45:19.830 --> 07:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
partner of northwoods collective which
 
07:45:23.510 --> 07:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
is engaged in this creative agency um
 
07:45:25.270 --> 07:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs is a cornerstone of our
 
07:45:27.030 --> 07:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
business we own hunting dog confidential
 
07:45:28.948 --> 07:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
magazine which entails a gentleman named
 
07:45:30.150 --> 07:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
craig kaushik which is one of the
 
07:45:32.468 --> 07:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
foremost authorities in the world for
 
07:45:35.110 --> 07:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
historians on hunting dogs
 
07:45:37.830 --> 07:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
as we've heard everybody's debated many
 
07:45:39.510 --> 07:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
things around
 
07:45:42.070 --> 07:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
the rabbit itself i think that
 
07:45:43.430 --> 07:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state has went out of its way to
 
07:45:45.270 --> 07:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that the health of the hairs
 
07:45:47.910 --> 07:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that the hairs that are uh
 
07:45:50.388 --> 07:45:50.398 align:start position:0%
being used in these capacities are being
 
07:45:52.868 --> 07:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
satisfied and i know they're the full
 
07:45:54.468 --> 07:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
standard of random checks and whatnot
 
07:45:55.750 --> 07:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
what i want to speak to is the actual
 
07:45:59.190 --> 07:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
history i own a german i'm sorry i own a
 
07:46:01.590 --> 07:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
wire here pointing griffon
 
07:46:03.430 --> 07:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you turn back the clock less than 60
 
07:46:05.750 --> 07:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
years ago the breed was almost extinct
 
07:46:07.830 --> 07:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
most dogs that we know today were almost
 
07:46:10.150 --> 07:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
extinct after the second world war which
 
07:46:12.070 --> 07:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
did almost eliminate most breeds there
 
07:46:14.548 --> 07:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
are extinct dog breeds that we know of
 
07:46:16.388 --> 07:46:16.398 align:start position:0%
that are no longer here
 
07:46:19.350 --> 07:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
this bill further passed the care of the
 
07:46:22.310 --> 07:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
hair which has been satisfied is about
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
responsible breeding practices in the
 
07:46:26.948 --> 07:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and we as a state
 
07:46:29.430 --> 07:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
should make sure that we're abiding by
 
07:46:31.110 --> 07:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
responsible and ethical breeding
 
07:46:33.750 --> 07:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
practices to pass on tradition that
 
07:46:35.510 --> 07:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
people have done
 
07:46:37.830 --> 07:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
for literally hundreds of years in this
 
07:46:40.468 --> 07:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
case i feel like we're targeting a
 
07:46:43.430 --> 07:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable aspect of our of our state
 
07:46:45.830 --> 07:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
that isn't a minor that isn't a majority
 
07:46:48.150 --> 07:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
that is a minority and saying just
 
07:46:50.548 --> 07:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
because we don't necessarily like the
 
07:46:53.670 --> 07:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
way you do your heritage and the
 
07:46:55.590 --> 07:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
importance of the beagle and what the
 
07:46:58.628 --> 07:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
beagle means to our human history as
 
07:47:01.030 --> 07:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
hunters is being negated through the
 
07:47:01.040 --> 07:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
hunters is being negated through the
process

07:47:02.150 --> 07:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:47:03.910 --> 07:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:47:05.830 --> 07:47:05.840 align:start position:0%

seeing them thank you very much sir
 
07:47:12.868 --> 07:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
next up is dan bergeron on the hampshire
 
07:47:21.910 --> 07:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:23.110 --> 07:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i think at this point i've
 
07:47:24.548 --> 07:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
been up here more than colonel jordan
 
07:47:25.350 --> 07:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering when i get the
 
07:47:28.548 --> 07:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
distinguished uh category in about 20
 
07:47:28.558 --> 07:47:30.948 align:start position:0%
distinguished uh category in about 20
years

07:47:30.948 --> 07:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:30.958 --> 07:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:47:31.990 --> 07:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:47:33.670 --> 07:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you dan bergeron chief of the
 
07:47:35.030 --> 07:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife physician
 
07:47:37.670 --> 07:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here to represent the department in
 
07:47:39.030 --> 07:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the commission in opposition of this
 
07:47:39.040 --> 07:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
the commission in opposition of this
bill

07:47:39.830 --> 07:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:47:42.150 --> 07:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:47:42.160 --> 07:47:42.868 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:47:42.868 --> 07:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:47:45.430 --> 07:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
so our administrative rules part fis
 
07:47:45.440 --> 07:47:48.070 align:start position:0%
so our administrative rules part fis
806.05

07:47:48.070 --> 07:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
806.05
 
07:47:49.990 --> 07:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
are what regulate the live capture of
 
07:47:51.830 --> 07:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare
 
07:47:55.350 --> 07:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
these these rules were developed um
 
07:47:58.708 --> 07:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
to ensure the safety of the the um of
 
07:48:00.150 --> 07:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
the snowshoe hare population of the
 
07:48:02.388 --> 07:48:02.398 align:start position:0%
state and with the
 
07:48:03.990 --> 07:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
safety and
 
07:48:05.590 --> 07:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
condition of the hairs that are trapped
 
07:48:06.708 --> 07:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
07:48:08.868 --> 07:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to go over
 
07:48:10.868 --> 07:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
some of the regulations
 
07:48:12.468 --> 07:48:12.478 align:start position:0%
around this practice because it is
 
07:48:15.990 --> 07:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:18.070 --> 07:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
so under these current rules
 
07:48:20.388 --> 07:48:20.398 align:start position:0%
they can snowshoe hair can only be live
 
07:48:22.948 --> 07:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
captured um by licensed trappers who are
 
07:48:25.590 --> 07:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
members of a designated club
 
07:48:27.910 --> 07:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
and there's there's only five clubs in
 
07:48:29.510 --> 07:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
the state that are
 
07:48:31.030 --> 07:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
permitted to do this
 
07:48:33.350 --> 07:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
um clubs must also hold a valid
 
07:48:35.590 --> 07:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
propagation permit which is also issued
 
07:48:37.510 --> 07:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
by the department and they must follow
 
07:48:39.190 --> 07:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
all the requirements that are associated
 
07:48:43.510 --> 07:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:46.070 --> 07:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
trapping can only take place
 
07:48:47.750 --> 07:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
during the open season for hunting
 
07:48:49.990 --> 07:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare and it can only take place
 
07:48:52.150 --> 07:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
on private property with lit and written
 
07:48:54.070 --> 07:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
landowner permission
 
07:48:55.670 --> 07:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've set restrictions on the type of
 
07:48:58.150 --> 07:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
traps that must be used
 
07:49:00.310 --> 07:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
how frequently the traps must be set how
 
07:49:03.270 --> 07:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
much food must be placed in the traps
 
07:49:05.190 --> 07:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that all traps must have a
 
07:49:07.990 --> 07:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
weatherproof top
 
07:49:11.030 --> 07:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
so there are no more than 20 hair that
 
07:49:13.910 --> 07:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
can be trapped per club per year so that
 
07:49:15.830 --> 07:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
would equate to a maximum that can be
 
07:49:19.590 --> 07:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
trapped per year of 100 hair statewide
 
07:49:21.910 --> 07:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've also taken further precautions in
 
07:49:23.190 --> 07:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state where
 
07:49:24.868 --> 07:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
there is less abundant snowshoe hair
 
07:49:24.878 --> 07:49:26.230 align:start position:0%
there is less abundant snowshoe hair
habitat

07:49:26.230 --> 07:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
habitat
 
07:49:27.830 --> 07:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
some of our wildlife management units
 
07:49:29.430 --> 07:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
you cannot capture
 
07:49:31.510 --> 07:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
more than 10 hair from those areas where
 
07:49:33.750 --> 07:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
habitat is not as abundant as it is as
 
07:49:35.830 --> 07:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
you move further north
 
07:49:37.990 --> 07:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the past three years that we've we've
 
07:49:40.708 --> 07:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
compiled data for so for 2021
 
07:49:41.990 --> 07:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't gone through and entered all
 
07:49:43.590 --> 07:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
that data yet so
 
07:49:46.468 --> 07:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
for so for the past three years 18 19
 
07:49:49.670 --> 07:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
and 20 a total of 168 hairs
 
07:49:51.590 --> 07:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
have been captured
 
07:49:55.590 --> 07:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:58.310 --> 07:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
the department also tracks hunter effort
 
07:49:59.830 --> 07:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and again hunter observation rates
 
07:50:03.350 --> 07:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
similar as reference to grey squirrels
 
07:50:05.590 --> 07:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
long-term trends in the observation rate
 
07:50:07.830 --> 07:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
of snowshoe hare have been stable
 
07:50:09.750 --> 07:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
again like many wildlife species there's
 
07:50:12.070 --> 07:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
populations annually or fluctuations
 
07:50:13.990 --> 07:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
annually in the population over time but
 
07:50:15.750 --> 07:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
the long-term trend for snowshoe here in
 
07:50:18.948 --> 07:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:20.868 --> 07:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
additionally clubs are required to
 
07:50:22.948 --> 07:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
submit annual snowshoe hero live capture
 
07:50:24.628 --> 07:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
summary reports
 
07:50:26.070 --> 07:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
and that includes information on the
 
07:50:28.150 --> 07:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
number of traps that are set
 
07:50:30.708 --> 07:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
trapping effort
 
07:50:32.948 --> 07:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
the number of hairs caught by sex town
 
07:50:34.948 --> 07:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
and wildlife management unit
 
07:50:37.350 --> 07:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
the number of hairs retained by the club
 
07:50:39.510 --> 07:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
any non-target wildlife species that are
 
07:50:42.310 --> 07:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
captured any mortality that might occur
 
07:50:44.230 --> 07:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
during the trapping process
 
07:50:45.830 --> 07:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
and also the number of hairs that were
 
07:50:47.590 --> 07:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
propagated by the club the preceding
 
07:50:47.600 --> 07:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
propagated by the club the preceding
year

07:50:49.270 --> 07:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:50:52.150 --> 07:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
these rules were further amended in 2021
 
07:50:54.150 --> 07:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
to require conservation officers to
 
07:50:56.310 --> 07:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
visit the clubs at least once annually
 
07:50:57.910 --> 07:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
to select a hair for veterinary
 
07:51:00.548 --> 07:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
inspection by a licensed veterinarian
 
07:51:02.628 --> 07:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
to date i reviewed all veterinary
 
07:51:04.468 --> 07:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
inspections we've received
 
07:51:06.788 --> 07:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
and all veterinary inspections indicate
 
07:51:08.230 --> 07:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
that the animal that was examined was in
 
07:51:10.868 --> 07:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
good physical condition
 
07:51:12.708 --> 07:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
there's certainly no doubt
 
07:51:14.388 --> 07:51:14.398 align:start position:0%
that this practice creates an emotional
 
07:51:14.398 --> 07:51:16.230 align:start position:0%
that this practice creates an emotional
debate

07:51:16.230 --> 07:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
debate
 
07:51:17.590 --> 07:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
but the department feels that its
 
07:51:20.070 --> 07:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
current administrative rules
 
07:51:23.430 --> 07:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
are sufficient to to safeguard the
 
07:51:25.830 --> 07:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
overall population in the state
 
07:51:27.430 --> 07:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
we do not feel that the continued
 
07:51:29.670 --> 07:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
practice has a detrimental effect to the
 
07:51:32.388 --> 07:51:32.398 align:start position:0%
overall snowshoe hair population thank
 
07:51:34.468 --> 07:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
07:51:36.708 --> 07:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
questions for mr bergeron
 
07:51:38.150 --> 07:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine go ahead
 
07:51:39.990 --> 07:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
question and a follow-up if necessary
 
07:51:41.350 --> 07:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:51:43.270 --> 07:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr bergeron for taking my
 
07:51:45.590 --> 07:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
question um since
 
07:51:47.510 --> 07:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:51:49.190 --> 07:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
entire program has been expanded to be
 
07:51:51.030 --> 07:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
statewide for the live trapping how
 
07:51:52.628 --> 07:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
important has this
 
07:51:54.388 --> 07:51:54.398 align:start position:0%
life trapping been to your data on the
 
07:51:59.110 --> 07:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:59.120 --> 07:52:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:52:00.230 --> 07:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:52:01.830 --> 07:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't i don't think we've really
 
07:52:03.270 --> 07:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
gotten much
 
07:52:05.830 --> 07:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to the the new england
 
07:52:05.840 --> 07:52:07.110 align:start position:0%
in regards to the the new england
cottontail

07:52:07.110 --> 07:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
cottontail
 
07:52:09.190 --> 07:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know is there any data
 
07:52:10.628 --> 07:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
that would have benefited us through the
 
07:52:12.150 --> 07:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
management of that species has come out
 
07:52:13.750 --> 07:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
of it
 
07:52:16.708 --> 07:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:19.430 --> 07:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
how many hairs can be killed by a hunter
 
07:52:21.190 --> 07:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
in a given year if they're not being
 
07:52:24.070 --> 07:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:26.230 --> 07:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
colonel what's the what's the limit on
 
07:52:30.948 --> 07:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:30.958 --> 07:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
or

07:52:31.670 --> 07:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:52:31.680 --> 07:52:32.468 align:start position:0%
or
sorry

07:52:32.468 --> 07:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:52:34.310 --> 07:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
the daily bag limit
 
07:52:36.948 --> 07:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
three so three a day three a day
 
07:52:43.510 --> 07:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:45.270 --> 07:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of hairs that could be
 
07:52:45.280 --> 07:52:46.788 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of hairs that could be
killed

07:52:46.788 --> 07:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
killed
 
07:52:49.110 --> 07:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
07:52:50.948 --> 07:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
representative kittridge
 
07:52:52.230 --> 07:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question and a
 
07:52:54.468 --> 07:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
follow-up if necessary
 
07:52:57.110 --> 07:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes does the department examine these
 
07:52:59.750 --> 07:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
enclosures which are 50 to 100 acres
 
07:52:59.760 --> 07:53:00.628 align:start position:0%
enclosures which are 50 to 100 acres
that

07:53:00.628 --> 07:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:53:02.788 --> 07:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh are trying are the training grounds
 
07:53:05.590 --> 07:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
for these snowshoe harris so the law
 
07:53:07.350 --> 07:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement does have the authority to
 
07:53:08.708 --> 07:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
do that
 
07:53:10.468 --> 07:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
and likely they would see these
 
07:53:12.150 --> 07:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
enclosures when they go there to select
 
07:53:14.388 --> 07:53:14.398 align:start position:0%
a rabbit for inspection do you check
 
07:53:16.070 --> 07:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
them for uh
 
07:53:18.468 --> 07:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
you check them for appropriate habitat
 
07:53:18.478 --> 07:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
you check them for appropriate habitat
for

07:53:19.190 --> 07:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:53:22.150 --> 07:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
hairs hiding and so forth you know
 
07:53:25.430 --> 07:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i believe out of necessity um
 
07:53:27.190 --> 07:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that these hairs survive
 
07:53:29.670 --> 07:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
in there the habitat is is
 
07:53:31.590 --> 07:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
from what i understand from people who
 
07:53:33.110 --> 07:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
visited these there's sufficient cover
 
07:53:34.310 --> 07:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the hair
 
07:53:35.910 --> 07:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
07:53:37.590 --> 07:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman chair recognized
 
07:53:39.110 --> 07:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative craig for a question and
 
07:53:40.868 --> 07:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
necessary a follow-up
 
07:53:43.510 --> 07:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr bergeron
 
07:53:43.520 --> 07:53:44.948 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr bergeron
uh

07:53:44.948 --> 07:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:53:46.388 --> 07:53:46.398 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
07:53:48.788 --> 07:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
hairs are
 
07:53:51.830 --> 07:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
very susceptible to changes in
 
07:53:54.070 --> 07:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
the local environment due to logging and
 
07:53:54.080 --> 07:53:55.030 align:start position:0%
the local environment due to logging and
other

07:53:55.030 --> 07:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:53:57.990 --> 07:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
pressures do you find that
 
07:53:59.910 --> 07:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
these enclosures
 
07:54:01.830 --> 07:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
are maintained
 
07:54:04.628 --> 07:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
better for their survival
 
07:54:07.190 --> 07:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
than if they were just in the wild in
 
07:54:09.590 --> 07:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
land that might be logged or burned or
 
07:54:09.600 --> 07:54:11.190 align:start position:0%
land that might be logged or burned or
grazed

07:54:11.190 --> 07:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
grazed
 
07:54:11.200 --> 07:54:14.548 align:start position:0%
grazed
um

07:54:14.548 --> 07:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:16.628 --> 07:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
so so
 
07:54:19.350 --> 07:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
so you know wildlife will seek out you
 
07:54:21.030 --> 07:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
know the most appropriate habitat in the
 
07:54:21.040 --> 07:54:22.708 align:start position:0%
know the most appropriate habitat in the
area

07:54:22.708 --> 07:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
area
 
07:54:24.948 --> 07:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
i would say that the again i've never
 
07:54:26.548 --> 07:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
visited any of these facilities i'd just
 
07:54:30.070 --> 07:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
like to to say that um my understanding
 
07:54:32.310 --> 07:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that uh from from individuals who
 
07:54:34.788 --> 07:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
have that there is adequate cover in
 
07:54:37.910 --> 07:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
these um in these facilities again these
 
07:54:39.190 --> 07:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
enclosures from my understanding are
 
07:54:43.430 --> 07:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:44.868 --> 07:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of things that
 
07:54:47.110 --> 07:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
impact habitat for a number of wildlife
 
07:54:49.350 --> 07:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
species throughout the state
 
07:54:50.868 --> 07:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
you know it was referenced earlier that
 
07:54:52.788 --> 07:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
there was loss of habitat for hair that
 
07:54:54.628 --> 07:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
that is true in southern portions of the
 
07:54:57.030 --> 07:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
state um you know we routinely lose
 
07:54:59.670 --> 07:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
habitat to development um there's less
 
07:55:02.310 --> 07:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
forestry practices that go on um
 
07:55:04.070 --> 07:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know the northern part of the state
 
07:55:06.310 --> 07:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
is certainly where the primary snowshoe
 
07:55:08.310 --> 07:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
hair habitat is
 
07:55:10.548 --> 07:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
but but again my understanding from
 
07:55:13.110 --> 07:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who visited these sites
 
07:55:15.030 --> 07:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
there is adequate cover for the hair at
 
07:55:18.628 --> 07:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:21.110 --> 07:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
07:55:23.510 --> 07:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
i have i have a couple
 
07:55:26.310 --> 07:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
so when i look at line five in this bill
 
07:55:27.430 --> 07:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of the bill in front
 
07:55:29.590 --> 07:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
of you
 
07:55:32.628 --> 07:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about about three words
 
07:55:34.230 --> 07:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill that may cause a problem
 
07:55:36.468 --> 07:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
for fish and game and one of them is and
 
07:55:39.510 --> 07:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
the words are in this state
 
07:55:41.670 --> 07:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
which means that you can't
 
07:55:43.430 --> 07:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
07:55:45.430 --> 07:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
take live snowshoe hairs or rabbits from
 
07:55:47.590 --> 07:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
the wild in this state does that create
 
07:55:49.350 --> 07:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
an importation problem and potential if
 
07:55:50.948 --> 07:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
we allow importation because we don't
 
07:55:53.350 --> 07:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
allow capture in our own state but you
 
07:55:54.788 --> 07:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
can capture in another state and bring
 
07:55:56.708 --> 07:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
them in would that
 
07:56:01.350 --> 07:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:03.590 --> 07:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
i would have to review our current
 
07:56:06.468 --> 07:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
importation rules and see what category
 
07:56:08.868 --> 07:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
um hair would fall under
 
07:56:10.230 --> 07:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not they were controlled or
 
07:56:11.990 --> 07:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited and
 
07:56:12.000 --> 07:56:12.788 align:start position:0%
prohibited and
nice

07:56:12.788 --> 07:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
nice
 
07:56:14.628 --> 07:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you my second question goes to a
 
07:56:16.868 --> 07:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
little bit of constitutionality is in
 
07:56:19.750 --> 07:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
the last part of this again from seven
 
07:56:21.190 --> 07:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
to ten
 
07:56:21.200 --> 07:56:22.310 align:start position:0%
to ten
um

07:56:22.310 --> 07:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:24.548 --> 07:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
we have a taking of property occurring
 
07:56:26.788 --> 07:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
where we're taking a private citizen's
 
07:56:28.708 --> 07:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
property being the snowshoe here after
 
07:56:31.030 --> 07:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
they've legally captured it and they've
 
07:56:32.788 --> 07:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
they're taking care of it
 
07:56:35.030 --> 07:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're taking that property and creating
 
07:56:37.830 --> 07:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
retrospectively a law against that
 
07:56:39.590 --> 07:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
against that property do you think that
 
07:56:41.910 --> 07:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
potentially causes some liabilities or
 
07:56:43.590 --> 07:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
some issues with us with creating either
 
07:56:45.990 --> 07:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
a retrospective law or the taking of a
 
07:56:48.788 --> 07:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
person's property without due process
 
07:56:48.798 --> 07:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
person's property without due process
um

07:56:49.990 --> 07:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:51.430 --> 07:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
i could foresee an instance where it
 
07:56:53.430 --> 07:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
certainly could
 
07:56:54.628 --> 07:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:56:56.708 --> 07:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
i'll preface that with my backgrounds in
 
07:56:59.030 --> 07:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife management so that's not my
 
07:57:01.110 --> 07:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
area of expertise but i certainly could
 
07:57:03.350 --> 07:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
foresee that happening
 
07:57:04.708 --> 07:57:04.718 align:start position:0%

state in opposition to the bill it's
 
07:57:45.910 --> 07:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
interesting because i got my start in
 
07:57:49.350 --> 07:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
purebred dogs uh as a child with beagles
 
07:57:52.708 --> 07:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh and i was fascinated by their natural
 
07:57:56.230 --> 07:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to track and trace
 
07:57:57.750 --> 07:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
hair this is out in the state of
 
07:57:57.760 --> 07:57:59.590 align:start position:0%
hair this is out in the state of
california

07:57:59.590 --> 07:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
california
 
07:58:00.468 --> 07:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
that is
 
07:58:03.350 --> 07:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me led me on to
 
07:58:05.430 --> 07:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
what has become my lifelong
 
07:58:07.990 --> 07:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
pursuit of another performance bred
 
07:58:10.548 --> 07:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
animal which is siberian huskies which i
 
07:58:12.628 --> 07:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
have trained and raced
 
07:58:15.270 --> 07:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh basically all over the united states
 
07:58:16.548 --> 07:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
and canada
 
07:58:18.788 --> 07:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak to the fact that a
 
07:58:20.468 --> 07:58:20.478 align:start position:0%
well-trained dog
 
07:58:23.030 --> 07:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of the breed is an asset to
 
07:58:24.388 --> 07:58:24.398 align:start position:0%
its owner
 
07:58:26.548 --> 07:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
07:58:29.190 --> 07:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
time that is spent by the beaglers in
 
07:58:32.388 --> 07:58:32.398 align:start position:0%
the attempt to train their dogs is an
 
07:58:32.398 --> 07:58:34.070 align:start position:0%
the attempt to train their dogs is an
admirable

07:58:34.070 --> 07:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
admirable
 
07:58:34.080 --> 07:58:35.190 align:start position:0%
admirable
aspect

07:58:35.190 --> 07:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
07:58:36.708 --> 07:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
not only for
 
07:58:40.468 --> 07:58:40.478 align:start position:0%
the preservation of a historic breed the
 
07:58:42.310 --> 07:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
beagle like the siberian husky it's a
 
07:58:43.830 --> 07:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
very fundamental
 
07:58:45.430 --> 07:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh early
 
07:58:48.310 --> 07:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
well-known breed and needs to be
 
07:58:48.320 --> 07:58:49.590 align:start position:0%
well-known breed and needs to be
propagated

07:58:49.590 --> 07:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
propagated
 
07:58:52.948 --> 07:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
for its original intended purpose
 
07:58:54.548 --> 07:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'll throw out another
 
07:58:54.558 --> 07:58:55.590 align:start position:0%
i'll throw out another
aspect

07:58:55.590 --> 07:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
07:58:55.600 --> 07:58:56.310 align:start position:0%
aspect
i

07:58:56.310 --> 07:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:58:59.030 --> 07:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a certified tree farm in jefferson
 
07:59:02.868 --> 07:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
so i'm operating a temp timber operation
 
07:59:05.030 --> 07:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
the three basic tenets of
 
07:59:07.430 --> 07:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
force proper forest management planning
 
07:59:09.030 --> 07:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
timber value
 
07:59:12.468 --> 07:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
wildlife improvement and erosion control
 
07:59:14.548 --> 07:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do anything in this
 
07:59:16.548 --> 07:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
state which is so heavily involved in
 
07:59:16.558 --> 07:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
state which is so heavily involved in
the

07:59:17.430 --> 07:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:59:20.070 --> 07:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
forestry industry to do anything to
 
07:59:20.080 --> 07:59:21.430 align:start position:0%
forestry industry to do anything to
degrade

07:59:21.430 --> 07:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
degrade
 
07:59:21.440 --> 07:59:22.868 align:start position:0%
degrade
the

07:59:22.868 --> 07:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:59:24.230 --> 07:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
support for
 
07:59:27.030 --> 07:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
item number two the wildlife management
 
07:59:28.868 --> 07:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
aspect of forest management planning
 
07:59:30.388 --> 07:59:30.398 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason that the hairs are
 
07:59:32.468 --> 07:59:32.478 align:start position:0%
up in northern new hampshire
 
07:59:34.628 --> 07:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
tree farm operators like myself we spend
 
07:59:36.708 --> 07:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of time tweaking our forest
 
07:59:38.868 --> 07:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
management plans to provide for wildlife
 
07:59:42.788 --> 07:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:47.110 --> 07:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:50.388 --> 07:59:50.398 align:start position:0%
practice as regulated currently by the
 
07:59:51.830 --> 07:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
gel car rules
 
07:59:54.310 --> 07:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
has worked for a long time it's not
 
07:59:58.468 --> 07:59:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:01.830 --> 08:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
final final point uh no one has yet
 
08:00:04.388 --> 08:00:04.398 align:start position:0%
referred to the protections and the
 
08:00:07.350 --> 08:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
regulations are contained in rsa 644.8
 
08:00:09.590 --> 08:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
the cruelty statutes i think you'll find
 
08:00:11.350 --> 08:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
that none of the beagle clubs have ever
 
08:00:14.388 --> 08:00:14.398 align:start position:0%
been run afoul of any of the criteria
 
08:00:17.670 --> 08:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
within 644.8 which protects uh wild
 
08:00:20.548 --> 08:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
animals in captivity thank you very much
 
08:00:22.150 --> 08:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your test testimony mr
 
08:00:24.948 --> 08:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
cook are there any questions for mr cook
 
08:00:26.388 --> 08:00:26.398 align:start position:0%
seeing none sir thank you for coming
 
08:00:29.910 --> 08:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:33.270 --> 08:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
next up is matthew mckenis
 
08:00:36.468 --> 08:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
mckernes um who is opposing the bill
 
08:00:39.910 --> 08:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:41.670 --> 08:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
hello my name is matthew mckearney i'm
 
08:00:43.190 --> 08:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
the president of claremont beagle club
 
08:00:45.670 --> 08:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i am here to oppose 1308
 
08:00:46.948 --> 08:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
i would like to talk to you today about
 
08:00:48.388 --> 08:00:48.398 align:start position:0%
the importance of hound trials and the
 
08:00:50.070 --> 08:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
effect that they will have on the state
 
08:00:51.350 --> 08:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the beagle breed if they were no
 
08:00:53.270 --> 08:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
longer able to continue
 
08:00:54.868 --> 08:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
a little back story is the first beagle
 
08:00:56.230 --> 08:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
trial was actually held in hyannis
 
08:00:59.110 --> 08:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts on november 4th in 1890
 
08:01:00.868 --> 08:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
there was a total of 18 entries and
 
08:01:02.628 --> 08:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
since that day the popularity of these
 
08:01:04.708 --> 08:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
trials has grown exponentially
 
08:01:06.468 --> 08:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
at claremont club we will see upwards of
 
08:01:08.868 --> 08:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
200 dogs spread across four classes in
 
08:01:11.830 --> 08:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
two days of competition
 
08:01:13.990 --> 08:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
with a total of over twenty four
 
08:01:15.910 --> 08:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dogs competing in akc
 
08:01:17.270 --> 08:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
sanctioned events in new hampshire
 
08:01:19.830 --> 08:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
during the 2019 season these events draw
 
08:01:21.430 --> 08:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
a large number of people and their
 
08:01:23.590 --> 08:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
families to new hampshire multiple times
 
08:01:25.590 --> 08:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
a year
 
08:01:27.350 --> 08:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
and while doing so they add an influx of
 
08:01:29.430 --> 08:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
money to the local economies
 
08:01:31.430 --> 08:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
including sales of gas as they dine out
 
08:01:34.230 --> 08:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the hospitality industry
 
08:01:35.990 --> 08:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
these people also travel back to the
 
08:01:37.670 --> 08:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
state during the hunting seasons again
 
08:01:39.830 --> 08:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
paying for guides gear lodging
 
08:01:41.670 --> 08:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
non-resident hunting licenses that i can
 
08:01:44.788 --> 08:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
tell you from experience are not cheap
 
08:01:46.230 --> 08:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
08:01:48.628 --> 08:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
10 887
 
08:01:50.310 --> 08:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
non-resident hunting licenses were sold
 
08:01:51.830 --> 08:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire generating
 
08:01:53.510 --> 08:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
a massive income for the state and its
 
08:01:55.350 --> 08:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
conservation programs
 
08:01:57.110 --> 08:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
while also providing jobs and a source
 
08:02:00.468 --> 08:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
of income for residents of the state
 
08:02:02.468 --> 08:02:02.478 align:start position:0%
in a beagle trial a group of hounds is
 
08:02:03.990 --> 08:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
cast into the grounds to be judged on
 
08:02:05.750 --> 08:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
how well and accurate they can track the
 
08:02:07.030 --> 08:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
desired game
 
08:02:08.788 --> 08:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
this type of trial is a tool used by
 
08:02:10.388 --> 08:02:10.398 align:start position:0%
breeders and handlers to ensure that
 
08:02:11.910 --> 08:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
proper traits are being passed down
 
08:02:13.910 --> 08:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
generationally with the ability to
 
08:02:15.430 --> 08:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
compete our hounds with one another we
 
08:02:17.350 --> 08:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
have are able to view any faults or
 
08:02:19.110 --> 08:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
negative traits while also nurturing the
 
08:02:21.270 --> 08:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
positive ones this is very helpful when
 
08:02:22.948 --> 08:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
it comes to the selection of dogs deemed
 
08:02:24.548 --> 08:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
fit for breeding to ensure that we are
 
08:02:26.230 --> 08:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
furthering those positive or desired
 
08:02:28.708 --> 08:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
traits to continue bettering the breed
 
08:02:31.430 --> 08:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
through selective breeding
 
08:02:33.270 --> 08:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
dog trials are popular events all over
 
08:02:34.868 --> 08:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
the country with ribbons and sometimes
 
08:02:36.708 --> 08:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
small trophies or plaques being awarded
 
08:02:38.628 --> 08:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
to the five placing hounds and while
 
08:02:40.788 --> 08:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
these things have no monetary value they
 
08:02:42.628 --> 08:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
do signify a large amount of hard work
 
08:02:48.388 --> 08:02:48.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:49.910 --> 08:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
along with the ribbons the placing hound
 
08:02:51.430 --> 08:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
is awarded points based on how many
 
08:02:52.948 --> 08:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
hounds were entered in the trial and
 
08:02:55.990 --> 08:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
their placing in akc it takes three wins
 
08:02:57.990 --> 08:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and 120 points to earn the title of
 
08:03:00.150 --> 08:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
field champion and this is the ultimate
 
08:03:02.388 --> 08:03:02.398 align:start position:0%
goal of any trialer the pursuit of a
 
08:03:03.910 --> 08:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
title or what is known as finishing a
 
08:03:05.750 --> 08:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
dog is what has us up before dawn
 
08:03:07.830 --> 08:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
traveling and competing
 
08:03:09.670 --> 08:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
beagles are long distance endurance
 
08:03:12.150 --> 08:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
runners and it is not uncommon for these
 
08:03:14.310 --> 08:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
hard-working dogs to willingly travel 20
 
08:03:15.750 --> 08:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
miles in a day in pursuit of their
 
08:03:18.948 --> 08:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
quarry a wild rabbit or hair is the best
 
08:03:20.788 --> 08:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
test of a hound's tracking ability that
 
08:03:23.510 --> 08:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be replicated ten seconds sir
 
08:03:24.708 --> 08:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:03:26.468 --> 08:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
rabbits have a unique ability to travel
 
08:03:27.830 --> 08:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
at a fast rate of speed through tight
 
08:03:29.750 --> 08:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
and difficult terrain truly testing a
 
08:03:32.150 --> 08:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
hound's merit and ability while breeders
 
08:03:33.590 --> 08:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
and handlers strive to produce the
 
08:03:36.310 --> 08:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
absolute best hound we can even the best
 
08:03:38.948 --> 08:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
dog can be outsmarted by these creatures
 
08:03:40.230 --> 08:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony sarah
 
08:03:42.948 --> 08:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
questions for matthew
 
08:03:44.310 --> 08:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
seeing done matt thanks for coming in
 
08:03:45.590 --> 08:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
testifying today in front of the fish
 
08:03:47.270 --> 08:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
and game committee
 
08:03:49.750 --> 08:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
08:03:52.628 --> 08:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
robert ferrante
 
08:03:55.350 --> 08:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
from the claremont beagle club
 
08:04:01.270 --> 08:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:02.788 --> 08:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of new hampshire
 
08:04:05.830 --> 08:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game and marine sources
 
08:04:09.190 --> 08:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
i am in opposition of uh passage bill
 
08:04:10.788 --> 08:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
sir can you just speak into the mic so
 
08:04:12.628 --> 08:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
everybody could hear you better
 
08:04:12.638 --> 08:04:13.510 align:start position:0%
everybody could hear you better
okay

08:04:13.510 --> 08:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:04:16.310 --> 08:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
i am in opposition of the passage of um
 
08:04:19.030 --> 08:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
hb 1308 which says it is a bill
 
08:04:21.110 --> 08:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the capture possession and
 
08:04:23.590 --> 08:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
propagation of hairs and rabbits for
 
08:04:26.628 --> 08:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
hunting and training a field trial
 
08:04:29.190 --> 08:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill about saving hairs it
 
08:04:31.990 --> 08:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
is a bill about ending try tracking dogs
 
08:04:33.750 --> 08:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
hunting training and field trials in new
 
08:04:33.760 --> 08:04:35.910 align:start position:0%
hunting training and field trials in new
hampshire

08:04:35.910 --> 08:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:04:37.750 --> 08:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
providing all the rules and licensings
 
08:04:39.750 --> 08:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
of all it is not illegal to hunt in new
 
08:04:41.670 --> 08:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire it is not illegal to hunt with
 
08:04:44.230 --> 08:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
dogs it is not illegal to train hunting
 
08:04:46.628 --> 08:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
dogs and it is not illegal to use live
 
08:04:48.468 --> 08:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
animals in training
 
08:04:50.388 --> 08:04:50.398 align:start position:0%
so the issues addressed by this bill are
 
08:04:51.990 --> 08:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
not the training
 
08:04:53.990 --> 08:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
of all hunting dogs not the training of
 
08:04:55.910 --> 08:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
dogs with live animals
 
08:04:58.150 --> 08:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
not the holding or all sorts of all
 
08:05:00.548 --> 08:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
sorts of hunting and sports events
 
08:05:02.708 --> 08:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
not the trapping or relocation of hairs
 
08:05:04.948 --> 08:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
and not the use of very large habitat
 
08:05:07.190 --> 08:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
pins to use hairs or rabbits
 
08:05:09.270 --> 08:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
the only intent is to prohibit one group
 
08:05:10.948 --> 08:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
of hunters from safely training their
 
08:05:13.670 --> 08:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
dogs and hunting in new hampshire
 
08:05:15.830 --> 08:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
rabbits are hairs and under and are
 
08:05:17.590 --> 08:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
under predator pressure your entire
 
08:05:17.600 --> 08:05:18.948 align:start position:0%
under predator pressure your entire
lives

08:05:18.948 --> 08:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
lives
 
08:05:20.708 --> 08:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
the difference between wild predators
 
08:05:22.868 --> 08:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
and tracking dogs is that wild predators
 
08:05:24.868 --> 08:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
intend to kill and eat the rabbits while
 
08:05:27.510 --> 08:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
the dogs simply track them
 
08:05:29.910 --> 08:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there's no unpleasant endings to
 
08:05:32.708 --> 08:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
those animals that attract
 
08:05:34.548 --> 08:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to be a discriminatory
 
08:05:36.548 --> 08:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
measure aimed at a certain segment of
 
08:05:38.708 --> 08:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
the public of the hunting public with
 
08:05:40.948 --> 08:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
the intent to ensure that these hunters
 
08:05:43.510 --> 08:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
and only these hunters have no safe
 
08:05:45.990 --> 08:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
place to train their dogs into and to
 
08:05:48.230 --> 08:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit the dog clubs from holding
 
08:05:50.548 --> 08:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
field trial competition
 
08:05:52.230 --> 08:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
loss of habitat in the southern
 
08:05:54.548 --> 08:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of new hampshire has resulted
 
08:05:56.230 --> 08:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
in a majority of the snowshoe hair
 
08:05:58.468 --> 08:05:58.478 align:start position:0%
population being in the northern three
 
08:06:00.548 --> 08:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
counties of the state
 
08:06:03.110 --> 08:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
moving a small portion of these hairs to
 
08:06:05.910 --> 08:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
enclose habitats in more southern areas
 
08:06:08.150 --> 08:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the state may well prove to be an
 
08:06:10.468 --> 08:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
advantage in attaining the population
 
08:06:12.468 --> 08:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
should any disease or disease strike
 
08:06:14.628 --> 08:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
those northern three counties
 
08:06:16.708 --> 08:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
sporting dog clubs provide an enclosure
 
08:06:19.350 --> 08:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
habitat suitable for the relocation of
 
08:06:21.910 --> 08:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
hairs to live in a and reproduce
 
08:06:24.388 --> 08:06:24.398 align:start position:0%
in more southern new hampshire locations
 
08:06:26.388 --> 08:06:26.398 align:start position:0%
while you could call it a pin
 
08:06:28.868 --> 08:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
15 to 120 acres really is a natural
 
08:06:32.310 --> 08:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
territory and is managed in a mere
 
08:06:34.868 --> 08:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
managed habitat for these rabbits ten
 
08:06:35.990 --> 08:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
seconds sir
 
08:06:36.000 --> 08:06:39.350 align:start position:0%
seconds sir
okay

08:06:39.350 --> 08:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:42.708 --> 08:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
the reality is that here
 
08:06:45.270 --> 08:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
are not a species that
 
08:06:46.628 --> 08:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
is not going to be
 
08:06:48.230 --> 08:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to lose the species if
 
08:06:50.548 --> 08:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
we continue to be able to propagate them
 
08:06:52.868 --> 08:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
in these pins this bill is designed to
 
08:06:55.510 --> 08:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
unjustly apply unequal treatment under
 
08:06:59.110 --> 08:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
the law to specific subset of hunters
 
08:07:01.030 --> 08:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
please vote this bill and explicitly to
 
08:07:03.110 --> 08:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
the legal attempt to allow us to be able
 
08:07:05.830 --> 08:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
to trap these 20 rabbits and be able to
 
08:07:08.070 --> 08:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
continue what we do and love thank you

08:07:45.590 --> 08:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has three species of
 
08:07:47.110 --> 08:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
rabbit the new england cottontail the
 
08:07:49.350 --> 08:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
eastern cottontail and the snowshoe hare
 
08:07:51.270 --> 08:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hair or varying hair as they
 
08:07:53.030 --> 08:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
are also called are an interesting
 
08:07:54.948 --> 08:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
animal they are not actually rabbits but
 
08:07:56.628 --> 08:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
a different species all on their own
 
08:07:58.230 --> 08:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
they only weigh three to five pounds and
 
08:07:59.750 --> 08:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
aren't social animals other than for
 
08:08:01.750 --> 08:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
breeding they are not born in nests like
 
08:08:03.670 --> 08:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
other rabbits they are born with eyes
 
08:08:05.430 --> 08:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
open covered in hair with the ability to
 
08:08:07.110 --> 08:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
move around from day one because that is
 
08:08:09.030 --> 08:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
what they have evolved to do they are
 
08:08:10.230 --> 08:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
also smart and wary of their
 
08:08:12.150 --> 08:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
surroundings hair
 
08:08:13.830 --> 08:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
are one of the only animals that can
 
08:08:15.350 --> 08:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
survive on their own excrement in the
 
08:08:16.788 --> 08:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
times of the year where feed is hard to
 
08:08:19.590 --> 08:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
find hair is also very good at hiding
 
08:08:21.350 --> 08:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
and will hear you or your dog coming
 
08:08:23.030 --> 08:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
before you get within 100 yards of them
 
08:08:25.110 --> 08:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is why they have those big ears
 
08:08:27.030 --> 08:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
hair are also mostly active at dawn and
 
08:08:28.788 --> 08:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
dusk these things combined with the fact
 
08:08:30.388 --> 08:08:30.398 align:start position:0%
that they are only one of seven animals
 
08:08:31.670 --> 08:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
that will change
 
08:08:33.190 --> 08:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
to the color white when the day length
 
08:08:35.270 --> 08:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
changes in what makes them evasive
 
08:08:36.948 --> 08:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
only one to thirty percent of hair
 
08:08:38.548 --> 08:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
survive their first year of life in the
 
08:08:40.868 --> 08:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
wild this is why hair are avid breeders
 
08:08:42.388 --> 08:08:42.398 align:start position:0%
having two to four litters per year with
 
08:08:44.548 --> 08:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
an average of three per liter
 
08:08:46.388 --> 08:08:46.398 align:start position:0%
they can jump up to 10 feet in a bound
 
08:08:48.468 --> 08:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
and travel up to 28 miles per hour
 
08:08:51.190 --> 08:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare populations cycle in 8 to
 
08:08:52.708 --> 08:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
eight to eleven year periods and
 
08:08:54.468 --> 08:08:54.478 align:start position:0%
densities may fluctuate five to twenty
 
08:08:56.468 --> 08:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
five percent during a cycle this means
 
08:08:59.110 --> 08:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
the population of hair is always in flux

at claremont beagle club snowshoe hair
 
08:09:02.310 --> 08:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
are very valuable to us
 
08:09:03.830 --> 08:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have two 100 acre pens that are
 
08:09:05.190 --> 08:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
managed to fit the needs of the hair as
 
08:09:06.868 --> 08:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
well as to protect the hair from outside
 
08:09:08.948 --> 08:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
predation we do everything possible and
 
08:09:10.628 --> 08:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
legal we can to protect the hair but
 
08:09:12.150 --> 08:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
live trapping hair allows us to bring
 
08:09:14.230 --> 08:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
new dna to the existing population as
 
08:09:15.830 --> 08:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
well as restock from losses due to

well as restock from losses due to
predation

predation
 
08:09:18.788 --> 08:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
snowshahara live in a specific habitat
 
08:09:20.468 --> 08:09:20.478 align:start position:0%
which is young coniferous forest that
 
08:09:21.910 --> 08:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
have dense thickets and are usually
 
08:09:21.920 --> 08:09:22.948 align:start position:0%
have dense thickets and are usually
swampy

08:09:22.948 --> 08:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
swampy
 
08:09:24.468 --> 08:09:24.478 align:start position:0%
at the claremont club we plant trees
 
08:09:26.150 --> 08:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
everywhere as well as select cut to help
 
08:09:27.670 --> 08:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
manage the growth the growth of these
 
08:09:30.310 --> 08:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
tickets in 2020 we planted over 2000
 
08:09:33.830 --> 08:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
trees and another 500 in 2021 to ensure
 
08:09:35.430 --> 08:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
the hair have proper habitat we have
 
08:09:37.190 --> 08:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
done this with guidance from county and
 
08:09:38.708 --> 08:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
state foresters
 
08:09:40.230 --> 08:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
we are also the only state that has
 
08:09:41.910 --> 08:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
specific trapping laws for rabbit and
 
08:09:43.990 --> 08:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
hair 20 hair per club with already
 
08:09:46.628 --> 08:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
strict restrictions
 
08:09:48.468 --> 08:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
you've already heard all this
 
08:09:50.150 --> 08:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
trapping hair is an easy task with the
 
08:09:52.388 --> 08:09:52.398 align:start position:0%
abundance of live traps set and checked
 
08:09:54.230 --> 08:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis it does not guarantee a
 
08:09:56.388 --> 08:09:56.398 align:start position:0%
catch you have 10 seconds left in our
 
08:09:56.398 --> 08:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
catch you have 10 seconds left in our
summaries

08:09:57.990 --> 08:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
summaries
 
08:10:00.070 --> 08:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
um i just want to say that
 
08:10:01.990 --> 08:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
they we can only trap on private lands
 
08:10:05.030 --> 08:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
also and some places up north have also
 
08:10:05.040 --> 08:10:06.628 align:start position:0%
also and some places up north have also
deemed

08:10:06.628 --> 08:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
08:10:08.388 --> 08:10:08.398 align:start position:0%
that the hare our nuisance animal to
 
08:10:10.310 --> 08:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
them because they do eat the bark and
 
08:10:12.310 --> 08:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
destroy some trees which also causes
 
08:10:14.948 --> 08:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
habitat loss and
 
08:10:17.990 --> 08:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
economic loss to people's businesses
 
08:10:19.990 --> 08:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much keller any questions
 
08:10:23.430 --> 08:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
for colin representative spelaine sorry
 
08:10:24.788 --> 08:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
08:10:26.868 --> 08:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
my question uh you've done some
 
08:10:29.830 --> 08:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
impressive conservation work on 200-acre
 
08:10:32.150 --> 08:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh areas there would it be fair to say
 
08:10:33.750 --> 08:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that would probably cease if you
 
08:10:35.750 --> 08:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
could no longer use those as habitat for
 
08:10:38.948 --> 08:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:38.958 --> 08:10:40.388 align:start position:0%
 
representative

08:10:40.388 --> 08:10:40.398 align:start position:0%
representative
 
08:10:43.430 --> 08:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:45.910 --> 08:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair you may have um
 
08:10:46.948 --> 08:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned it
 
08:10:47.830 --> 08:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
i just
 
08:10:49.910 --> 08:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
may have missed it how many hair do you
 
08:10:52.948 --> 08:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
keep in your facility
 
08:10:54.150 --> 08:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
08:10:56.708 --> 08:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
very hard to keep track of them if you
 
08:10:58.788 --> 08:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
walk out into 100 acres and you walked
 
08:11:00.548 --> 08:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
around especially if they're always
 
08:11:02.868 --> 08:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
moving with them hearing you
 
08:11:06.150 --> 08:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to count them we do
 
08:11:08.150 --> 08:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
count as many as possible but we don't
 
08:11:10.230 --> 08:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
know if they are the same hair or a
 
08:11:11.430 --> 08:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
different hair we do have feeding
 
08:11:11.440 --> 08:11:12.548 align:start position:0%
different hair we do have feeding
stations

08:11:12.548 --> 08:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
stations
 
08:11:14.948 --> 08:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
and by
 
08:11:16.388 --> 08:11:16.398 align:start position:0%
judging on the amount of feed they eat
 
08:11:18.310 --> 08:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
we can kind of keep that as well as in
 
08:11:20.230 --> 08:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
the wintertime you can look at tracks
 
08:11:21.750 --> 08:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and you walk around
 
08:11:25.270 --> 08:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
between the five and 25 acres of
 
08:11:28.150 --> 08:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
a kind of a where they breed in their
 
08:11:31.030 --> 08:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
natural hab like in the wild if the
 
08:11:33.990 --> 08:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
habitat is prolific for them a hair will
 
08:11:35.670 --> 08:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
only take up about five acres so
 
08:11:38.070 --> 08:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
conceivably we could keep 20 hair or
 
08:11:42.070 --> 08:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
more you know in a club thank you
 
08:11:44.310 --> 08:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
08:11:45.830 --> 08:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
seeking no questions thank you very much
 
08:11:47.110 --> 08:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
kyle thank you thank you for coming to
 
08:11:50.310 --> 08:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:54.310 --> 08:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
next up is david price in opposition to
 
08:12:00.150 --> 08:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:01.510 --> 08:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody for staying late
 
08:12:03.990 --> 08:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
tonight i oppose this bill
 
08:12:05.830 --> 08:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
seeing how that
 
08:12:07.750 --> 08:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the population of hairs in the state is
 
08:12:09.430 --> 08:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
doing well and it's fine and we've been
 
08:12:10.788 --> 08:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
trapped in these hairs for quite some
 
08:12:13.030 --> 08:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
time now and there's no
 
08:12:15.350 --> 08:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
sign of us decreasing the population out
 
08:12:17.110 --> 08:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
there in the wild so it's just
 
08:12:19.670 --> 08:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
sustaining what we are doing now so i
 
08:12:21.430 --> 08:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe we should continue on what we're
 
08:12:22.548 --> 08:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
doing now
 
08:12:24.070 --> 08:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
in a safe
 
08:12:26.948 --> 08:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
area to run our dogs is key to keep our
 
08:12:29.670 --> 08:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
hounds safe and our people safe
 
08:12:31.190 --> 08:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's good and you have
 
08:12:33.030 --> 08:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
fact sheets out there we have a vet come
 
08:12:34.788 --> 08:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
to a club every year
 
08:12:37.350 --> 08:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i've since 2016 i gave you all
 
08:12:39.510 --> 08:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
copies that we have great bill of health
 
08:12:41.110 --> 08:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
from every time a vet has come and
 
08:12:43.670 --> 08:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
checked our hairs in captivity so
 
08:12:45.670 --> 08:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's no issues there whatsoever
 
08:12:48.150 --> 08:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
having them in cactus captivity
 
08:12:50.548 --> 08:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
and i've been a new hampshire um
 
08:12:54.230 --> 08:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:55.590 --> 08:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr price and we have any
 
08:12:57.910 --> 08:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
questions for mr price representative
 
08:12:57.920 --> 08:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
questions for mr price representative
howard

08:12:59.750 --> 08:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
howard
 
08:13:01.350 --> 08:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
08:13:02.548 --> 08:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
my question
 
08:13:04.230 --> 08:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that if you
 
08:13:06.868 --> 08:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
tried to train a dog in the wild it's
 
08:13:08.468 --> 08:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
happened to run
 
08:13:10.468 --> 08:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
say a deer and then once they start
 
08:13:12.070 --> 08:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
running deer it's very hard to break
 
08:13:14.468 --> 08:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
them of that absolutely absolutely once
 
08:13:16.788 --> 08:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
they get a scent and and they take that
 
08:13:18.948 --> 08:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
scent it is hard to break it they're
 
08:13:21.110 --> 08:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
very very stubborn dog
 
08:13:22.868 --> 08:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
so it's key to have them on
 
08:13:25.110 --> 08:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
the right game when they're young and
 
08:13:27.030 --> 08:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
keep them on that right game for quite
 
08:13:28.788 --> 08:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
some time so that way that's all they
 
08:13:30.948 --> 08:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
track i could bring my dogs into a deer
 
08:13:32.310 --> 08:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
yard now and they will not touch the
 
08:13:32.320 --> 08:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
yard now and they will not touch the
deer

08:13:33.110 --> 08:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
deer
 
08:13:34.788 --> 08:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
they will run just the hair that are in
 
08:13:36.628 --> 08:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
the same yard thank you you're very
 
08:13:36.638 --> 08:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
the same yard thank you you're very
welcome

08:13:37.590 --> 08:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
welcome

heard some of the numbers and how
popular

08:14:36.150 --> 08:14:36.160 align:start position:0%

we feel the request to file house bill
 
08:15:15.030 --> 08:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
1308 is a challenge to the commission's
 
08:15:17.350 --> 08:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
authority and integrity and we're
 
08:15:19.750 --> 08:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to 1308
 
08:15:22.468 --> 08:15:22.478 align:start position:0%
i know you've heard a lot today and
 
08:15:24.230 --> 08:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions but i did want
 
08:15:26.788 --> 08:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
to state that the ethical
 
08:15:29.030 --> 08:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
ethical hunting demands that when
 
08:15:31.990 --> 08:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
hunting game animals which here are you
 
08:15:34.070 --> 08:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
make every effort to achieve the most
 
08:15:36.628 --> 08:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
quick and efficient harvest possible and
 
08:15:38.310 --> 08:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're abiding by state hunting
 
08:15:41.190 --> 08:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
regulations the best conservation tool
 
08:15:42.868 --> 08:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
is a well-trained hunting dog to
 
08:15:46.788 --> 08:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:48.628 --> 08:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
i'm here to answer any questions i
 
08:15:48.638 --> 08:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
i'm here to answer any questions i
believe

08:15:49.590 --> 08:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
believe
 
08:15:51.190 --> 08:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
other testimony has
 
08:15:52.510 --> 08:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the myths and the
 
08:15:54.708 --> 08:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization of how these
 
08:15:57.030 --> 08:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
activities have been conducted
 
08:15:59.510 --> 08:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
i can say on some of the flyers
 
08:16:01.910 --> 08:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
information for instance i've seen kind
 
08:16:06.310 --> 08:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:08.388 --> 08:16:08.398 align:start position:0%
reaction by claiming that dog club
 
08:16:11.910 --> 08:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
members put a dog in a crate with a hair
 
08:16:13.990 --> 08:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
which scares the hair to death and you
 
08:16:16.548 --> 08:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
know other suggestions of cruel behavior
 
08:16:19.270 --> 08:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
which is absolutely unfounded so i
 
08:16:21.190 --> 08:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to assure you of that i think
 
08:16:23.510 --> 08:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you heard earlier the comment
 
08:16:25.990 --> 08:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
about these clubs are not engaged in any
 
08:16:26.000 --> 08:16:26.948 align:start position:0%
about these clubs are not engaged in any
kind

08:16:26.948 --> 08:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
kind
 
08:16:29.030 --> 08:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
any conduct that would be deemed in
 
08:16:31.590 --> 08:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty in new hampshire state
 
08:16:33.830 --> 08:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
law which covers both domestic and wild
 
08:16:36.310 --> 08:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
animals thank you
 
08:16:38.070 --> 08:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you miss ober any questions for

thank you miss over for your testimony
 
08:16:43.110 --> 08:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in front of the
 
08:16:46.388 --> 08:16:46.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:47.910 --> 08:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
next up is kyle baker of the new
 
08:16:49.430 --> 08:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire wildlife federation in
 
08:16:55.510 --> 08:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:58.868 --> 08:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
you have two and a half minutes sir
 
08:17:00.628 --> 08:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
08:17:03.030 --> 08:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
for having us here today uh kyle baker
 
08:17:04.070 --> 08:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
here with the new hampshire wildlife
 
08:17:05.910 --> 08:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
federation and opposition to this bill
 
08:17:07.350 --> 08:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh most of the points that i want to say
 
08:17:09.430 --> 08:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
have already been covered um again just
 
08:17:10.708 --> 08:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide background that this
 
08:17:12.948 --> 08:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
exact bill came before the fish and game
 
08:17:15.670 --> 08:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
commission um and what they did instead
 
08:17:18.548 --> 08:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
of denying it was struck a compromise uh
 
08:17:20.628 --> 08:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
position last year which which is why we
 
08:17:22.468 --> 08:17:22.478 align:start position:0%
have the new rules in place
 
08:17:24.788 --> 08:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
requiring an independent veterinarian
 
08:17:28.230 --> 08:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
examination of a hair at the club's cost
 
08:17:30.388 --> 08:17:30.398 align:start position:0%
every single year so again we feel that
 
08:17:32.310 --> 08:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
that compromise provides adequate
 
08:17:34.150 --> 08:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
protections for the hairs being held for
 
08:17:36.548 --> 08:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
these activities but we
 
08:17:37.910 --> 08:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all i wanted to say
 
08:17:39.910 --> 08:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer any questions
 
08:17:41.590 --> 08:17:41.600 align:start position:0%

08:18:24.240 --> 08:18:25.030 align:start position:0%
it is one one comment i want to make
about

08:18:25.030 --> 08:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
08:18:26.548 --> 08:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
breeders only being in it for the money
 
08:18:28.230 --> 08:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's a comment made by somebody who's
 
08:18:29.990 --> 08:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
never raised a litter of puppies because
 
08:18:33.910 --> 08:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:36.230 --> 08:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
these dogs have an innate these hounds
 
08:18:37.750 --> 08:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and many other breeds have an innate
 
08:18:40.468 --> 08:18:40.478 align:start position:0%
ability to scent humans smell parts per
 
08:18:43.590 --> 08:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
million dogs do parts per billion
 
08:18:45.030 --> 08:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
they can smell you and tell you your
 
08:18:45.040 --> 08:18:45.990 align:start position:0%
they can smell you and tell you your
mood

08:18:45.990 --> 08:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
mood
 
08:18:46.000 --> 08:18:46.868 align:start position:0%
mood
so

08:18:46.868 --> 08:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:18:48.468 --> 08:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
what does that mean you have a dog here
 
08:18:50.388 --> 08:18:50.398 align:start position:0%
you want it to engage in certain
 
08:18:50.398 --> 08:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
you want it to engage in certain
activities

08:18:51.750 --> 08:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
activities
 
08:18:51.760 --> 08:18:52.548 align:start position:0%
activities
so

08:18:52.548 --> 08:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:18:54.150 --> 08:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
you take that innate ability and you
 
08:18:57.190 --> 08:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
train it um i've trained my dogs with
 
08:18:59.190 --> 08:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
live wild birds that's what they need to
 
08:18:59.200 --> 08:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
live wild birds that's what they need to
do

08:18:59.990 --> 08:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
08:19:01.350 --> 08:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
because that's going to mimic what they
 
08:19:03.910 --> 08:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
do in the field when i'm hunting them
 
08:19:03.920 --> 08:19:04.868 align:start position:0%
do in the field when i'm hunting them
to

08:19:04.868 --> 08:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:19:06.628 --> 08:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
there aren't other ways to do it and you
 
08:19:09.350 --> 08:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
do that early you instill that scent
 
08:19:10.468 --> 08:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
that drive
 
08:19:12.310 --> 08:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
and you have a successful dog you have a
 
08:19:14.230 --> 08:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
dog that's
 
08:19:15.510 --> 08:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned before you have a
 
08:19:16.948 --> 08:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
relationship with that dog they want to
 
08:19:18.310 --> 08:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
please you they want to go get the game
 
08:19:20.388 --> 08:19:20.398 align:start position:0%
and bring it back to you
 
08:19:22.788 --> 08:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
in the off season i take all of my dogs
 
08:19:25.030 --> 08:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
and engage in scent a lot of scent
 
08:19:25.040 --> 08:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
and engage in scent a lot of scent
activities

08:19:26.310 --> 08:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
activities
 
08:19:28.628 --> 08:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
it keeps their mind going it keeps them
 
08:19:28.638 --> 08:19:33.670 align:start position:0%
it keeps their mind going it keeps them
stimulated

08:19:33.670 --> 08:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:35.430 --> 08:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
it improves the quality of life for your
 
08:19:35.440 --> 08:19:36.468 align:start position:0%
it improves the quality of life for your
dogs

08:19:36.468 --> 08:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
08:19:37.990 --> 08:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
08:19:40.788 --> 08:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
not doing so um really it's mismanaging
 
08:19:43.110 --> 08:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
your dog it's mistreating them um you
 
08:19:45.590 --> 08:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
know the 10-minute walk when you go home
 
08:19:47.830 --> 08:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's really insufficient to to keep
 
08:19:50.150 --> 08:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
your dog healthy and active and people
 
08:19:52.150 --> 08:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
have already also addressed here that
 
08:19:54.868 --> 08:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
that human canine bond that's been been
 
08:19:57.670 --> 08:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
around for thousands of years and you
 
08:19:59.350 --> 08:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
instill that by doing things with your
 
08:20:00.868 --> 08:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
dogs and you do things that your dog
 
08:20:02.788 --> 08:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
loves to do and then they love to be
 
08:20:05.670 --> 08:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
with you um and having that
 
08:20:07.190 --> 08:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that bond
 
08:20:09.510 --> 08:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
benefits the dog it also benefits people
 
08:20:11.190 --> 08:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
because there's innumerable studies that
 
08:20:12.310 --> 08:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
will show you
 
08:20:14.868 --> 08:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
the benefit to having a dog the
 
08:20:17.350 --> 08:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
emotional the physical all that stuff
 
08:20:18.468 --> 08:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
having a dog
 
08:20:21.190 --> 08:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
will do for you um i also wanted to to
 
08:20:22.468 --> 08:20:22.478 align:start position:0%
to bring up a topic that hasn't been
 
08:20:25.110 --> 08:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned before it's called epigenetics
 
08:20:27.750 --> 08:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you take a dog and you
 
08:20:30.150 --> 08:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
for wha you do things that are prevented
 
08:20:33.030 --> 08:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
from doing things that it's been bred to
 
08:20:35.910 --> 08:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
do it's been developed to do
 
08:20:37.670 --> 08:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
after three generations that dog won't
 
08:20:39.030 --> 08:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
know how to do that
 
08:20:40.468 --> 08:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
so why would you want to do that to all
 
08:20:42.708 --> 08:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
these specific dogs that have sent
 
08:20:44.548 --> 08:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
hounds and what have you that have
 
08:20:47.670 --> 08:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
been developed over hundreds of years
 
08:20:50.310 --> 08:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
to take care of that
 
08:20:50.320 --> 08:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
to take care of that
um

08:20:51.350 --> 08:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:20:53.270 --> 08:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it for me
 
08:20:56.788 --> 08:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr miller
 
08:21:00.070 --> 08:21:00.080 align:start position:0%

foundation
 
08:21:39.510 --> 08:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
i am here to testify in opposition to
 
08:21:41.670 --> 08:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1308
 
08:21:41.680 --> 08:21:42.628 align:start position:0%
house bill 1308
now

08:21:42.628 --> 08:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
08:21:44.310 --> 08:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
as many of you may already know new
 
08:21:45.990 --> 08:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is known throughout the region
 
08:21:47.750 --> 08:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
for its wide array of hunting
 
08:21:50.150 --> 08:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities many of which rely on the
 
08:21:52.388 --> 08:21:52.398 align:start position:0%
use of well-trained dogs while the field
 
08:21:54.230 --> 08:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
and two such pursuits are rabbit and
 
08:21:56.948 --> 08:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
snowshoe hare hunting in preparation for
 
08:21:58.788 --> 08:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
these seasons a dog is commonly trained
 
08:22:00.868 --> 08:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
over live captured hairs under
 
08:22:02.548 --> 08:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
environments that simulate situations
 
08:22:04.948 --> 08:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
the dog will see in the field
 
08:22:06.628 --> 08:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
the use of these hairs is also an
 
08:22:08.868 --> 08:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
important component to field trials
 
08:22:10.868 --> 08:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
during which a dog's ability to perform
 
08:22:13.270 --> 08:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
under hunting conditions is tested
 
08:22:15.910 --> 08:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
now as someone who has spent countless
 
08:22:18.388 --> 08:22:18.398 align:start position:0%
hours training a hunting dog i can
 
08:22:20.708 --> 08:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
attest to the value and ethics behind
 
08:22:22.628 --> 08:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
preparing your dog for the conditions it
 
08:22:25.030 --> 08:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
will see in the field which includes in
 
08:22:27.590 --> 08:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
my case tracking and retrieving
 
08:22:29.910 --> 08:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
something that cannot be adequately
 
08:22:32.628 --> 08:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
replicated without the use of live game
 
08:22:34.468 --> 08:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
this is something that miss
 
08:22:37.270 --> 08:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
price and mr derosa have discussed and
 
08:22:39.510 --> 08:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
they hit the nail on the head with it
 
08:22:41.350 --> 08:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting the use of wild hairs for
 
08:22:42.628 --> 08:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
training dogs
 
08:22:44.708 --> 08:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
stocking a training site or in field
 
08:22:47.990 --> 08:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
trials house bill 1308 will send under
 
08:22:49.910 --> 08:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
trained and underqualified dogs into the
 
08:22:52.708 --> 08:22:52.718 align:start position:0%

08:22:54.230 --> 08:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
