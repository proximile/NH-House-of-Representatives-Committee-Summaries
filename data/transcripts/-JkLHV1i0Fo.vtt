2025 their general fund allocation is
 
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.710 align:start position:0%
2025 their general fund allocation is
down

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
4% um and that compares with uh like HHS
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%

accountant and I have no discernable
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
Talent just why I'm in the
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
middle um we're going to uh talk to you
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
about who we are and where we spend
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
money and and this is not a preview of
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
what the governor might do because we um
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
if we knew we couldn't tell
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
you um so um if you look at the second
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
or the slide numbered page one I want to
 
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
just mention what what we are and what
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
we aren't um we have more
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
administratively attached boards than
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
anybody in state government and and to
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
remind people what those are because
 
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 align:start position:0%
they're weird there are a bunch of tiny
 
00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
they're weird there are a bunch of tiny
independent

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
agencies that are independent in every
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
way I'm not the boss of them I don't get
 
00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
to tell them what to do um their budget
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
is submitted to you Untouched by us and
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
we don't say anything but because
 
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
they're so little one employee three
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
employees five
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
employees um periodically the
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
legislature will
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
say I want you to do the HR and um the
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
some of the finance back office work for
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
them so we do that and in fact um I'll
 
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
you'll see later we have a
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
position that was given to us because of
 
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
this right right now we have five in
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
2019 there was one so our our spend
 
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
looks like it went up more than it did
 
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
in some reports or didn't go down as
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
much as it
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
did um because of that but now there are
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
five there's a six that's being added
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
the Personnel appeals board and uh
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
Deferred Comp commission may turn out to
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
be a seventh depending on um what the
 
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
where that ends up going in the
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
government structure so anyway that's
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's who we are I'm going to talk to
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
you about Das not about the attach
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
boards so on page
 
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.270 align:start position:0%
boards so on page
two

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
um the chairman stole my
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
thunder and this is I we are the lowest
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
spending agency in state government we
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
went down 7% where everybody else went
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
up something like
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
33% and I'm very proud of that we're
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to talk to you about how that
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
happened and the way in which it
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
happened um a big piece of that is the
 
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 align:start position:0%
retiree Health story which is is
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
something we're very proud of but I I
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
would just say this that if even if you
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to end with the slide too just
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
because I like how it looks and I'm
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
going to post it on my wall um this
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I'm going to send a copy
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
to the governor and everyone else you
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
can think of um so go if you go to page
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
three I I want to I'm going to explain
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
to you how I'm going to talk about our
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
department how we're going to talk about
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
our department our general fund spend
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
and and this is the 25 adjusted
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
authorized spend so it's not as past in
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
the budget it's the number that you'll
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
see in the agency phase budget documents
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
and and as a line item in in the
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
governor's document when that's
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
produced um and it has all the house
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
bill two spending pumped into it because
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
the the the legisl and the governor
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of money in House Bill too
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
including a pay raise but this gives you
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
an idea what we're actually spending and
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
if you look our department is half
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
retire health and half everything else
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
in a really odd way this year it's
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
almost exactly half it's 31 767 and
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
31757 um so we're going to talk first
 
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:30.510 align:start position:0%
31757 um so we're going to talk first
about

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk to you about one of
 
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.390 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk to you about one of
the

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
greatest stories in state government
 
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
greatest stories in state government
right

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
now um know it's a phenomenal success
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
story in terms of uh strategy and
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
spending and it won't always look like
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
this but we're going to take as much
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
credit as we can because so many people
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
did so many good things on it and to
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
tell you about it I'm going to let
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
Cassie talk good morning everyone um
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
Cassie Keen I'm Deputy Commissioner but
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
um more importantly I'm the former
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
director of the division of risk and
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and um when I was director I
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
was in charge of administering retire
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
health benefits we have um over
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
12,500 retirees and spouses on our
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
retiree health plan some of them are
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
what we call non-medicare retirees and
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
there are about 1580 of those and we
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
also have Medicare retirees um
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
10,906 of those um some of you have been
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
here for years and we've been talking
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
about retiree Health you may remember if
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
they're Medicare retirees we bring in
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds to to help mitigate the
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
cost of those Medicare
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
retirees um and so Medicare retirees are
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
much non-medicare retirees are much more
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
expensive to cover than um Medicare
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
retirees for example the premium for our
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
non-medicare is
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
$478 per month um that is because we're
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
self-insured and we pay for the claims
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
individuals um part of the story I'll
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
tell you about U Medicare retirees as we
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
go through the the chart is we we
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
implemented strategies to ensure all are
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
part of the Medicare population and we
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
were able to leverage federal dollars
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
and that's a big um component of the
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
savings that you see here but I was
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
thinking last night as I was reflecting
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
on um my favorite history which is
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
retire health and um I was remembering
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
when I came back to State service in
 
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
2013 and joined Das that one of the
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
first things I had to do um was go to
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and report on retiree
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
health and at the time um what came out
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
of um the budget process was a a a
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
budget that everyone knew was going to
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
squeak if if we were lucky right and so
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
we did an analysis of of the funding and
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
we were able to say to the legislature
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
at that time we're good if I if I if I
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
take into account and and we have grown
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
as we've become as we were self-insured
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we've gotten better and better at
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
managing our health benefit plan that if
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
we if we did our analysis in depth and
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
and um and considered the cost of
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
non-medicare and Medicare back in 2013
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
we we slid by and what I what I thought
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
about that was boy I didn't know what I
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know what was coming at us right
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
so fast forward to 2016
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
and um it retire Health became a huge
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
problem for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
for das and quite frankly for the
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
finance committees okay so what happened
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
was we were in um coming out of the
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
governor's budget we were underfunded
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
for our projected need and then what
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
happens in healthcare happened Pharmacy
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
cost took off there was a 16% inflation
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
rate back then and so all of a sudden we
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
found ourselves in a $10 million
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
um projected deficit situation and that
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
began I think a period of partnership
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
rep rler may recall where we worked very
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
closely with the F the finance committee
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
to um to manage retire health and how we
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
spend the money so that we could meet
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
our statutory obligation which is to
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
administer re retiree health benefits
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
within the funds appropriated by the
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
legislature so in 2016 we worked with
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee there are two ways
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
you can change retire Health um it it is
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
it is legislative action is required so
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
the legis full legislature can do it or
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee can do it fiscal
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't really want that
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility just so you guys know
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
because it's 10 people and they they
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
really felt like shouldn't 400 people be
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
voting on this right so in any event we
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
were trying to solve a short-term
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
problem at that time and what um the
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee decided Ed was to
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
increase premium contributions the
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
amount that the retirees contribute to
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of um their care and at that
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
time the only retiree group that had a
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
premium contribution was the
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
non-medicare group and they had over the
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
years paid a lump sum of 65 bucks it
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
went up to 12 a half% it went up to
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
175% by fiscal Committee Action they
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
also changed some co-pays those are two
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
examples of the levers that we have that
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
we can adjust to meet Our obligation to
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
fund retire Health within the um funds
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the legislature so so in
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
2016 after we completed the fiscal
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
process we knew we knew retire Health
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
was going to be a forever problem if you
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
will right and that we had to manage it
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember this it's um
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
our long-term study on options to adjust
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
the retiree health benefit plan and it
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
goes through uh a myriad of options
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
the pros of them the cons of them Etc
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
and um one of those options in here was
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
considering a Medicare Advantage plan um
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
again this is 2017 and at the time the
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
network for Medicare in New Hampshire
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
was not robust enough to meet Medicare
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
um standards and so coming in um out out
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
of 2017 we were watching this but it
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't an option then at some point in
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
2018 our vendor and Anthem said to us
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
hey we've got the network would you like
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
us to work with you on Medicare
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
Advantage and we said yes and so
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
beginning in
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
2019 where you see the first result in
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
savings what we did was we fully insured
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare retirees for their medical
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
services only right not their Pharmacy
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
we kept the pharmacy self-insured um
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
through our vendor Express Scripts and
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
so for um 19 and 20 and 21 we worked
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
with anthem on Medicare Advantage and we
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
were in a contract we we um amended that
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
contract Etc and then when you look at
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
2022 and you see our that we really
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
really did a great job of savings right
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
through a procurement process we um went
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
out to bid and we um contracted with
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
Etna and we actually achieved a zero
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
premium and you might sit there and say
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
how could you do that right and it was
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
because it was because the vendor atna
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
was relying on the federal reimbursement
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
and they they were counting on that they
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
would meet their costs with the federal
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
money and that they wouldn't have to
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
charge us anything and um so that's
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the other part of the
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
success story you have here right and so
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
um what I what I think I want to say and
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
and some of you have been here for years
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
have heard me say this we're really
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
worried that this Medicare Advantage is
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
our last rabbit to pull out of the Hat
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
you know um and so and so knowing that
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
we were facing sort of uh what what are
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
our future options oh they don't look
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
great we decided to do to experiment one
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
more time and when we went out to bid in
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
late um in in 23 for
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
24 um we we bid in the alternative we
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
bid for uh our Medicare Medicare
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage retirees and we asked the
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
biders to price out just insuring the
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
medical and then we asked them in the
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
alternative price out medical and
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and we were successful in um in
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
in even beating the the rates that we
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
had in the past so when you look back at
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
your chart here and you see
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
2425 it reflects um that contract
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
arrangement 26 is unknown to us and and
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're um we're quite sort of on on pins
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
and needles watching what happens at the
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
federal level so a lot is happening at
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
the federal level right now that none of
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
us really have a crystal ball to figure
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
out but um even earlier in
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
2024 we were hearing um that the federal
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
notices about funding for Medicare
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
Advantage were going to tighten down
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
tighten up the the reimbursement levels
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
so we're watching 26 very carefully
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
again our concern is we're at of rabbits
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so that's the story of our Medicare
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
safe our our um retiree health benefit
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
savings I'm I'm just going to see if I
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
um oh oh do you want me to talk about
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
pering contribution yeah okay one thing
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
I forgot to tell you folks
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
um if you may recall I mentioned earlier
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
2017 the only retirees paying a premium
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
contribution were non-medicare retirees
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
and that really tied our hands in terms
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
of tools because the larger part of the
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
population was paying nothing and so um
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
we worked with governor cunu and his
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
budget officer and for the we introduced
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
and was passed by the legislature a
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
firsttime premium contribution for our
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare population now when you think
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
about Medicare it's important to
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
remember these are older people right
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
they're unfixed incomes Etc I think when
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
I first started um analyzing retiree
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
Health we had two people over the age of
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
100 we now have 21 okay so the
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
population is aging people are living
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
longer and and yeah except when we're
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
paying for retire Health right and so um
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
and so uh by the way passing that
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
premium contribution was difficult
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
politically and um those of you were who
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
were here may remember we worked very
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
hard in particular with representative
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
Ober and we grandfathered um the oldest
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the retirees who had the lowest
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
pensions and so retirees who were born
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
January 1 149 and earlier were
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
grandfathered and today pay nothing
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
toward the premium contribution there
 
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
toward the premium contribution there
are

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
4759 retirees who today do not pay a
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
premium contri bution because of their
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
age um and and as as that group um
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
diminishes the group paying increases
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
and now we have over 6,000 retirees who
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
are paying that 10% premium
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
contribution all right so uh let's have
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
some questions I I think I saw
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ms and then
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
representative rung thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so the
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
these expenditures these are um are
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
these expenditures for claims or are
 
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
these expenditures for claims or are
these

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
um some kind of contribution to some
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
post-retirement liability no no um they
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
are they are to pay for retiree health
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so when we're self-insured we pay
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
the medical claims and the prescription
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
drug claims just give me the bill I pay
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
it right when we're fully insured the
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
carrier taking on the risk and we pay
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
the rate the monthly rate so when we
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
went to when we went to Medicare
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
Advantage for the first time and and
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
ensured that medical portion of the
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
benefit benefit that had a rate
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
Associated that we paid to Anthem the
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
carrier and we self-insured the
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug claims so it includes
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
both self-insured claims and insurance
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
rate okay and problem and then so when
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
you you had mentioned that um when you
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
when we moved to Etna there was a zero
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
premium on the uh on the Medicare um so
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming therefore that a lot of
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
these dollars that are left are are uh
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drug claims and
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
non-medicare expenditures correct okay
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
okay and one one last
 
00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.669 align:start position:0%
okay and one one last
one

00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
um uh what happened to the um the
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
retirees um co-pays and out of-pocket
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
um expenses or maximums when we went to
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage did that increase
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
significantly they all stayed the same
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
again we we have no authority to change
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
it except with action by the legis
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
rung thank you very much um I uh I'm new
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
to this committee so I apologize if you
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
know some of these questions seem pretty
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
basic but so we have a group of retirees
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
who are younger than the Medicare
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility age right younger than I
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
think it's 65 okay how many are there
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
compared to those that are medic
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
medically um Medicare eligible I'm sorry
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
180 nonm Medicare okay and um
 
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.549 align:start position:0%
180 nonm Medicare okay and um
10,906

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
10,906
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare okay um so the the the people
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are um Medicare eligible do they
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
still have to pay their part Fe premium
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming they do okay and
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
so why do we even offer retire why don't
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
they just go on Medicare and then
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps have their own personal choice
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
whether they want to get an advantage
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
plan or a Supplement Plan with separate
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
Part D so I I I think I I'm not exactly
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
sure when when retiree health started
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
but I think it may go back as far as the
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
70s do you know particularly I I think
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
so um for for a lot of large companies
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
and and governments the the you know
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare doesn't cover everything and so
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have a metag gap plan of
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
some kind and a lot of large companies
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
and governments offer it and so this was
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
always an employee benefit and like if
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
you talk to the union um it was sort of
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
bargained or or understood so we've just
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
had it as a as a benefit they could you
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
know people people could uh could buy
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
one themselves but they would kind of
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
rather have us buy it for them so and
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare doesn't pay for all costs so
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of what our plan does is wrap
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
around what Medicare pays and it you
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
most of our retirees pay very little for
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
the healthare compared to the average
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
American um one thing I want to mention
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
for you because I could I I know where
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're coming from I think um one of the
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature has
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
recognized from beginning back in
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
2009 when there were very liberal
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for retire
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
Health right that we needed to um sort
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
of uh contain who who who can be
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for retire health and so um
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the two elements
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
that make up eligibility one's age and
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
one's years of service we we call it
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
credible State service and what it means
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
is that not only are you a state
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
employee but that you are also
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
contributing to the to um the retirement
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
plan the pension plan right um and so
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
over the years it for example I'm
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of group two there used to be
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
no service requirement this is back in
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
the 2000s okay and what we would what
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
what we experienced was there would be
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
group two people who might have worked
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
in municipality their entire career they
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
would come to the state work here for a
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
year or two retire and then the state
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
was paying retire Health that was not
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
rewarding someone for for um dedicated
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
State service and so
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
today um group two eligibility is 52 and
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
a half and 20 years of State service I
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
think and um no 25 I believe and group
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
one eligibility is 6
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
and 20
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
years so when I think of this picture of
 
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:12.510 align:start position:0%
years so when I think of this picture of
managing

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
retiree I have to leave a few minutes
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's okay can so those that
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
are retirement um Medicare eligible and
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
they're on the Medicare Advantage plan
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
there is significant out of-pocket costs
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
on those um you know compared let's say
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare with a supplement does the
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
state cover those out- of pocket costs
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
not not entirely there are and and I'm
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not up on those details like off the
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
top of my head but we do have co-pays
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
for um like physician visits and
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
impatient hospital we have co-pays for
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs we have maximum
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
out of pockets right so they they still
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
do pay and and when going back to your
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
initial question and I forgot to answer
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
one thing you asked me so Medicare
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
retirees do pay A Part B premium it's
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
monthly and it's it's pretty significant
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
um it is um let's see in 24 it was
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
17420 a month and in 25 it's 185 a month
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
right so if again thinking about why did
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
we grandfather people because they're
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
already paying so much for that Medicare
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
Part be by the way go back to the the
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
2000s one of the things the legislature
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
did when it made changes to try and
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
contain costs was to we used to pay for
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
that Medicare Part B premium and so now
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
the retirees pay for it but you asked me
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
a question about that was essentially um
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
why don't we just give them a payment
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
and let them go purchase some kind of
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
Health Care coverage for themselves it
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
actually is one of the options that we
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussed in here and we would use
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
something called a healthcare exchange
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
if that ever came to pass um and
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
essentially what you do is contract with
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
a a a company that works with retirees
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
to counsel them on options for various
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
health care plans right and what what
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
might be what is your employer paying
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
toward the cost of retire health and
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
then you consider what do you want to
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
buy do you want to buy something more
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
expensive you're going to have to reach
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
into your own pocket you want to buy a
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
very lean plan and take the risk okay
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
you can do that you can pocket the money
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
but you're on you're on you're you're at
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
risk so okay all right thank you um
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
would you mind leaving your card can I'd
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
like to follow up sure okay thank you
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
very much representative wer thank you
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations commissioner that's that
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
was a big change and fiscal is always
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
willing to help when you come up with
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
new ideas thank you the only thing I
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
want to comment on I have a good friend
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
that's a retired uh state employee with
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes and he keeps complaining to me
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
every time I see him about Caroline oh
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
he said what a lousy contractor they are
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
I hope you're going to get rid of them
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
what's what's the um changes there if so
 
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.350 align:start position:0%
what's what's the um changes there if so
so

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start by saying um we go
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
out to bid we choose the lowest bidder
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
as long as they meet technical
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
requirements um if anyone in this room
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
thinks that um carry that contractors
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
let alone insurance carriers do what
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
they they should do without intervention
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
by us you're wrong okay so we have a
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
history I think in Risk benefits of
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
really working closely with our vendors
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure they deliver the services
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
to our members whether they're active
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
employees and families or retirees so
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
this year when we went out to bid Anthem
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
won the contract back from uh Etna and
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um they uh they snookered us a little
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
all right they did not disclose to us
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
that they were implementing their own
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Benefit Management subsidiary
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
PBM okay and um we moved our retires
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
to um car to Anthem and Caroline was the
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
subsidiary right and um and they stink
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
and and they were not ready yes they
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
stunk they couldn't have stunk more
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
quite frankly it it became chaos it was
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
very problematic for our retirees for
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
the governor for the legislature for the
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
executive Council for the legislature
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
there was a ton of abrasion right and so
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
we worked we worked very very closely
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
with Anthem um to fix the issues we
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
assessed performance guarantees and
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
collected over $2 million in performance
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees because of their um inability
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
to perform we stopped payment for a
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
period of six months until they be until
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
they fixed it right so I think our
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
monthly premium was 1.8 million we did
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
not pay them okay um we then uh worked
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
with a third-party auditor to audit the
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
carolon pharmacy
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
processes and um to make sure first of
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
first and foremost that people get their
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
medicine right um but did they get the
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
right customer service and I I kind of
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
feel like if you went down okay are they
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
filling prescriptions are they are they
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
answering the phone are they giving
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
accurate information when you answer the
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
phone it would be
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
like right and we had to get them to
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
check check check right so we worked
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
with them very intensely over six months
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm very proud to say that often we
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
say we teach these companies how to do
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
business okay and so um and so that is
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
what we did with Caroline and we've come
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
out the other end it's not perfect it
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
never is customer service quality
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
customer service is a huge challenge out
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
there okay so so we still have to
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
intervene but it's so much better thank
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
you you you could have gone to Express
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
Scripts instead or stayed with Express
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
SCP well remember we fully insured the
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs so we could get the
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
savings and this is the risk what
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
happens when you switch
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
vendors it's risky you know you're
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
always waiting and wondering how' it go
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
how' it go right and um and
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it couldn't have gone
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
worse all right represent a evil yeah I
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
just have a really easy quick question I
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
think how often do you go out to bid
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
annually or for the banum no we tend to
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
go out to bid um usually for three-year
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
period and and often we include
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions to extend up for two
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
additional years um so uh it it's
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient to test the market by the way
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
we we work with our medical consultant
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we know that that's a good interval
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
so the contract that we're in right now
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
started will end when um let's see
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh calendar end of calendar 26 yes yes
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so the the details of the plan
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
are in law is that correct I mean in the
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
sense that the 20 years and the copay
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and some of these other things or so so
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the co you're not
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
going to find the copays the max out of
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
pockets and all that stuff in the law
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't change it without coming
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
to the legislature we have no authority
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
to do it um and were we to do that I
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
think we'd have to work in Partnership
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about just how much detail did
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
you want in the law and figure that out
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
so there's no requirement that it be any
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
particular level I mean in terms of
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
contractual requirements with the
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
employees no the only legal requirement
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
is that the retire health benefits are
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
administered within the funds
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the legislature I see
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
but historically the state has paid for
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
reti health sure but the the point is
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature could say we want to put
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
100 million into this or 90 or 80 and
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
you could work out absolutely the
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
details to make yes ends meet yeah yes
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay and and and retire I just do want
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
to say the retirees are are experienced
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
state employees and they know how to um
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
be advocates for themselves of course
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative mths thank you thank
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
you just as a followup to that so there
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
so there is nothing in any of the
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
contracts that the state has with its
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
employees that governs retire health no
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
no requirement that has to be offered so
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
so retire health is I let me ask answer
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
your question this way it is not
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
law if it if it comes down to it there
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different levers you could
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
push and we could help um show you the
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
menu so you knew what you might be
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
pushing what is this book you're waving
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
around this is the long-term study from
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
2016 from early 2017 when we had a
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
crisis and it's basically the actuar
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
saying you could do this or you could do
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
that this is this is why it's a good
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
idea this is why it's a bad idea gotta
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
sure right thank you um other questions
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
on retire health no all right let's go
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
on okay plant and property slide six if
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
you will um I'm discussing this
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
separately because it's a different
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
thing in terms of how we budget
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
um much like doit the maintenance of
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
buildings is something every agency
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
who's in a building pays
 
00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
for there's a class 28 in their budget
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
and then the spend the the the
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
electricians the the the the work is in
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
our budget it's half of the rest of our
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
budget but it's very little general
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
funds it's 52 million in total funds and
 
00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
6 million in
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
general because we build the other
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
agency so I'm going to use use one
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
example we do all the court
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
buildings and the the judicial branch
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
pays us about $1 million a
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
year General funds out of their budget
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
non-general funds in our
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
budget um we have 92 state buildings
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
including cour
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
houses we don't do any building where
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
people stay overnight on
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
purpose like uh Corrections New
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
Etc um we we don't do ouses in the Parks
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
or the bathouses or things like that and
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
we don't do the mil Military
 
00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.109 align:start position:0%
we don't do the mil Military
Reservation

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
Reservation
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
so mostly we do Office Buildings mostly
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
in conquered we have about four between
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
four and 5 million square feet of office
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
space and conquered
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
Alone um so occasionally we refer to
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
people in buildings as tenants I would
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
never describe the legislature that
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
way um but and sometimes the the charge
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
is called rent but it's really an
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
allocated portion of the uh maintenance
 
00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
allocated portion of the uh maintenance
cost

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.430 align:start position:0%
cost
generally

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
um we do as much as we can to take care
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
of the buildings as best we can and and
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the operative word is
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
triage um if we had an accurate deferred
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance list in the state it would
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
be about a billion dollars give or
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
take um and we're going to do two to
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
four million of that a year
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
so it obviously doesn't have to be that
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
accurate um but it it it just G gives
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
you a sense we're we're trying to do
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
more and we we every day think of new
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
ways to do things and are we you know
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
are cleaning contracts working better
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
than part-time building cleaners and
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes the market dictates that
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's dictated by who you can
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
get uh we actually have an enormous
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
amount of success right now with with um
 
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.950 align:start position:0%
amount of success right now with with um
own

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
staff mostly part-time building cleaners
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them happen to be in
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
conquered and from the refugee
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
communities um which works well
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
because people talk to each other and we
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
treat them
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
nicely and that's how you get people you
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
know where you should apply and so we
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
like that so that's plant and
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
property and that's that's the big piece
 
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.550 align:start position:0%
property and that's that's the big piece
of

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
it oh there's a general fund component
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
to plant and property and it
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's we don't actually charge everybody
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
so the judicial branch is charged the
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
legislative branch is not and that shows
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
up as general funds the governor's
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
office is not charged that shows up as
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
general funds we don't actually Bill
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves except in a couple of small
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
cases because it would look weird um
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
although frankly I kind of think we
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
should but it would be a weird
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
accounting thing but so that's where you
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
see General funds and then non-state
 
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.430 align:start position:0%
see General funds and then non-state
enti

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
enti
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
the legion we're required to give office
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
space to that's budgeted as general
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
funds um Humanities Council volunteer
 
00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
funds um Humanities Council volunteer
New

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and somebody else I'm not
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
thinking of but anyway so that's the
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
general funds and then a very small
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
component in that division is uh the
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
state energy management office which is
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
100% General funds and Grant income so
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
is maybe this is an LBA question is is
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
this class 28 money um part of the
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
double counting money that's like doit
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
good it's the second biggest source of
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
double counting in the state gotcha
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you um uh so
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
we spent an awful lot of time uh two
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
years ago talking about the new
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage and the move
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
over to
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
um the I'm drawing like on what's the
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
name of the place Gran Place yeah right
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
Gran Granite place
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
um from a uh and it was it wasn't a
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget item it came through here
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
so I feel leg legitimate talking about
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
it how how's all could you just let us
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
know how that's going expenditure wise
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
um we bought Granite place the new doj
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
and agricultur is there and judicial
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
Council um and it got fixed
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
up um at a cost quite nicely if you've
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
been there probably the nicest State
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
Building um and that's not the standard
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
we put in most of our buildings but we
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
did there um so we now own it um we
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
bought it um six months ago I don't even
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
know anymore six eight months ago we
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
bought it we leased it briefly and then
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
bought it um so if you go over there we
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
own one Tower and we don't own the other
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
so um which is fine I'm not advocating
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the big hole on the ground over
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
there there
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
um it's going well it's um it it uh
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
right now it's as best as works so
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
before the Bank building that was doj
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
was there in
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
1958 um there was a school which is why
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's called School Street apparently and
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
a church and they buried them and uh and
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
when you dig up a site today the rules
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
for taking care of asvestas are slightly
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
different than they were in
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
1958 and slightly more expensive than
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
they were then so we've been doing
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
remediation there's drilling you might
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
have seen a whole bunch of granite that
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
was uncovered that all had to be taken
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
out washed and uh sold to somebody
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
who had use for it I don't know what it
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
was but um and so that's almost done and
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
we should be we should be pouring
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
footings for the garage um in a few
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
months and when we do it will go up
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
quickly it's like an Erector Set that's
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
sort of pre-assembled somewhere else and
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
then you come in and go and it goes up
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
so it it's going well and it's and it's
 
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.790 align:start position:0%
so it it's going well and it's and it's
within

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
budget yeah so
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
um so then the legislature is still
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
planning on on moving over to the other
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
Tower it's the other Tower we're going
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
to at Granite place and are those all
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislative funds that are paying for
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
that or yes and not it's not we're not I
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
mean we're invol in the sense that we
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
help but it's uh it's your money right
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
okay and it's because of work being done
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
here and you'll go over there and then I
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
think a little bit of the second floor
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the annex and then store to the
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
construction zone so and then as soon as
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
the new legislative parking G What's the
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
timing on the store Street uh stores is
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
a decision that will be made after
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
everything else is done okay I think
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
when there's a new garage
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
the pathetic old garage will come down
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a cost to that right and
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be a decision
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
that um bigger heads than mine will make
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you all right go ahead okay so I'm
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to talk about spending I'm
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to let Sherry who I think
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
is stopped coughing um go over our
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
spending by division and she's going to
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
talk to you about you know where we
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
spend and this is the non-plant property
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
non- retire Health quarter of our budget
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then she'll show
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
you um what went up and what went down
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
over the last six years so the next two
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
slides okay thank you good morning Sher
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
Rockburn assistant commissioner for the
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
department so slide seven is looking at
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
a snapshot today so fiscal
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
25 how does our department look in terms
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
of total funds and general funds so not
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
comparing to any trends of History just
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
a snapshot today where we spend our
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
money and within our department we have
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
about eight divisions so these are the
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
spend dollars by our divisions so talk a
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
little bit about our Commissioner's
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
Office commissioner's office um is not
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
just the three of us and you might think
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
if it was I may not be
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
here um but the commissioned office
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
includes um think about the the general
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
operations of a department so it
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
includes our HR department our business
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
office the state budget office is within
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
there um legal assistance is in there
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
proper and um um project management so
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
all of the sort of basic functions of
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
running a department are within that
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
that area
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
um accounting services that is our
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide Accounting Office so our state
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
comproller is the director of accounting
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
services they work primarily on
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
producing the audited um AER annual
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report that
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
office has um and payroll and payroll so
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
the next biggest piece of that is that
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
processes all the payroll for um state
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
employees so there's a payroll component
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
of that office it's the financial
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
reporting it manages all federal
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
reporting so federal government
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide um reporting comes out of that
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
area um as well as an internal or I say
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
an internal audit function but we look
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
at every payment voucher travel vouchers
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
things like that that also happen
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide so as we go through this what
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
you'll start to see is all the other
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
divisions within our department we're
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
really a central Service Agency so every
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
other agency touches ours through um
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
these divisions that I'm going to be
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
talking about so accounting services one
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
where every payment voucher gets um over
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
a certain dollar gets audited all the
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
payroll goes through that that area as
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
well you'll notice most of our divisions
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
as you start to see them is almost 100%
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
generally funds General funded uh Public
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
Works takes care of we build um we build
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
everything except for roads and bridges
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
which happened with Department of
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation so that office staffs um
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
Architects Engineers project management
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
so every construction project that it's
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state is managed by the
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
public works office and that's an area
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
where you'll notice that we have not
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
quite % General funds so where we can we
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
build other state agencies for the
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
oversight of those projects most of the
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
projects that they oversee are capital
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
projects um there are some smaller
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
projects that might get put in a regular
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
house bill one operating budget and we
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
manage manage that the RSA requires that
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
anything over 25,000 shall be managed by
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
the department um sorry the division of
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
Public Works there's a few waiver
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for that there's a few
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
exceptions military fairs fishing games
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
parks and Parks dncr can manage their
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
own projects and there's more we didn't
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
want to go in detail on every little
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing we do as an agency and there's an
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
appendix which has every Division and it
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
includes some metrics for what exactly
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
they do but if you have any questions on
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
in in these various areas and we have
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
that in a few more slides okay so stay

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
positions their classifications do we
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
want to do a reclassification of a
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
position all of that flows through our
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
department of personnel you'll notice no
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of gap between
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
total funds and general funds and what
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
that represents is our Bureau of
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
Education and Training we offer training
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities both the state employees
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and those outside of the state the
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the state is primarily
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities but there's a training
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
program at a cost uh that we charg for
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
those training opportunities and then a
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
few years ago we stood up what was
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
called the HR suu human resource support
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
and for agencies that are small that
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a robust human resource um
 
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.630 align:start position:0%
don't have a robust human resource um
office

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
those agencies can work with us and we
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
will manage that for them and we do a we
 
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
charge back um costs for that it's just
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
more of an allocation of our own staff
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
um but they may not be able to staff a
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
director of HR and two or three staff
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
and so they share um in that cost for us
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
to manage that for
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
them would it make sense to do that for
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
the whole All State departments and have
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
a call center and all that sort of stuff
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a big question and
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the answer I'm going to
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
give you is maybe
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
um when we looked at this there's a
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's an argument for centralizing and
 
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.829 align:start position:0%
there's an argument for centralizing and
decentralizing

00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
decentralizing
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
and the state's experience with
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
centralizing is the shared services
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
Center for AP and uh it went badly it
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
was just
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
everybody uh loan uh gave employees to
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
it that they would rather not
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
have and it did okay and it but it was
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh not as cost effective as people would
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
have hoped I don't know if HR would be
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
like that we we created the hru because
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a hybrid that for small
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
agencies it makes perfect sense now
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
we've recently added the judicial branch
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
which is not a small agency and so we're
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
experimenting with that and so I would
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
say I don't know I feel like HHS may
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
always have its own HR I mean h HHS has
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
more HR than
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
dop and so you've got 3,000 employees or
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
four and so the small ones definitely
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
and everybody I don't know I don't know
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
money and then the last two to talk
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
about plant property as commission o h
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
already already spoke about um
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
procurement and support services that's
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
really our our purchasing department
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
we manage contracts Statewide for
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
Commodities and that flows through that
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
office that office also helps manage the
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
contracts for sometimes what we call
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
single agency um services and contracts
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
so an agency will use our office as
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
assistance for something that might only
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
serve that one agency but most of the
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
work that goes through that office ends
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
up being Statewide contracts um and then
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
part of that office also includes our
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
purchase um sorry our plant and property
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
us white Farm as you think about it so
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
Surplus property
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh that is part of that office we have a
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
food surplus um division um in our mail
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
room graphic services so the non General
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
funds in that comes from a very small
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
amount a few hundred thousand of federal
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
money in our federal food program uh
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
graphic Services that's our charge to
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
other agencies mail room once again we
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
charge other agencies for the mail
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
services and um Surplus property self
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus property self-funded through
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
auction uh twice year so that's where
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
from thanks um so did I hear correctly
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
that um that you that uh you that you do
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
not handle procurement for All State
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
agencies it's just again it's the
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
smaller ones Sim similar to what you do
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
with HR
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
um similar but different um all legally
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
all Commodities have to go through
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing through US of any size so you
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
know I go to council with like eight
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
aggregate contracts that are technically
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
only used by
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
dot um but so all Commodities on service
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
contracts if it is a single agency
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
contract and it's
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
just um I'm hiring a carpenter to only
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
work on my building that an agency can
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
do itself if it's a Statewide contract
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
where we've determined that you're doing
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
it and you're doing it
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
we do a we do a global contract for the
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
state like like office supplies for
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
example is one of them that's more of a
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
commodity but service contracts that
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
everybody uses computer service
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
contracts so the idea is to is for bulk
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
purchasing I mean when it was created a
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
100 years ago it was to make sure that
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
various institutions bought together and
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's still the broad principle so some
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
of our contracts are
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
huge to follow up on um on the on the
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
chair's question about HR Services would
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
it make sense to
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
completely consolidate or centralize
 
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
completely consolidate or centralize
procurement

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
it it might um I would say this
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we can't take it on with the staff
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
we have and that's why single agencies
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
were let uh were allowed to purchase
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
themselves I I think there would be some
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
advantages to it because we would have
 
00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:49.390 align:start position:0%
advantages to it because we would have
more

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
consistent um we bid everything cuz
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's why we were created and not every
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
agency does and so that that would be an
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
advantage but I just want to warn you
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
that it would require staff and most
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
agencies except HHS don't have dedicated
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily contract or purchasing staff
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
so getting there um would be involved
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
at so just when you think you know it
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
all no I'm kidding um so you do actually
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
the Commodities purchasing for for do
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
for salt for aggregate for and so you
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
com they tell you sort of what you need
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then you do the bidding for it and
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
everything the way we buy everything is
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
that an expert develops a spec right the
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
specifications that they have to follow
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
salt is easier although more complicated
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
than you might think certainly more
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
complicated than I thought yeah it is uh
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
water content and things and then then
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
we bid and typically like on all
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
aggregate contracts dot is involved
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
heavily um but we do the purchasing and
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
usually in close contact with them but
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah uh uh by law Commodities all have
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
to be bid by us okay and then I have a
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
another question so the Enterprise
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
application management um you it's
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire first so is that
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
like I mean because I was having a
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
communication with folks from Bea they
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about New Hampshire first
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
is that a little bit I mean I know it
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
has a HR you mentioned aspect but does
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
that like the old one stop where
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
businesses could go and or you know it's
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's more like it's an Erp it's an
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
Enterprise platform and so if you think
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
about large companies mediumsized
 
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.309 align:start position:0%
about large companies mediumsized
companies

00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
have one computer system that runs all
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
of their stuff so it all talks to each
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
other but it's HR it's payroll it's
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
Finance it's budget it's um it's
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
everything and so it is the primary
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism that every Finance person in
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
the state uses every HR person in the
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
state uses and every purchasing person
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
uses it all goes through that it's also
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
undergoing a a very significant upgrade
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
to the cloud it's an upgrade and we're
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
going to the cloud and it's but it is
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
the it is the computer backbone of the
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
operation of state government and and it
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
often referred to as an Erp okay so it
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
has nothing it's not like one stop at
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
all so even though he used that term
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's unrelated yeah correct and it may
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
be that they were referring to so for
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
example every single um payment to a
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
vendor is going to get uh paid through
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first so they'll log on
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
they'll put their invoices in charge
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
think about is every payment whether
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
it's AP or payroll that gets charged
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
against the state budget goes through
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
that system so that system is loaded
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
with the budget as payments happen
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
against it it'll check for Budget
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
compliance are you going to overspend or
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
not that it's very specific class line
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
that all is flowing through that system
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
so the entire budget is in there think
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
of it as a very very very robust
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
QuickBooks you know think about people
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
soft um Oracle think about those types
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
of products that's what that is um our
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
current vendors in for um is the product
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
um the underlying product um Cloud Suite
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
is their their software their brand ship
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
name so that's what that system is it
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.910 align:start position:0%
name so that's what that system is it
doesn't

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
process um so Bea or gopher in terms of
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
arpa they used a separate system to
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
process applications for the Main Street
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
program that did not run through the
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
system so agencies have subsystems that
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
they might use for application purposes
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of applying for let's say a
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
grant or something like that that is
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
sort of outside the system but if you
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
think about every payment that is
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
happening and every collection Revenue
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
collection that's coming in is going to
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
funnel through there really to produce a
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide set of books Statewide
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
Financial so you think about your your
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
revenues your expenses you know in terms
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
of regular company all of that's going
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
to flow through the system so just one
 
00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
other question um so we heard some just
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
on the iCloud migration I was on public
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
works for a really long time so I
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
remember a lot of the um original
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
software um purchases came through the
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget and then there was
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
licensing and all that stuff we heard
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
from Dr also that they're going to start
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
migrating to the cloud are you
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
considering that migration and then once
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
you're on the cloud the co related cost
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
operating costs I I mean is any of that
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
going to be reflected that we're going
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
to be talking about I mean and and this
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
may affect other agencies obviously
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see in in a later slide that that
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
we received arpa money to to to buy the
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
new implementation so to speak um I
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
think $15 million it's coming up and so
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
there's a capital component of the
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade of going to the cloud and all of
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
that the operating costs have always
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
been the the license if you will right
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
have always been in in the deem budget
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and still are are they going to go
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
up yeah cuz it's computers and I don't
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
know who got a hold of that but they go
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
up all the time Microsoft will get your
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
money one way or another but um but the
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
operating costs are there the the agency
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
operating costs are are there aren't
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
additional costs to them corre it's only
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
to us in in the implementation if they
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
have a subsystem that has to inter
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
interface into the system which they're
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
not supposed to and so if you do you
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
have to interface um they may have
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
development costs of redoing an
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
interface think of liquor for example um
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
but the operating costs are all in our
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
budget yeah 100% in our budget as
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
general funds we don't allocate that
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
cost back out to State agencies so we
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
pay that entire Bill ourselves well and
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
we'll have doit in here but I know that
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
there going to more of a subscription
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
model and there's there's a lot of stuff
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
going on yeah that's what this is too
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
when the the old system the on-prem
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
system is is going to not be supported
 
00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
system is is going to not be supported
in

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
right well they said by the end of 24
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
but they're still supporting it so we'll
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
see okay you mentioned liquor are they
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
still um the gating item to finish the
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
end of the year report is that how's
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
that going are they still so liquor
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
didn't give you data for the end of the
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
year report their audit wasn't finished
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
or something right so lior's audit is so
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
I think there's a fiscal committee
 
00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:33.430 align:start position:0%
I think there's a fiscal committee
meeting

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at which we will we have an
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
item requesting an extension of our
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
extension because we don't have liquor
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
and liquor is such a is a material piece
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
of the state books that our Auditors
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
have said if you don't have liquor you
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
can't have an opinion and that would be
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
bad really
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
really bad so um realistically we do
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
March okay so I'd like to turn over the
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
next slide uh slide eight this is now
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
looking at comparing our department so
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
funding 25 our current budget back to 19
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
and this is not set up by division I did
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
this one by our spend the type of spend
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
that's happening so if you look at the
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
bottom where it has the total
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
um in total we went up um about 2% total
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
funds so the general fund numbers at the
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
very bottom you'll see that but the the
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
gray section that says 152 150 2.3
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
million is our total fund increase from
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
19 to 25 and you'll see some significant
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
ups and downs in that so why overall we
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
went up 2% our salary and benefits alone
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
went up 31% in the next slide you'll
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
start to see our position counts
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
positions um change by about 14
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
positions over that six-year period so
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
quite flat so relatively flat that
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
increas is not the result of adding 30%
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
worth of positions uh most of that is
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
really the um significant pay raise that
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
occurred last year uh 10 10 and 2% but
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh so 9.7 million of an increase in
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
salary benefits um the other areas just
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
to point out so current expense think
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
about a lot of your operations one of
 
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
the big changes there that you'll um
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
that is going up there is we changed the
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
way we Bill and account for our mail
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
room so we previously it was more of a
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
net number because we Bild agencies so
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of all our postage was net
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
against the revenue that we charged
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
agencies um in the budget a few years
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
ago we had changed that from 19 so now
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
it shows the actual postage cost and
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
then the revenue coming in from State
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
agencies so net it's a zero zero number
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of that but the budgeting
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
presentation just looks a little bit
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
different there um our next era
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
utilities so Electric gas Etc um that
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
has surprisingly gone up a little bit
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
since 2019 um 1.8 million I will note
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
that we do have a footnote in our budget
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
that if we do not have funds
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated to sufficiently cover our
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
utilities we can go to fiscal for an
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh we don't do that often
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
but that is a um a footnote um that is
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
available to us if we need that um
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the next line and um
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
represent rire you had asked about the
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
027 so class 27 you refer to so our
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
class 27 that we paid doit um almost
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
doubled since 2019 so that's where that
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
is we don't have control over that
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
number that's their our share of their
 
01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:38.349 align:start position:0%
number that's their our share of their
their

01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
budget okay um our next one down
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
equipment um and that one went um well
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
not significant in terms of total you
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
know total dollars it it had a
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
significant increase and that was
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
primarily the result of the annex and
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
downtown Renovations that are occurring
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
we needed to
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
um relocate staff out of the annex to
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
mostly main building and another state
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
office uh Pillsbury building in order to
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
do the renovation in the annex so we
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
moved as many people out as we could but
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
we needed to staff and uh equip those
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
offices in those areas so that cost was
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
there to help with that relocation of
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
staff and to also start to um purchase
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
some equipment for that for the actual
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
Annex itself um that project is very
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
much in its early stages of renovation
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
if you've been over we you walk under
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
scaling and things like that so that's
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
where that increase occurs this software
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
line this is um what we were just
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
talking about this is where we pay for
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
primarily our contract so you'll notice
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
that um there is a a slight increase
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
that occurred so software costs are
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
always going up the 26 27 that million
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
does grow when we move into the
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
subscription based um and I it grows to
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
about two
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
million um and we have a 30
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
I forget the 30-year contract with them
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
sort of looking at Charlie it's 20 I
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
think it's 15 15 sorry sry 15E um but
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's about so that'll will go up for
 
01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's about so that'll will go up for
that

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
subscription the maintenance and
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds so this um had a
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
significant increase for um this is all
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
the work that we do to maintain all the
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
buildings in the state in
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
200 uh
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
2021 an RSA was passed to charge
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
agencies 7 5 cents a square foot for
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
their office space so we could put money
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
into a non-aps deferred maintenance fund
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
um it has just a few million dollars in
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Harry very big balance it's
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
about 1.2 million a year that goes into
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
that but that is um to help with the
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
triage um if there's emergencies so that
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
is really the one of the big increases
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
between the two years is we had a new
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance fund and the cost
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
of doe business is going up and we
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
invest as much as we can in terms of our
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
our buildings if the legislature gives
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
us six million we're going to do the
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
best to to triage if we have 1 million
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
we'll do the best so it's very um very
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
driven in terms of our budget and how
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
much we can do so in uh 2425 we had a
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
little extra that came our way and we we
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately worked with
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
that the but we do better at 6.7 than we
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
do at
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
3.2 as we say uh less buckets for leaks
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
the more we have um I'm going to talk
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
about the consultant and the contract
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
line in tandem with each other because
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
the million dooll increase about 7 to
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
900,000 of that increase is standing up
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
um paid family medical leave and Cassie
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
U is going to talk about that in a few
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
slides that was a brand new program that
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
came into play it's one of the few new
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
general fund programs that we've had in
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
our department and so we have a
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
consultant component of that new program
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
and a contract line that was helping
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
with um impl ation database website
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
marketing so most of that increase is
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
related to that program we'll talk a
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more but it was it's 100%
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
generally funded um it's about a million
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
dollar program so that was the increase
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
of increases Property and Casualty um
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
went down about 4.8 million over that uh
 
01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.230 align:start position:0%
went down about 4.8 million over that uh
six-year

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
period represent thanks uh I'm I'm also
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
one of the newbies in this committee so
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
bear with me um the difference between
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
um total funds and general funds um I
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
understand that there's you know a lot
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
of that as like fees Etc is there some
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a Reconciliation that you have
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
that just says that explains where that
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
extra 90 million is coming from I can um
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
we can we can do one but let me give you
 
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
a sort of a snapshot retiree Health half
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
of the money is General funds and half
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
of it is self-funded state agencies
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
premium contributions and then a couple
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
of other fees like the like the medical
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
subsidy in the retirement system that we
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
charge so on that half of the
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget on plant and property it's all
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
money we charge other agencies the
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the six and the
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
52 that will show up in the budget as
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
agency income and it's what we charge
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
the agency for their their rent so to
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
speak the third biggest component is um
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
procurement and support services
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing purchasing is almost entirely
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
generally funded except for pecard
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue that is to say credit card usage
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue the other four units of that
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
division Surplus property almost
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
entirely federally funded graphic
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
Services um it's it's a few million
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
dollars and it's agency fees if you if
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
you do photoc copying or printing and we
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
do it for you you get charged if you
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
don't you don't um s Surplus property
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's agency income you they they
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
sell stuff you know that agency dispose
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
of what's the fourth oh the mail room
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
which is about 1.8 1.9 million is is we
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
charge agencies the mail room operates
 
01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.029 align:start position:0%
charge agencies the mail room operates
on

01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
the difference between first class mail
 
01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.670 align:start position:0%
the difference between first class mail
rate

01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.750 align:start position:0%
rate
and

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
sorting we take mail and we sort
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
it and you get a slight discount between
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
whatever stamps cost now I don't even
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
know anymore right 89 cents three three
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
bucks um and the little bit of money you
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
save that Arbitrage pays for the mail
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
room for the state so so so a lot of it
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
is you know kind of funny money because
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's an offset someplace else in the
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
budget that's for the plant
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's very much that it's double counted
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
Y for the other things it's it's a yeah
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit of that agencies pay if
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
they do it and don't if they don't right
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't have retirees you don't pay
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
retiree Health if you don't do Graphics
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
you don't pay graphic
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
fees we we can provide a a little bit
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
more detail but
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
there's probably I'm G to say maybe a
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
million or two but we don't really have
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
any M that comes from outside of the
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
state itself so if you think of the
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
state as one big box a lot lot of it is
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
moving around we're charging other
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
agencies very little like a few hundred
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
thousand is coming from federal grants
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
I'll do a you know but we can give the
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
detail we'll do a we'll do a cheat sheet
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
but like I said so there most of it is
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
within the state as opposed to a direct
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
to um an outside other than surplus food
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
you know y so you said um this Paid
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Leave thing is about a
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
million a year um it looks like there's
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of overhead on this right
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
this 300,00
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
consultant or whatever y so let's let's
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
move into that let me just do oh okay
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
you want yeah so one I let me do this
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
one so you Mr chairman you wanted three
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
things from us I think arpa funding what
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
do we do with that new programs which is
 
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.189 align:start position:0%
do we do with that new programs which is
pfml

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
pfml
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
and and positions and that's what we're
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
going to do next quickly three slid so
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
just really really quick represent blman
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
have a question first yeah he does thank
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
good good to see you all so going back
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
to plant buildings Etc I was over in the
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
gallon Park just a day or two ago and I
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
noticed there's still a number of
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
decaying sadl looking buildings what are
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
we doing with
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
them um I can tell you what we're doing
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
with each of them but broadly um so the
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
one the kind of Victorian looking one
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
next to the main building is the main
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
building the oldest building a little
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
building and then a kind of Victorian
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
looking bankr we stabilized if we ever
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
get money in the capital budget we're
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
going to fix it but right now we've
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
stabilized it so it doesn't turn into
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
Laconia the the things on the back of
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
the main building like the Kent wing for
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
example is so far gone it looked it cuz
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
it looked like all the windows have been
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
we don't let anyone in and and I I
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
toured it like six years ago and someone
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
said don't look around look down and if
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
the floor looks like it'll cave in it
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
will and and um the problem is the
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget has $120 million in it
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
and if I want 2.6 million to tear down a
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
building everyone says call me next year
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
and so we're doing the best we can but
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
um mostly we're just trying to to take
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
stuff off to make them safe okay thanks
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so the next arpa yeah so the
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
next slide which is our arpa funding and
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
then I'll turn it over to Cassie for the
 
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
pfml we can talk about that we received
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
um about 75 million in arpa funding and
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
it it was for onetime use and most of
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
our 75 million you can look at as
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
onetime construction we received about
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
33 million that was HVAC related for our
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
buildings and then a a second bucket of
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
money for deferred maintenance so we
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
split it really between HVAC systems
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
versus everything else going on with the
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
buildings um that was U most of the
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
money that weeded for arpa and those
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
project projects that were ongoing so
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
this money has been 100% committed um
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
and obligated before December 31st um a
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago that was the arpa deadline
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
and then those projects some of them are
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
completely done some of them are in the
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
works and we have until December of 26
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the arper program to make sure those
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
are fully spent so that was where that
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
occurred there's no additional General
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
funds or ongoing costs associated with
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
those um the second bucket we received
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
was uh as commissioner Charlie Al had
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned was for our New Hampshire
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
first that's our Erp system 15 million
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
of the upgrade this is not for ongoing
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
operations this was really the
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
implementation and the upgrade from um
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
the last time we had done anything was
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
um many many years ago so this was
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
working with the vendor um to upgrade
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
that system to the latest
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
platform okay and then the last piece on
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
very small dollars but very very
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
important was we set up a Statewide
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
recruitment unit in the division of
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
personnel and what we realized uh
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
especially in the pandemic era and
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
coming out of that
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
is just saying that there's a state job
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
and the state's really great to work for
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough to recruit um skilled and
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
qualified workers you know I think for a
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
very long time it was a um it didn't
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
need marketing on its own um people came
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
to the state for great quality of life
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and great health benefits and as the
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
market really changed and the workforce
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
changed at the start of the pandemic we
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
realized the the criticality of trying
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain a Workforce so this this was
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
money that was stood up um and what we
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
used for it primarily was um I'll call
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
it uh platforms or tool kits uh indeed
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
um things like that um Lin LinkedIn
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
handshake handshake so I didn't even
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
know about handshake Char and I talked
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
about is is
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh know what they are I'm proud of we
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
were like is monsters still exist but
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know so we were dating ourselves a
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
little with the with the the things is
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
coming in so this was a program um in
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this arpa um HHS
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health andar had gone out
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
to ask for arpa money to stand up a
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment unit just for them and I
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
want I believe it was at a fiscal
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee they asked us to work together
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
to stand up a Statewide unit so it
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't just one agency so that's what
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
that unit became um and so that's that's
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
what's happening there um in terms of
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
where does it go in the future and what
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
we tried to do is our division of
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
personnel has always had staff to to
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
work on recruitment what we've done is
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
is in the future budgets it's not that
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've grown our budget in any sort of
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
way we just changed the way we do
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
business so this helps stand up that
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
model um in terms of how we do business
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay yeah I think it's fair
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
we have to absorb it yeah so the other
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
thing you wanted to know is what new
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
programs have been established in the
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
last six
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
years not very many but there's
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
one hi again um so in 2021 uh House Bill
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
2 established paid family medical leave
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it was a a first and en
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
model for a voluntary pfml program and
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
um the way the law uh set up our program
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
was it required the state to purchase
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
Paid Family Leave insurance for all
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
state employees and I'll go back and
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
talk about paid family versus paid
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
family medical leave anyway the purpose
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
was to create a market right to so to to
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
to incentivize an insurer to come in and
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
to provide the insurance for state
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
employees and then to administer the
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary aspect of the plan it's
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary because employers get to
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
decide very differently from other
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
states that have done this whether they
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to purchase Paid Family Medical
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
Leave insurance for their employees or
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they decide they want
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
to they can decide um what coverage they
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
want to um buy base coverage or there
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
are some buy up options the the basic
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
benefit is six weeks of wage replacement
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
benefits at 60% of the salary so um
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
employers can buy up to 100% or they can
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
buy more weeks up to 12 weeks um and
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
then recognizing that it's a voluntary
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
program that employers can either
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
participate in or not if my employer
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
decides I'm not I'm not buying that I
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
can as a worker in New Hampshire say I'm
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to purchase this for myself myself
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
and I can go to the individual market
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
and purchase that coverage for myself
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the law caps that at $5 a week for
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
an individual so it keeps the the um
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
cost as reasonable as possible for
 
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.229 align:start position:0%
cost as reasonable as possible for
individuals

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
um just so you know it's it's paid
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
family leave for state employees because
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
it complements already existing benefits
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have and we have a really robust
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
income protection plan if an employee
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
gets um said say catastrophically ill we
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
we provide coverage for up to six months
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
so so this is the plan it was brand new
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
here let me tell you some other things
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
about the plan um first of all Das and
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
NH Employment Security were charged with
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
implementation in New Hampshire we had a
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
four-person implementation team it was
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
me Rich labers Deputy Commissioner at
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
nhes um um and project management staff
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
in my office so four people we were one
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
time on a call with um other states that
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
were implementing um paid family medical
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
leave and we were listening to States
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk about um well we hired a hundred
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
people blah blah blah blah blah right
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
four people I want to make that point
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay so so let there there um there are
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
some usual aspects to the law and it
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
gets to the the expenses right so the
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
law authorized us to um to establish a
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
budget and to um hire consultants and it
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
also imposed on the state the obligation
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
to Market and Outreach the plan okay so
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
we um stand up the program by going out
 
01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
to bid for different kinds of contracts
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
but let me just start with the carrier
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
our carrier is Met Life a fortune 200
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
company okay with a blimp with a blimp
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
and we're paying for marketing and
 
01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
and we're paying for marketing and
Outreach

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that's one thought um we also
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
have a contract with a consultant that
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
um so what did we we had to build this
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
from the ground up and so we have a very
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
robust website if you look at nh.gov
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
there's a very prominent button it
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
brings you to our website you'll see
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's very comprehensive wonderful tools
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
for employers individuals it's uh
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's a quote calculator it's great um
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
but we have we have an obligation under
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
the law to do an annual report we we
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
have to remember remember I talked about
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
carriers and you have to manage them we
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
have to work with metti we have to like
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
work with them every single month to
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
validate the data right so there's a lot
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
of there's a lot of work that goes on
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes and and truthfully um
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
we've moved on to other important
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
priority projects and and our consultant
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
helps us survive okay um and we have a
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
very tiny contract for the website
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
itself and that's where the company
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
called silvertech from Manchester you
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
folks may have heard of it so MetLife
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
marketing consultant and and um and the
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
website uh one thing that I forgot to
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
mention on the slide I'm sorry I saw it
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
La at last night um the law
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
also established an incen for employers
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
to participate and it provides for a
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
50% bet tax credit of the cost that the
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
employer pays for the coverage so so if
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
I pay 100% as the employer then I get a
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
tax credit of 50% if I only pay 50% then
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not able to take my tax credit
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
for the portion the employees pitching
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
it okay um so when you look here at the
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
chart at the bottom of the page what you
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
see in 22 and 23 is is that's really our
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
implementation period and
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
implementation um continued even while
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
we got the program stood up and got it
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
running right and so um we we
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
implemented and you can see our
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation and our expenses and then
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
if if you look compare uh 23 to 24 you
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
can see that um we we dropped our
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
expenses and that's because because we
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
had already done a substantial amount of
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
sort of the marketing material to to St
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
to stand up the program and working with
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
our marketing vendor um we we kind of
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
right-sized what we were asking them to
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
do for us based on uh how they performed
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
and and we and we began focusing very
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
intensively in in New Hampshire so we've
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
done a ton of Outreach we've talked to
 
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
Chambers of Commerce we've talked to the
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
Bia um I like to say this they don't
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
want to talk to us anymore about this
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
right they've heard it all um but we
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%

01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
radio spots right uh we have paid search
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
we we're on social media um at the least
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
viral campaign I've ever seen by the way
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
I've always like to say um we've done
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
newspaper ads we do radio interviews Etc
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
so um I'll let you ask me questions
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin has a question uh
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
my question I remember at the time that
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
we were working on this family leave
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
that we made the provision for an
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
individual to take it yes what I don't
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
remember number is does the employer
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
have to deduct for the
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
individual so if it depends on the size
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
of the company that I work with what
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
what the employer's obligations are if
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
the in if one of their workers goes to
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the individual marketing and covers and
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
basically it's large employer small
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
employer right so if I'm a large
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
employer under the law the obligation is
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
is that if I have an employee whose
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
purchase coverage on the individual
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
Market I actually have to withhold the
 
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.990 align:start position:0%
Market I actually have to withhold the
premium

01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
premium
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
from their their pay and I have to send
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
it to to metti um a an individual with
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
who works for a large employer has job
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
protection as they do under federal law
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
um if if I'm a small employer I do not
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
have to withhold and send in for my
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
employee I might make arrangements to do
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
that it might be the employee um and
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
there is no job protection for small all
 
01:23:24.679 --> 01:23:27.709 align:start position:0%
there is no job protection for small all
employer

01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
employees how is $5 enough for this
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
benefit I mean that seems like a
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
ridiculous it it's um it's it's close
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
right so um part of the whole um think
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
about what I was talking about how we
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
stood up the program we pay for state
 
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
employees to incentivize a carrier to
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
come into the market and to create the
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
market that is that that um expenditure
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think it was $1.6 million in um in
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
$1.45 two million in 24
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay that that is helping to maintain
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%
the profitability of the program for the
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
carrier and and is a big part of their
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
willingness to stay
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
here how much per how much per state
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
employee are we paying um let well yes
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
please do um so in every agency's budget
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
as part of their salary and benefit line
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
so in the benefit line where there's um
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
as an employer we pay uh taxes it's less
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
than 1% of the person's salary and it
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
ends up being
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
0.027 it's in the middle of the slide um
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
so it's less than 1% multiplied by an
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
employees wages so that's what that and
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
that across the entire State ended up
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
being about1 and a half million dollars
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
a year that the state pays
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
um to the carrier but can you express it
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
in dollars per week or per
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
employee it's zero yes I'm going to do
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
this if it's about 1 of 1% so if you
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
make a 100 Grand which not that many
 
01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
make a 100 Grand which not that many
people

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
make 1% of a 100 Grand is a $100 or
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
$1,000 02 is
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
$200 a year so per pay period it's less
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
than $4 a week yeah yeah so okay all
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
right so first representative Lehman
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
W thanks Mr chairman I'm just curious
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
how many people have taken advantage of
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
this program and how many people are are
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
on it right now well so all state
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
employees right um we have 286 employers
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
who who have um a total of
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
11,500 employees who are eligible to co
 
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
for coverage so remember I said that
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
employers can say you have to contribute
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
so an employer may have an employee who
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
decides not to contribute therefore not
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
buy so actual individuals covered
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
through employers 600
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
6,964 this is as of September 30th we
 
01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
6,964 this is as of September 30th we
have

01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
1152 individuals who have purchased as
 
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.310 align:start position:0%
1152 individuals who have purchased as
of

01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
93024 by the way the individual Market
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
has an annual open enrollment period
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's established in the law and very
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
informally I will tell you that um it
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
just closed um January 29th and the
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
individuals participating is up to I
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
realize that someone might look at it
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
and say oh oh is that all right so I say
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
I I like to say this here's the thing
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary right and and the thing
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
about it being voluntary is it's
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary right so so it
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard the question asked but
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the answer how many people
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
in a year have taken advantage of this
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
program so so I what I did is I broke it
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
down by how many through employers and
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
how many through the individual market
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
so as of September 30th
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
6,964 are covered through
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
employers and um
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
1152 individuals and I I have some early
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
reporting that would need to be
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
validated that uh we just finished open
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment and so the number in of
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
individuals has jumped to
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
1681 but I'm wondering how many in a
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
year like is it 10% 20% oh good you mean
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
how many have accessed a benefit right
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
um I can get you that information okay
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and they don't when they go out on
 
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
this they don't get their full pay they
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
get like 60 60% yeah that's what I
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
recall so it's there is some loss of pay
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't a freebie that you just oh
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take an extra vacation no
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and by the way um for these kinds of
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
plans it's good to pay less than 100%
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
because it incentivizes people to come
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
back to work very good thank you but I
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
would expect that the individuals can
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
you can you see how much the individual
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
Market accesses it versus the others
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
because like I would assume of all state
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
employees very few the percentage of all
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
state employees who use the benefit who
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit is low but the of
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
the individual Market which are ones
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
that decide I need this I'm I assume it
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
would be much much higher yes it is and
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
and um so I have some um first of all if
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
I if if I may I can send you our annual
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
report and I have a report that we just
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
gave there's an Advisory Board um and so
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
I have all that claim data I I I'm sorry
 
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't prepare for it today it's a lot
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay um so I can show you the state
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
employee claims I can show you the
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
employee your claims right and I can
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
break out individual Market by the way
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
um a big utilizer of the plan is young
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
babies thank you all right why don't we
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
move on the last thing and I think this
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
is what you're all waiting for is
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
positions uh slides 11 and 12 and then
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
after that there's an appendix of who we
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
are and what we do everywhere but 11 and
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
12 um this is meant to show you that
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're relatively flat at the bottom
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal 19 321 we added four positions in
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
that budget two of them were at dop two
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
of them were in Enterprise
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
management for the ARP um in the next
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
budget which if you remember was the
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
budget where we we had hearings in
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
socially distant hearings at
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
do um we got one position that's the
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
business office position um to respond
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the number of attached boards that we
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
have and the work that they require um
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored I should say that amendment by
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ober um who we hope is
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
watching um in the 23 budget we got uh
 
01:30:12.669 --> 01:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
nine positions or the 23 into the
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
current budget and and here's what they
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
are so two of them were purchasing
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
agents um we're now required to take
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
almost every purchasing contract to
 
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
almost every purchasing contract to
council

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
because the council wants to see a lot
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
more than they used to and that's
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
nothing that anyone has control over
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
except five
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
councilors but it's a lot more work so
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
we got two purchasing agents uh two more
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
workers at dop and uh agencies will tell
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
you that they worry about the slowness
 
01:30:42.119 --> 01:30:43.629 align:start position:0%
you that they worry about the slowness
of

01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
um HR transactions and we're trying
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
we've gotten so much better in the last
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh since Lori rudus started actually in
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
2018 but um it's a lot of work we did
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
not have a safety officer for plan and
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
property we added one I would do that
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
again um and then we bought two new
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
buildings and each of them has a worker
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
at them I mean we have a lot of workers
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
who cover a lot of buildings but you
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't buy a building and not have a
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
person and so that's what those are um
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
and then building service worker are the
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
cleaners and we've had a lot of a lot of
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
cleaners are part-time and we had a lot
 
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
of struggle hiring when Dunkin Donuts
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
was was paying better cuz you don't have
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
to clean toilets at Dunkin' donuts and
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
um we' done some moving around to
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
part-time positions and eight
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
part-timers became two full-timers but
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a net zero but it's there
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
in our agency
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
budget um we added no positions and we
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded 28 positions I'll tell you a
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about where that is um and
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's in bold and in all capitals because
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
it's painful as all get out um because
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
everything we do affects everybody and I
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone who works for me who
 
01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone who works for me who
is

01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
underworked um so if you look at the
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
next page it'll show you kind of kind of
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
where that is uh plant and property um
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
again minimal General funds
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
um they will eliminate very few
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
positions in their budget because we'll
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
probably try to make up with contract
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
work by doing it with own with people we
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
have um so that's that risk has no
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
General funds um so and that's 18
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
positions but the 28 positions all come
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
out of the rest of operations and and
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's almost all General funds except
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
some graphic Services money um and it's
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
big and you can see in the other two
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
charts what that means um if you look at
 
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
our efficiency number in the bottom box
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
um you can see by the arrow that the 180
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
um ties to this
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
number and um how many are vacant how
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
many are filled and and you can probably
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
figure out that 28 unfunded positions
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
when you don't have 28 vacant
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
positions is something that we're still
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
working on trying to avoid
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
doing um and it's a priority because we
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of like I say I don't
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
have a unit of six that I think should
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
be four
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of units of six that I
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
think should be eight um our vacancy
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
history is in the other other chart and
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's just point in time it's gotten
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
better I I will make a point about
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
government the state hires a lot of
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
people and loses a lot of people so when
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
our numbers go up you know in a in a
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
given year we'll hire 15 16, 1800 new
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
people there's a churn and a lot of
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
people leave state government and it's
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
sort of like the jobless numbers
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
nationally when people say oh the the
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
the country added 300,000 new jobs no it
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
didn't it added 31 million new jobs and
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
it lost 30.7 million new jobs and the
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
net is that so in state government
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
there's a churn and it contributes to
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies if if you say to me
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
me well you got a vacant position you're
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
you're not using it now well no but you
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
know he left and then we hired him and
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
then she left and we hired her and then
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
and there's this churn that goes on
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
constantly I have 300 full-time
 
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
positions and I hire a 100 people a
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
year and now building cleaners there's a
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
lot more insuring because it's low wage
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
part-time um accountants there's a
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
little less churn but there's
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
churn anyway that's where we are in
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
positions I think we're relatively lean
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's my story and I'm sticking to it
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you all right final questions from
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%

should have a presentation that looks
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes great okay as you can see on page
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
two we'll be covering a broad range of
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
topics this morning page three is
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
information that probably most of you
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
are very familiar with that were
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
contributory multi-employer defined
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
benefit plan established in
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
1967 we provide a wide range of benefits
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
that are related to retirement or
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
disability for our
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
members and the pension benefits are
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
funded through employee and employer
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
contribution and investment income and
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
typically it's the investment returns
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
benefits on page four nhr r s is a
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
component unit of state government and
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
is very different from most state
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
agencies that come before you as we are
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
not at all funded by the general fund we
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
are overseen by a Board of Trustees the
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
current list of board members is on page
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
43 of your
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
presentation and we also have an
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee and
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
both the board and the independent
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
investment committee are
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and you as you all know are
 
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
our and sponsor the responsibility of
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
nhrs staff is to implement the statutes
 
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
that you pass as well as the rules and
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
the policies that are promulgated by our
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
board and in addition to um those rules
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
we also have to follow the Internal
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue code established by the IRS um
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
because we want to ensure that at all
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
times we maintain our qualified plan
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
status there are various constitutional
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
Provisions that benefit us one of them
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
is article 36a which protects our funds
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
for the exclusive purpose of providing
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
benefits which means they cannot be
 
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
diverted for any other
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
purpose and it also requires that the
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
board certify employer contribution
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
rates based on sound Actuarial practice
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and also those employers are required to
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
pay the rates that are
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
certified and these constitutional
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions help ensure that nhrs remains
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the path to 100%
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
funding page
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
five this is the basic equation that
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
makes all pension plans work that over
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
time contributions and investment income
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
have to equal the benefits and the
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
expenses that are paid by the
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
plan it relies on one of Albert
 
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
Einstein's most important conclusions
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
the compounding of interest is the
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
eighth wonder of the world and that's
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
what makes pension plans
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
work as of June 30 our assets were 12.3
 
01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.790 align:start position:0%
work as of June 30 our assets were 12.3
billion

01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
billion
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and and as of November 30th they were at
 
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.990 align:start position:0%
and and as of November 30th they were at
12.9

01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
billion the chart on the next page shows
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you that our assets are continue to be
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
on a good trajectory climbing upward
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
page seven gives you um some overview of
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
some different projects that we've been
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
working on our pension application
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
upgrade is nearly complete this is
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
something that we started in 2019 it was
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
a multi-year project and we're very glad
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
to have implemented it we have also made
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
updates to the Strategic asset
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
allocation plan we continue to recognize
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
the Cyber threats that apply to all
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
public entities especially public
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
pension plans so much confidential
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
information so we're constantly making
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we have everything up to date
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
we've also been improving our education
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and Outreach for members employers and
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
the general public we have a new
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
five-year strategic plan for the
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
investment office that was spearheaded
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
by our chief investment officer rald LEC
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we've also increased the efforts to
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
um enhance the number of members using
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
my account we are now we now have 31,000
 
01:47:23.199 --> 01:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
my account we are now we now have 31,000
200

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
members using that online portal and now
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
I will turn to Marie Mullen who will
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
give you some updates from the finance
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
side of our house good board EMB of
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh with regards to finance we
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
recently had our um pgb 3 implementation
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
as the Director had stated um during
 
01:47:47.229 --> 01:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
that time frame we identified um some
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
areas where we need to improve on the
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
employer side so um we made a structural
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
change in in our employer reporting
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
group where we assigned the employers to
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
a specific nhrs relationship manager so
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
that they had one point of contact for
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
any issues that they had with their
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
reporting payments reconciliation of
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
their accounts this has aided greatly um
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's been very well received by the
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
employers and has really been um aided
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
greatly excuse me after we've gone um
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
through the implementation to be able to
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
assist them with some of the challenges
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
that may have been out there we we
 
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
implemented some employer listening
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
sessions so we had employers come tell
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
us what they like and didn't like about
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
the new system what things we could
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
improve on what might have been missing
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh so we we have initiated new reporting
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
we have initiated some additional
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
functionality in the system to assist
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
the employers so we've made some of
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
those changes as
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
well um we also continue to en enhance
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
our uh dashboards and Reporting
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
internally so that at all times we know
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
where we are with the employers who has
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
reported who hasn't reported who is paid
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
who hasn't paid so that we can maintain
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
the collections we can identify training
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is needed maybe with these
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
employers and any issues that they need
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
having um also in finance we're also
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
working on some investment fee um
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
transparency so we're looking to um make
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
some changes within our system and our
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
processes to improve that transparency
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
break out those fees a little more um a
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
little more in detail so that we can
 
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
provide that trans Arcy so we have some
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
projects ongoing at this time during the
 
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
Spring to be able to do that and then
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're also looking to do a financial
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
software upgrade our financial software
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
um is separate from the pension Software
 
01:49:38.109 --> 01:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
System and that we've had that for seven
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
or eight years um and we're looking to
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
do an upgrade for that coming next year
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
all right I see questions from
 
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.750 align:start position:0%
all right I see questions from
representative

01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
cell thank you Mr chair um what would
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
you say is a delinquency rate among C uh
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
that you have and what percentage of
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
overall collections would that
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
constitute if if more more or less uh
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
delinquency rate I would say is is about
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh 10% right now we they are required to
 
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
pay so we do um get the collections and
 
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
we do they do pay like everyone does pay
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
so it sometimes it can be a little
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
delayed by a month or two but we do
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
follow up and make sure that they have
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
paid and we're re we're always
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
reconciling their accounts to make sure
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they they have paid so it's nothing
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
that has been outstanding for years or
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
months and months it's we're we're
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
always uh doing that collection and they
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
are required to you welcome so from your
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
is municipalities school districts etc
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
those are all Employers in the state is
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
is the state as a whole one employer or
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
is HHS an employer and Corrections an
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
employer and all that sort of thing um
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes um the
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
state is one employer except for some of
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
the component units so nhrs is a
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
separate employer P's some of the
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
component units are separate employers
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um but the state as a whole
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
employer thank you Mr chair along those
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
lines what percentage of the
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
participants are employed um like
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
nonstate entity employers like how many
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
what percentage are employed by
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and um like schools towns
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
fire departments whatever yes so
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 20% of the members are
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
state employees and the other 80% make
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
up the municipality state police fire
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
that type thing not I don't mean State
 
01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire police fire I mean
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
police and fire across the state so I
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
would assume almost 50% are school
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
districts yes or no um I don't have that
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
number of the top of my head but I can I
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
that yeah here it is well 20 is State
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's on page 18 we we don't have it um
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
Broken Out by percent but we have it as
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
um state employees are I'm sorry the
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
employee Group which includes state
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees as well as Municipal and
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
county is is almost 50% of the total
 
01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
membership and teachers are almost a
 
01:52:21.639 --> 01:52:23.390 align:start position:0%
membership and teachers are almost a
third

01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
you all right uh thank you with that
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it back over to executive
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
director thank you Marie um I'm now on
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
page nine of the presentation um we are
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
going to be getting a new building the
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
background is is that our current lease
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
we are currently we've been in leased um
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
space for um for quite a long time uh
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
currently expires in March of 2026 and
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
we needed to provide our notice of
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
renewal or non-renewal to our land lord
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
by May of this year so what we did is
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
our board chair appointed four board
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
members to act on an ad hoc real estate
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
committee and five staff members
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
including the three of us um supported
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
their work we engaged the broker kushman
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
and Wakefield to review lease and
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
purchase options in central New
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to find the most cost
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
effective Office Space over the long
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
term for nhrs staff so we can con
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
continue to provide great customer
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
service to our members retirees and
 
01:53:39.149 --> 01:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries we took a total cost of
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
occupancy approach and considered all of
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
the costs of renting and owning to make
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
an informed decision so after a
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of lease and
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
purchase options the board approved into
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
entering a contract for purchase we've
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
also conducted thorough due diligence
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
including site assessment building
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
condition and title search and no
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
material exceptions were noted on page
 
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
10 is a summary of where we currently
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
are we're in leas space and conquered at
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
54 Regional drive and our new address
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
will be 80 Commercial Street which is
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
part of the Corporate Center at
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
Horseshoe Pond so you can see there'll
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
be very easy access um for our members
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
because of the the different major roads
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
that run through there and the total
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
purchase price is $5 million we expect
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
March you're
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
welcome page 11 is significant um
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
developments since 2007 one of the most
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
important ones as you're very well aware
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
of is in 2010 was the 30-year
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
amortization of our unfunded
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
liability and since then the unfunded
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
liability has grown largely as a result
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
of changes in our assumed rate of return
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
as you can see on this page the board
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
reduced the rate of return three times
 
01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:06.589 align:start position:0%
reduced the rate of return three times
since

01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
6.75% and the reason why that's
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
important is that the assumed rate of
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
return is the discount rate that is
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
applied to our liabilities to determine
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
the pr present value of our liabilities
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
so the lower the assumed rate of return
 
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
the higher the liabilities and that also
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
means the higher the employer
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
contribution rates are
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
chaires um thank you and thank you for
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you just
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
briefly touch on the change in Actuarial
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
methodology that happened in 2007 I know
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
that was pretty significant yes I can
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
let me just get the details on that in
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
front of
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
me there were a number of changes that
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
happened around there one of the key
 
01:55:59.679 --> 01:56:03.189 align:start position:0%
happened around there one of the key
ones

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
was changing the um actual Actuarial
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
method we had originally used open group
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
aggregate to determine our liability and
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
now we've replace that with the entry
 
01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.350 align:start position:0%
now we've replace that with the entry
age

01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
normal the open Group aggregate had
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
provided um for a much lower unfunded
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
liability and artificially low employer
 
01:56:31.119 --> 01:56:37.430 align:start position:0%
liability and artificially low employer
contribution

01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
rates I don't know that they all have
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
and what is the what is the new approach
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
or we we have since 2008
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
um um we've been using the entry age
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
normal which is consider to be more
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
Community all
 
01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay page 12 um these next few pages are
 
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
a summary of different benefit changes
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
that have occurred since 2020 they've
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
been in a
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
combination of two different categories
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
the first is ad hoc inflation protection
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
for retirees and
 
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and the second category is
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
restoration of group two benefits that
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
were reduced in
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
2011 so um I won't go through the
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
details of all of these different pieces
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
of legislation so that's Pages 12 12 and
 
01:57:59.550 --> 01:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
15 and then 16 was the last one um that
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2016 and we are right now
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the process of getting ready to
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
implement the change in the multiplier
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
members page 17 nhrs membership covers a
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
broad range of public employees
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire our members are
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
divided into two groups one is group one
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
which covers employees which are state
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
employees City and Municipal
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
Employees as well as teachers as the
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
other group in group one and then group
 
01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
two is is the police and the and
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
fire we have 468 active participating
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
employers the largest single exception
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
of membership is the city of Manchester
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
employees but we do cover their teachers
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
police and fire
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
employees so the word teachers this also
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
includes other Schoolboard employees
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
right I mean school
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
nurse um and things like that yes or no
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chair um
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
typically no because the person has to
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
be a certified teacher in order to be a
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
teacher they would be just a regular
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
employee okay so they'd be a group one
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
employee they would still be group one
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
but they would not be a teacher all
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
right thank you it depends if they're
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
certified or not so a principal is
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
required to be certified so a principal
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
is a teacher would be considered a
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
teacher a superintendent might be a 12
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
month employee gotcha all right thank
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
R I'm piggybacking on a lot of your
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair so thank you for them
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
so following up to that question so
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
let's say a par educator that's in a
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
school district they would be or
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
custodian they would be um in um they
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
would be considered an
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
employee that's correct because they
 
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
certification okay so is it only state
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
certification what if there's a national
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
what if there's a position where
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
someone's nationally certified but not
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
State Certified would they be any
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
situations like that um is it just a en
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
certification um Mr chair members of
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative FR there's
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
state certification for educators and to
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
my knowledge there is not a national
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
certification for educators all right
 
02:00:34.679 --> 02:00:39.229 align:start position:0%
certification for educators all right
thank

02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.239 --> 02:00:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
okay page 18 um this shows the breakdown
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
between our active members um which
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
group they're in and which
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
classification they're in as well as uh
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
what our retirees and
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are like and we also have
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
some basic demographic information for
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
active members the average age is a
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
little bit under age 46 and a little bit
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
under 11 years of service in contrast
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
our retirees average agees is 72.2 and
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
their average benefit is a little bit
 
02:01:14.639 --> 02:01:18.629 align:start position:0%
their average benefit is a little bit
over

02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
$21,000 page 19 as you can see in fiscal
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
year 24 we cross the $1 billion
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
threshold in retirement
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
benefits with paid to retirees and
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and in addition we also
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
paid close to 40 million in the
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
post-retirement medical subsidy and this
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
$1 billion dollars is very important to
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not just to the
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
individuals who receive it but to the to
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
the communities that they live in nearly
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
80% of our retirees and beneficiaries
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
remain here in New Hampshire and these
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
payments have a significant impact on
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
the local economies throughout the
 
02:02:02.109 --> 02:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
state page 20 shows the benefits um by
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
County how much goes into each one as
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
you would expect in the more rural
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
counties there's lower amounts whereas
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
the more urban Counties have
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
significantly higher amounts of pension
 
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:18.990 align:start position:0%
significantly higher amounts of pension
benefits

02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
going page 21 shows the four types of R
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
retirement our members can have service
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
disability early invested deferred and
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
there are different benefit
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions applying to group one and
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
group two
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
members and there's also different
 
02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
benefit Provisions that are applied
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
based on the vested status and the date
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
of hire and we now have three tiers of
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
members following the 2011
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislation our pension benefits are
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
determined by a a formula that consists
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
of three components how many years of
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
service does the member have their
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
average final compensation and then our
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
benefit multiplier and all of this
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
varies with the different um member
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
tiers and
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
groups page 22 shows that we have a very
 
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
modest benefit that our members get you
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
can see how the group one retiree
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
benefits compared to those in group two
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
an important distinction between group
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
one and group two is that the group two
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
Public Safety members do not participate
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
in Social Security and so that's a
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
significant reason why their retirement
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
one page 23 shows a breakdown
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the how high the different benefits
 
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
are as you can see over 2third of our
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
retirees have a pension benefit of less
 
02:03:57.199 --> 02:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
retirees have a pension benefit of less
than

02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
$25,000 page
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
24 as wonderful as cost of living
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments colas are to retirees and
 
02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries they are very
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
prefunding employer contribution ution
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
rate and that is why the legislature
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
typically when it makes a cost of a a a
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
temporary supplemental allowance they
 
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
prefunds as well correct exactly it
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
covers all the all all of the members
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
page 25 shows what the member at
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
contributions are as you can see they
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
they are set in statute and do not
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
change in contrast the employer
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
contributions are actually determined
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
and that by our actuaries and then
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
certified by our trustees on a bial
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
basis and the timeline for this is shown
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
on page 52 of the
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
presentation since 20
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
local employers have paid 100% of the
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
employees and in fiscal year 22 the
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislature provided a one-time State
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for a portion of the local
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
employer contributions and there is
 
02:05:48.589 --> 02:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
session representative evil just follow
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
up though on on your question Mr chair
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
so even though the current state
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
contribution is zero was the point you
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
were making that when there's a cola or
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
a supplemental payment that goes to
 
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
everybody even though we pay zero for
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
the benefit is that what you were trying
 
02:06:12.549 --> 02:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
at um I I I think the point that the
 
02:06:17.229 --> 02:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
chair was making is
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
that the state when it's made
 
02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to cover
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
um temporary supplemental allowances has
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
has paid the money out of the general
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
fund rather than look to the individual
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
employers for the people who had worked
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
for them and are now getting the
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
temporary supplemental allowance I think
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
that was the point that the chair was
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
making I got yeah I can answer but
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative wer yeah the biggest
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
difference in what we contribute to to
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
retirees when we used to have to
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
contribute 35% to municipal employees
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
and County employees and so on there was
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
no way to judge what that would cost
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to look 27 months in the
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
future and say what will it cost us in
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
the budget if we just say okay we'll
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
give 35% to whatever you do and they
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
typically are putting more employees on
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
more pay raises all these things we
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't predict and when we took it
 
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
away in 2012 it was going it was moving
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
up from like going to be 120 million ion
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
over a 2-year period up from and that
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
was a big standard increase over what
 
02:07:28.549 --> 02:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
had had been the previous biennium
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
there's no way we could set a budget
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
where we contribute whatever whatever
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
you do we'll give
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
35% that that could be totally unknown
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
and even when we gave this 7 and a half%
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
it it made virtually no difference in
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's tax rate we gave 100 million
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
back in
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
2023 from Statewide education property
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
tax should have saved a couple hundred
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
dollar per taxpayer nobody even saw it
 
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
it just went away with the with the
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
school increases so there there's you
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
have to be able to predict when we say
 
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
we'll give 500 to this one 500 that one
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
we know what that is we know that that
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
that group is and we could put a number
 
02:08:14.589 --> 02:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
in there we're making a budget that
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
budget has to go for two years we can't
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
do it if we're paying whatever it is you
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
need we're going to put it in there we
 
02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the revenue yeah
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
so so the other point that I was sort of
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
making was she used the word pre prepaid
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
meaning that we ask them if we give this
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
benefit what's the cost of it to the
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
fund right now right what what's the the
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
current cost there have been cases in
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
the past where the where the legislature
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
gave a cola but didn't put any money
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
into the fund right all they did was let
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability increase and and
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
then in that case it's on all the
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
employers that Cola right because they
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
all have part of the unfunded liability
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
whereas when we prepay it's only on the
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
state coffers and not on towns and
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
schools and all that stuff no not quite
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah all right goad the cola came out of
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Surplus that was in the
 
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
fund and it and when we had Surplus in
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
the fund we could sit there and decide
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay we can give and group two would
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
have a different Surplus than employees
 
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
group group one and I remember a friend
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
of mine that was in group two you never
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
give us as much as the teachers well the
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
teachers had more Surplus because the
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
average teacher seven and seven years
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
plus just enough to get uh funded and
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
then they left whereas police would be
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
15 20 years firemen stayed on for
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
Generations so there was very little Sur
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
Surplus in the fire Surplus came in the
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
teachers union because the teacher
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
contributing the employers contributing
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
the teacher leaves they take what they
 
02:10:02.669 --> 02:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
got what they put in but the rest goes
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
into the fund that's how the fund gets a
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
surplus more in the teachers than in the
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
other ones so although people make
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
claims the numbers don't back them up
 
02:10:13.549 --> 02:10:13.559 align:start position:0%
I've been listening to these for years I
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
might argue that prior to this um
 
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
accounting change you know you may have
 
02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:21.559 align:start position:0%
thought you had a surplus but in reality
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
you didn't right so true anyways all
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
right representative rang and then we'll
 
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
get back on track okay thank you Mr
 
02:10:31.549 --> 02:10:31.559 align:start position:0%
chair so um I'm kind of curious about
 
02:10:35.069 --> 02:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
what is the benefit to
 
02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities um in joining the state
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
retirement fund I mean obviously there
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
was a benefit to the state retirement
 
02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
fund because they
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
initially contributed to the uh the
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
premiums but um I'm just wondering since
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
those have gone away what is what is the
 
02:10:54.549 --> 02:10:54.559 align:start position:0%
benefit to the retirement system of
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
having these Municipal
 
02:10:59.470 --> 02:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
Employees and
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess that that's my question well
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
I would say that the benefit to the
 
02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
municipal and County employers is that
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
the pension benefit it for most public
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
employees is a significant part of their
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
compensation and by having nhrs
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
administer it rather than each
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
individual city or town in the state of
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire having to administer their
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
own pension
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
benefit that there's a considerable
 
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
administrative savings on the part of
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
the different public Employers in the
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire okay followup Mr
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
chair and then what's the benefit to the
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system of having those
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities participate in it um
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems depend on having more
 
02:11:56.830 --> 02:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
me U on having a good pool of members so
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
that there's always members retiring new
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
members being hired so that there's a
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
steady flow of contributions in to
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
offset the steady flow of contributions
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
but um that said there's also we have a
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
substantial Corpus of in Investments
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
we've got close to you know the 11.9
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
billion at the end of November so our
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
benefits are essentially pre-funded so
 
02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
even though the money in and the money
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
out in any year could be very similar we
 
02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
still continue to grow because the
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
assets are growing so that we because we
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
because we attempt to pre fund the the
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
benefits okay thank you so would you
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
might also say that having more people
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
in the system spreads out the expenses
 
02:12:52.549 --> 02:12:52.559 align:start position:0%
over a larger group of people like like
 
02:12:54.669 --> 02:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
your $5 million building and things like
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
that yes exactly okay yes let's continue
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
page uh was it 26 I guess yes
 
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
26 so every two years consistent with
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
statute we do a an Actuarial valuation
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
which um calculates our funding status
 
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
and we also use these valuations to
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
emplo to establish our employer
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
contribution rates the contribution
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
rates has three components there's the
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
normal cost there's the payment to
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
amortise the unfunded liability and then
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's also the medical subsidy and
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
each employer employee each member group
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
has a separate contribution rate and all
 
02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
of this is all of these contribution
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
rates are based on the assumptions that
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
were dered in the most recent experience
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
study and we do experience studies every
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
four years we just completed one that
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
covered um TW fiscal years 19 through
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
2023 and we were very pleased that the
 
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
assumptions all basically held up we did
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
not have to reduce the Actuarial rate of
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
return as we had in the three previous
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
experience studies and so we did not
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
have a an increase in our unfunded
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
liability because we did not have to Inc
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
because we did not have to decrease the
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
Actuarial rate of return Mr chair yes
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
present uh thank you for taking my
 
02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
question again uh I've got I've got
 
02:14:34.589 --> 02:14:34.599 align:start position:0%
three that are hopefully quick um the
 
02:14:36.189 --> 02:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
when you were we just got had a
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
presentation from the Department of
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
administrative services and they talked
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
a lot about the retiring medical program
 
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
that they administer the medical subsidy
 
02:14:47.229 --> 02:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
is there is there a connection I mean is
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is this money that they then that
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
then Das you know is responsible for
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
administering no um um Mr chair members
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee representative Ms the
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy is only for
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
certain members who
 
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
were active members in approximately
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
2,000 so it's a it's a small group of
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
people and it's growing smaller okay
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the other two
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions when's the last time that the
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
um member contributions were
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
changed I believe that was in two
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
2011 okay so that so then that being the
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
case um any increase in
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
um the the cost is reflected in the the
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
banial Actuarial valuation that's really
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
been absorbed by the employers correct
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative months yes that is
 
02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
you and this year we are in the process
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
of conducting an Actuarial
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
audit and we this is
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
considered to be a best practice as
 
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
recommended by the government Finance
 
02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
recommended by the government Finance
Officers

02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
Officers
 
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
Association and an Actuarial audit
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
involves having another Actuarial firm
 
02:16:13.549 --> 02:16:13.559 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
recalculating and reassessing all of the
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions that our regular actuary
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
makes to ensure that our our liabilities
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
are stated correctly and all of our
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
assumptions are correct so we will be
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
hiring that firm soon and expect to have
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
August page 27 as mentioned on the prior
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
page our employer contributions are
 
02:16:48.349 --> 02:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
comprised of three components the first
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
is normal cost and that is the actual
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
cost of the pension benefits as a
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
percent of the active
 
02:16:57.599 --> 02:16:59.150 align:start position:0%
percent of the active
employees

02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
wages there's the amortization of the
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability and as you'll see on
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
the next page that is the single lares
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
component of the employer contribution
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
cost our unfunded liability was 5.6
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
24 and then the third component is the
 
02:17:24.429 --> 02:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy which I as I noted
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
earlier is a closed group and it's
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
rate page 28 the chart on this page
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
shows you what percent that each of the
 
02:17:38.429 --> 02:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
three components are in the total
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
employer contribution as you can see the
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the employer
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
contribution goes towards amortising the
 
02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.230 align:start position:0%
contribution goes towards amortising the
unfunded

02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
liability and on the bottom of the page
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
is the percent of the normal cost that
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
is paid by the different member
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
groups page 209 let me ask a question
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
here why is the teacher um unfunded
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
liability such a higher number is that
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
because more teachers collect their
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
pension and more in the other groups do
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
not do not don't get vested and that
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.309 --> 02:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I will have to um get back to get
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
page 29 um this chart compares the
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
employer rates for fiscal years 24
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
through 25 as well as the bium of fiscal
 
02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
through 25 as well as the bium of fiscal
year

02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
2627 because of strong investment
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
performance in recent years we were able
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
once again to reduce the employer
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
bium next page page 30
 
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
as discussed earlier nhrs has a board as
 
02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
well as an independent investment
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee both groups are fiduciaries
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
and are responsible for oversight of
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
different areas the Board of Trustees
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
approves the investment policy including
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
asset allocation for our Investment
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
Portfolio and hires our investment
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
consultant in contrast the independent
 
02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
consultant in contrast the independent
investment

02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee um began its work in 2009
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
after was created by the legislature
 
02:19:55.389 --> 02:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
prior to the that the Retirement Board
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
made all of the investment decisions so
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
the iic recommends investment policy to
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
the board it also oversees the
 
02:20:07.630 --> 02:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
administration of the investment program
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
and ensures that the board's policies
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
are being
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
followed the iic also hires investment
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
service providers such as our custodian
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
where our portfolio lies as well as the
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
investment manager and that every year
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
they prepare a comprehensive annual
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
investment report which gets approved by
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
the board and sent to the legislature
 
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
and now I will turn things over to Chief
 
02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
investment officer LC good morning uh on
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
slide 31 um it might be a little bit
 
02:20:43.389 --> 02:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
tough to read but the intuition behind
 
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
the slide is to demonstrate that the
 
02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
portfolio is well Diversified and we
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
have investments in equities bonds and
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
in private markets uh we regularly
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
review the investment team regularly
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
reviews uh the investment managers that
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
we invest with um the ask allocation
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
they ask the classes that we are are in
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that and we take a long-term Horizon
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
towards looking at the portfolio which
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that that we are
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing or or ensuring that we we
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
have the retirement outcomes for our
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
members uh and what you see in in the
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
pie chart on the left is Target ass
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
allocation in the actual as of 6:30 I
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
apologize for the small print as I get
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
older I find that you have to have them
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
on a full sheet of paper so uh but from
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
a cost perspective um we are being more
 
02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
a cost perspective um we are being more
very

02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
efficient on slide 32 uh details our
 
02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
investment performance let me ask here
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
what what is the difference between
 
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
Target and actual I mean you're making
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
Investments all the time couldn't you be
 
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.510 align:start position:0%
Investments all the time couldn't you be
at

02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
whatever asset allocation you want it to
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
be right not when it comes to the
 
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
private markets um that is uh it's
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
difficult because those those
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
Investments are 10 years plus potential
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
extensions and so it may take a long
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
time for us to get to that Target for
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
those Investments and the other thing uh
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh um uh chair McGuire is that those
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
Investments um we want to be able to
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
diversify how much we putting out every
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
year so we want to be disciplined about
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
that so it's not you can't get to you
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
can get to Target quickly but all often
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
times it it might cause Market impact
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
and you can't deploy the capital fast
 
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
enough and it'll be a problem so we want
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be disciplined about how we allocate
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
the the capital but private markets
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to get to um very
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you representative MTS
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm not going to even
 
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
pretend that I understand what Bitcoin
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
is but I know it's a very uh you know
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the news a lot um does the
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
fund hold any
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin no uh represent months we do not
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
hold Bitcoin um at all so it's uh have
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
my personal views on that um but it's uh
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
something that we do we don't engage in
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
Investments slide 32 uh will outline the
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
investment returns for the 135 10 and 25
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
year periods um these are net returns
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
net a fees and one thing that you'll
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
notice uh in in the in what Jen what our
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
executive director has discussed is
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
really an increased focus and on
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and um and best practices
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
and so taking a long-term approach
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
disclosing our net returns is all
 
02:23:43.269 --> 02:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
something that's very very important for
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
us and uh on the absolute basis those
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
are strong investment performance for
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
sorry just have to ask this question um
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know the um given that the 25-year
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
return is
 
02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
return is
6.3%

02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
6.3%
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that suggest that the long
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
that the discount rate should be closer
 
02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
to 6.3 as opposed to
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
6.75 um which would have an impact on
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
the liability uh uh Mi Mr chair members
 
02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee representative Mons the
 
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return is a forward
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
looking number it is not that the past
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
does inform it but the way we calculate
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return is our
 
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return is our
actuary

02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
actuary
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
plls over a dozen investment managers
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
investment consultancies to see what
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
they expect the different how the
 
02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
different asset classes will perform
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 to 20
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
years and then they do statistical
 
02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
analysis and come up with an expected
 
02:24:55.389 --> 02:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
rate of return for each asset class and
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
then they look at our actual asset
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
allocation what percent is in public um
 
02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
us equities what percent is in foreign
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
stocks what percent is in real estate
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then does a weighted average and
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's how they come up with a
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
6.75% so if we let's say they were to
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
come up with a number
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
20% um they would go well well that's
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
what we expect for the future but how
 
02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
does that comport with what's happened
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the past and then we'd say no 20%
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
really doesn't make sense we so that
 
02:25:35.269 --> 02:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's so it's it's a forward-looking not
 
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
a not a backward looking
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
number the numbers are very close so
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's not that significant right and what
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
you also have to remember about the 25e
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
return is it includes 20012
 
02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
2002 but if you were to exclude 25 years
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
6.75% did you want to add anything I no
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
I I can touch on on that in a couple
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
slides that can help outline that
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
outline us um okay on slide
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
33 um you'll see the time weighted um
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
Sor representative W thank you I have
 
02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
been monitoring this over the 30 years
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
I've been in the legislature I know I
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
can't blame a lot of this on you because
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
how long you've been here two two almost
 
02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
two and a half years three and a half
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
years but the volatility always bothered
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
me I having studied some of this years
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
ago and having my own Ira that I've been
 
02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
watching for years is it's unacceptable
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
to have this amount of volatility and my
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
experience has been been in the years
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
when it was down to around 1% when you
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
picked up the report and read it you try
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
to see what the annual return wasn't it
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
was always we assume 6.75 they wouldn't
 
02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
admit the 1% they wouldn't admit the
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
minus 4% you would really have to dig to
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
find those figures the volatility I hope
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
you can get it rid of it I mean some of
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
it may be the portfolio you chose but
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know it it's so in 25 years 6 three
 
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like that great a return
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the three years 3.4 I mean you had
 
02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:27.190 align:start position:0%
and the three years 3.4 I mean you had
the

02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
129.4 that might have been before you
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
got there I don't know but I don't know
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
what happened that time that they got
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
that bigger return maybe they sold a lot
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
of stuff but this this is not what we
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
can put a lot of faith in when we have
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
five billion in the hole and that was
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
when we started try to fix it in 2011 we
 
02:27:51.389 --> 02:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
would like billion in the whole and it's
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
just gotten worse so we've got to see
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
some better returns and we got to see
 
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.990 align:start position:0%
some better returns and we got to see
some

02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
consistency um what whatever you're
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
doing to to arrange this whoever you
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
hired to do this I would not hire this
 
02:28:06.750 --> 02:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
is or whoever's on the committee you
 
02:28:09.309 --> 02:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
need more expertise this is this is
 
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
unusual when I see endowments making 20%
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
UNC consistent basis from colleges what
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
are they doing they've got billions of
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
dollars like this but they don't have
 
02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
this this volatility and and this quite
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
frequent very low returns it's it's
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
risky and that's why we have to keep
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
making up the difference because of what
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
happened here and I remember one
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
particular person I'm glad we got rid of
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
him he was putting some undue influence
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
on on what happened with this with this
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's the cause of some
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
of this and why we've made changes and
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
the the legislature looks looks at this
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
very carefully because costs us a lot of
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
money billions of dollars in the hole
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
where can we make it up if not in
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
investment returns I'm I'm going to try
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
to answer this a little bit but
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
basically if you want a a um consistent
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
return you go to an insurance company
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
and they'll give you 4% or something
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
like that right and they'll they'll
 
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee it forever right
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
gu% years all right there you go but but
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
risk equals um equal you know more risk
 
02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
you tend to get more return right so
 
02:29:28.429 --> 02:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
when you have more risk you got more
 
02:29:28.439 --> 02:29:29.950 align:start position:0%
when you have more risk you got more
volatility

02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
volatility
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
so L
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
return not necessarily
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take a different view on this
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
and to provide a little bit more light
 
02:29:43.269 --> 02:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
on on this and what I tend to look at is
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
the is the pattern of the bars and so
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
the bars you want to see are
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
consistently above the line which means
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
posit positive returns and one of the
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
things that we're looking at is really
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
addressing the risk adjusted return and
 
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
so taking you and there's no way to
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
limate if I if we could eliminate
 
02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
volatility that would be fantastic but
 
02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
as as as chair has stated you're going
 
02:30:06.990 --> 02:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
to be looking at a very low return and
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
and that those two go hand in hand and
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
but what you see here is there's a
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
consistent return above the line and
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking for a just consistency
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
overall and to point out some of the
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
items that you already mentioned
 
02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
represented wman is is 12 2012 this was
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
a debt sealing uh debate where s por has
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
downgraded the US treasury debt and so
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
that was a significant amount of uh
 
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
volatility um in 2014 2015 those are low
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
yield environments in the market so
 
02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
there was negative rates uh in for
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
German and swiss deposits and that was
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
what was going on back then along with
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
weak commodity prices and so that gives
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
you a dynamic of what's happened and if
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're going go for that Global
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
financial crisis was very traumatic
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
covid was very traumatic and so this
 
02:30:55.870 --> 02:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
Spike that you see in 2021 was the
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
Snapback after covid and markets uh have
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh rebounded strongly with that um so we
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
didn't crystallize any losses uh we
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
maintained our investments and and
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's why you take a long-term view so
 
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
I would I would I would argue that these
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
are are very consistent strong returns
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we want to you know continue to have
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
returns above the line positive returns
 
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
over time that compound and ultimately
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
allow us to achieve our retirement
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
interesting stud that's going to be done
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
compar you with other
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
consistently all right representative
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
cell thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question so I see on your
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
target you targeted for 40% inequities
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
between non us and domestic that your
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
target was 40% so your actual is 52%
 
02:31:58.269 --> 02:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's probably what's leading to the
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
volatility because there's a lot a lot
 
02:32:02.269 --> 02:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
of stocks a lot of equities are you
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
trying to right now divest of some of
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
the equities while everything is high
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
and get closer to your
 
02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
target uh thank you for the question
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
represent camell yes that's absolutely
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do for the new as
 
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
allocation is to rebalance from equities
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
and bringing that down and and uh Del
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
and allocating that into the fiber
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
markets in particular infrastructure and
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's one of the areas that's an
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us in the portfolio that
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have as much infrastructure in
 
02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
the portfolio as you know uh um
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
inflation is higher than normal uh and
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
we believe that that should benefit the
 
02:32:44.269 --> 02:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
portfolio and over the long term because
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
those are consistent returns that are
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
debt-like but uh have a sensitivity to
 
02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:50.750 align:start position:0%
debt-like but uh have a sensitivity to
to

02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
CPI and we're talking about traditional
 
02:32:56.190 --> 02:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure core infrastructure uh
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
not opportunistic not building new
 
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
buildings and I think that's really part
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
of the risk mitigation so ultimately
 
02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
when you reduce equities down you're
 
02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
going to be reducing the risk profile
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
but you can't do that in a way that
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
compromises our ability to get the six
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
and 3/4 return which actual rate of
 
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
return to Target thank you did I see a
 
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
question over here no we're all set all
 
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
on slide
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
34 as representative wer had asked uh
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
about is performance relative to our
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
peers and so we look at this on slide 34
 
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
our consultant Kalen uh does a look back
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
relative to uh public plans that are
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
greater than 1 billion in assets uh that
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
the footnote at the bottom uh will tell
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
you that it's 138 public plant with over
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
two trillion in assets under management
 
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
and over the last 15 years um we've
 
02:33:53.269 --> 02:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
decisions that the IC has made out
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
perform 84% of our peers and so that's
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
relative to other firms that other plans
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are similar to us they may have
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
different asset allocations uh and we
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
may not know what their cost structure
 
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
is but from from an a return perspective
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
we are outperforming them and we expect
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
perpetuity representative
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
Griffin uh thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
02:34:24.269 --> 02:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can we get a list
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
peers yes we can get we actually can get
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
a list of that um it's a um it's
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
provided by Kalen our investment
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
consultant and so we would would want to
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
get what those are yeah we kind of like
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
to see an actual list if that's possible
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
welcome uh slide 35 as our executive
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
director uh and uh Chief Financial
 
02:34:56.190 --> 02:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
Officer I've already talked to you about
 
02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
some of the initiatives since I've
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
joined is really meant
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have a secure and um
 
02:35:07.269 --> 02:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
retirement outcomes that are for our
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries that that they expect and
 
02:35:13.469 --> 02:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
so we've proposed um changing our law
 
02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
our ass allocation this is that we want
 
02:35:17.269 --> 02:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
to reduce equities and allocate more to
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
private credit and infrastructure
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
believe that'll be a good long-term goal
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
for the plan that diversification should
 
02:35:26.429 --> 02:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
benefit and reduce the volatility that
 
02:35:28.349 --> 02:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh that we are exposed to by being by
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
investing in the capital markets uh
 
02:35:32.349 --> 02:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
fiveyear strategic plan for an
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
investment office that it's three
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
components to that one is is ultimately
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
we want to reduce costs and reduce costs
 
02:35:42.670 --> 02:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
um by not Outsourcing as much of the
 
02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
decision-making or the the the services
 
02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
that we we engage in so we want to
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain our investment Talent
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
today uh New Hampshire is a great place
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
to come and work nhrs is a is a great
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
organization uh we also want to invest
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
in systems and so those systems will
 
02:36:02.349 --> 02:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
allow us to be able to oversee the
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
portfolio Monitor and and recommend
 
02:36:08.269 --> 02:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
actions to the committee uh and also um
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
disclose more information to the members
 
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
and beneficiaries so that's the third
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
piece and we're going to continue to
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
adopt transparent reporting across the
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
the private markets on our website we've
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
also disclosed all the managers that
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
we've invested in in the asset classes
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
so that they're relatively accessible uh
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue to do more
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
members uh the last slide which I
 
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
discussed and before I turn over to
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
backer to our executive director is this
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
chart shows you the uh assumed rate of
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
return a national average of assume rate
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
of return uh relative to nhrs and so so
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of the forward
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
expectations that we were talking about
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
before at 20 20 20 years ago they made
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
the estimate that returns will be 8% and
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
20 when you get to today it's not that
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and so return expectations have been
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
coming down quite a bit and that's why
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
that that line has been coming down um
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and also we may also see that in some CM
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
Capital Market assumptions you're
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
expecting that to go up because you've
 
02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
gotten to a point where Market's been
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
depressed so much but in the 25e period
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
um we expect that we're going to be able
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
to achieve six and 34s and and I think
 
02:37:30.030 --> 02:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
that's really the forward estimate that
 
02:37:31.710 --> 02:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that our executive
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
director talked
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
about and so um we believe that's
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
prudent um we believe we'll be able to
 
02:37:41.230 --> 02:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
achieve that and um and more because we
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
want to continue to to to provide those
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
the strong investment returns for our
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.030 --> 02:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
with that I will yal back to executive
 
02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
director thank you Mr leac page 37 is a
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
brief recap of 2024 there were 14 bills
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
introduced that would impact nhrs three
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
of them were enacted into law one was a
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
temporary supplemental allowance for
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
certain retirees and beneficiaries
 
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
another one had to do with um um
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
group two members who had accidental
 
02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
disability who had suffered um violent
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
acts that caused their disability and
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
then also a revision for the group two
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
multiplier for certain of the tier B
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
members since 2007 there's been more
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
statute page
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
38 this slide summarizes NH rs's role
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
Visa the legisl Year we're here to
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
provide data and objective analysis we
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
provide you with fiscal note worksheets
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
Bill briefs testimonies such as today
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
and information
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
materials page 39 in summary as we've
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
gone through the presentation this
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
morning we've shown that nhrs provides a
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
modest pension amount most of the money
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
stays in state and supports local
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
economies we have a plan that's in place
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
to pay down our unfunded liability and
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
manage future volatility we've got more
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
on this in the next couple of slides the
 
02:39:28.110 --> 02:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
board has taken responsible steps to
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
ensure proper plan funding as reflected
 
02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the decisions to reduce the assumed
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
rate of return over the past 10 years
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the Improvement in nhs's funded
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
ratio relative to the nasra average
 
02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
despite the impact of the reductions in
 
02:39:48.590 --> 02:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
the annual rate of return so this slide
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
on page 40 shows how we're doing on our
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
path to 100% funding the path is rarely
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
smooth but we are definitely on the
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
right Road and we continue to make
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
progress we with our June 30 2024
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
valuation we are now at
 
02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.550 align:start position:0%
valuation we are now at
68.6%

02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
68.6%
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
funded the next slide page 41 shows how
 
02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
we expect that unfunded liability be to
 
02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
be paid down s of June June 30th it was
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
5.6 billion and you can see we are
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
definitely on the path for it to be
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
almost completely extinguished in
 
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
2039 one of the changes that the 2017
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
denial commission recommended was that
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
any additions to the unfunded
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
liability starting in
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
2017 should be amortised over 20year
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
close periods whereas the original
 
02:40:52.349 --> 02:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
you know majority part of that unfunded
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
liability is being advertised over 30
 
02:40:57.309 --> 02:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
years new additions to the unfunded
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
liability since 2017 should be
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
advertised over a shorter period 20
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
years so the green line on this reflects
 
02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
the what the unfunded liability is going
 
02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
to be at different times in the
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
future the individual bars are comprised
 
02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the initial pre-june 30 2017 unfunded
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
liability and teal and then the other
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
gains and losses that are being
 
02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
amortised over 20 year Clos periods with
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
different colors for each of the
 
02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
two-year periods as you can see some of
 
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
these periods have gained such as 2021
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the 23 experience study which
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
reduced the overall unfunded
 
02:41:43.469 --> 02:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
liability Mr
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um given that on on
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
slide in slide 40 I mean it looks like
 
02:41:55.150 --> 02:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
um the national average for funding is
 
02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:56.510 align:start position:0%
um the national average for funding is
about

02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
76% is it is it even realistic to assume
 
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
that you can get to
 
02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
that you can get to
100%

02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
100%
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
funding um or is it advisable to be at
 
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
100% um Mr chair members of the
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee Mr Ms as a fiduciary of
 
02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system I would say that the
 
02:42:20.830 --> 02:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
most responsible thing for a retirement
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
system to be is 100% funded you'll hear
 
02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
the 80% number out there a lot that all
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
you have to do is be 80% funded but
 
02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
anytime you're less than 100% funded you
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
are at Great risk of what might happen
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
marketplace and so that's why we aim for
 
02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
the 100% And I would not suggest aiming
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
for anything less because we want to
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
have $1 in the portfolio for every
 
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
dollar of benefits we're going to have
 
02:42:54.750 --> 02:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
out and I and I understand what you're
 
02:43:00.990 --> 02:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
saying um is there a cost to to to that
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
that additional 20% you know you
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned 80% is there a cost that
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
that um you know I guess Society
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
encouraged by trying to get from that
 
02:43:15.150 --> 02:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
80% to
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
100% um Mr chair members of the
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
months yes there is a cost but I would
 
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
argue that there's a greater cost by not
 
02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
getting to the 100% because you're at
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
greater risk so that if there's a 2001
 
02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
Tech bubble or there's another pandemic
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
you are at Great risk of having the
 
02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio be further devalued and then
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
needing to have even higher employer
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
contributions because once we get to the
 
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
100% funding rate
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
then we the employer contribution rates
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
will be able to go down dramatically as
 
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
you saw on the slide in the
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
20s the unfunded
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
liability um is
 
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
responsible paying down that unfunded
 
02:44:10.750 --> 02:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
liability is responsible for the
 
02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority page 28 the
 
02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the employer
 
02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.790 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the employer
contributions

02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
02:44:22.349 --> 02:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
rates and so if there's no unfunded
 
02:44:25.230 --> 02:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
liability the employer contribution rate
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
will be able to go down dramatically
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
because at that point um there's just
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
the the normal cost of the benefit as
 
02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
well as the medical subsidy there are
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
different triggers that are already in
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute as to how
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
the balance of the normal cost will be
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
the contributions for that will will
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
change once we get to 100% funding but
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
the employers will see a
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
significant overall decrease in what
 
02:44:58.510 --> 02:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're paying so I'm going to answer it
 
02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
this way for the next 15 or 16 years
 
02:45:07.389 --> 02:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
every um government employee in the
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
state state Municipal Etc is costing us
 
02:45:15.389 --> 02:45:15.399 align:start position:0%
10% more than they would be otherwise if
 
02:45:18.510 --> 02:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
we were fully funded right so to get us
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
from where we are now 2third funded to
 
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
fully funded we're paying 10% more for
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
every employee effectively maybe a
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
little more than close to 11% and so you
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
know it's worth getting there because
 
02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
now you could have 10% less property tax
 
02:45:40.349 --> 02:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
you could have 10% higher pay you could
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
have whatever right but it's a cost
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you
 
02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
page 42 um New Hampshire is not the only
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
state that's been working on reducing
 
02:45:57.630 --> 02:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
its unfunded liability our neighbor to
 
02:46:00.269 --> 02:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
the North and East Maine began their
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
efforts in 1997 whereas we really got
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
into it um in around 2009 and it's a
 
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
very good comparison for how our plans
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
are doing as they our plans are very
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
similar we're similar in size in terms
 
02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
of actives and retirees similar average
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
pen mention and we also both have
 
02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
similar um constitutional
 
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
Provisions so they are now at
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
and they are now at
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
86% they started at 51% back in
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
1996 and we are now at 68.6 so they're
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ahead of us and we're
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to keep making good
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
progress page
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
43 um as I've stated earlier and H has
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional and statutory Foundation
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're on the path
 
02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.389 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're on the path
to

02:46:57.389 --> 02:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability and this is a marathon
 
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a Sprint and there are no
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
shortcuts and I'm very proud of the
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
progress that has been made and I am
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
determined to stay the course and that
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
concludes our prepared remarks we'd be
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
happy to try to respond to any questions
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
you may
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
have representative rung thank you Mr
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:47:18.479 --> 02:47:19.750 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
just simple question how many employees
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
do you have and um I guess it goes to Mr
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
L's comments regarding the fiveyear
 
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan about attracting and
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
retaining investment Talent um how does
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
the profile of your employees work like
 
02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
do you have any vacancies in that area
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on your your uh
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
attraction of new candidates and
 
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
retention um yes um Mr chair members of
 
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
the committee representative rang we
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
currently have 78
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
employees and what CIO LEC was talking
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
about is that with the new investment
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
strategic plan we will be looking to
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
hire different employees for the
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
investment division
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
we right now overall as an agency have a
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
very low vacancy
 
02:48:20.910 --> 02:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
rate um our employees similar to State
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
Employees you know participate in a NH
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
HRS we have the same state health
 
02:48:27.439 --> 02:48:29.830 align:start position:0%
HRS we have the same state health
insurance

02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:48:35.469 --> 02:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
have had the same challenges that other
 
02:48:38.349 --> 02:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's employers have had in
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
attracting people because there's a very
 
02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
low unemployment rate in New Hampshire
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
but we I would say that we have been
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
able to fill all of the vacancies that
 
02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
we have we are the ones that we do have
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
we're actively recruiting for thank you
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
another question okay and then on um
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:09.389 --> 02:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
subsidy yes I can explain part of it and
 
02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
I think Marie may be able um Mar Mullen
 
02:49:15.309 --> 02:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
our CFO will maybe be able to explain
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of it so this is a we do not
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
provide provide health insurance what we
 
02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
provide is a payment to certain former
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
public employees who are eligible for
 
02:49:28.479 --> 02:49:29.630 align:start position:0%
public employees who are eligible for
this

02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:33.389 --> 02:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
subsidy and so they get that amount on a
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
monthly basis so not all public
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
employees are entitled to it it's as I
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
said earlier it's a finite group of
 
02:49:46.269 --> 02:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
people who are either receiving it now
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
or who are current active employees e
 
02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
but there are if and they all had to be
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
working in the year 2000 so it's a very
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
small group of people who are entitled
 
02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
to this amount so followup so it's a
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
it's a finite group of people who are
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
working in 2000 for the state or is it
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
just in I would assume anybody who
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
we'll have to get back to details my
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's a it's an a
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
benefit that used to exist decades ago
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
right and it ended around 2000 and so
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's grandfathered in sort of for those
 
02:50:38.269 --> 02:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
who were retired at that time right but
 
02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
for on new new people who retire they
 
02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't get this particular benefit and it
 
02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
and it's something like paying the
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
co-pay the the extra payments you have
 
02:50:49.950 --> 02:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
to pay to
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare right is what it was covered
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
what it used to cover sort of okay so I
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
think that that's my understanding but
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
it but it's
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
a from surpluses whatever but but it's
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit that that is no hasn't
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
been offered for decades right and and
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's we're paying the tail sort of
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
just like the tale of school building
 
02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
Aid and things like that so thank you
 
02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:20.510 align:start position:0%
Aid and things like that so thank you
other

02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for coming
 
02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually let me ask just one question
 
02:51:27.870 --> 02:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
based on this employee count and that
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff we don't um authorize your
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
employees right that's your board that
 
02:51:36.269 --> 02:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
that decides that sort of thing it's not
 
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
like our employees where we keep track
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
of how many and all that kind of thing
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
that that's corre corrected the the
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
board is responsible for approving a
 
02:51:48.910 --> 02:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
budget that's appropriate for the we
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
system right but the kind of things we
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
do is change the features and and
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
specifics of the plan so for example if
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
we want it to go from 6.75% to 6 and a
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
half% like Maine does we can do that by
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
law correct well right now it's the
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
board that's responsible for setting the
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
Actuarial rate of return um there are
 
02:52:15.469 --> 02:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
some states that do set the Actuarial
 
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
rate of return but that's an experiment
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
that I would argue has not worked out
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
well for the states who do that and when
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
and when the state did that for NH HRS
 
02:52:28.229 --> 02:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
it also did not work out well because it
 
02:52:30.910 --> 02:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
was set at 99.5% which even at the end
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the 90s was a bit on the high I
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
thought that number is still in an RSA
 
02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere no okay no all right well
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
there you go all right thank you very
 
02:52:41.790 --> 02:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:52:44.229 --> 02:52:44.239 align:start position:0%

all right so uh let's uh get started and
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
welcome commissioner
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
Scott good afternoon and uh I'll put in
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
the middle for now and uh yeah again for
 
04:16:33.550 --> 04:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
introductions I'm Bob Scott with the
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us here and uh for
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
those who would like we'll we'll
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully all of you uh we'll tell you a
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
little bit about our programs and and
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
and uh what we have for budget so far
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
but first I'd like to do some
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
introductions uh many of you know Susan
 
04:16:52.590 --> 04:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
Carlson uh she's our chief operating
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
officer uh longtime state employee
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
brings a lot of great great um
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
experience for the agency uh behind me
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
is Adam kpo I think he's behind me
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
yes uh he's our assistant commissioner
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
and some of you may know him from his
 
04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
past past Works uh we have in in order
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh what I'll do is I'll stay here and
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
we'll we as the discussion progresses to
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
different divisions we'll have the
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
division uh heads come up um with one
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
exception so Kathy beam is stepping in
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
in for Craig Wright uh with the air
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
division since Craig's unavailable today
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
but you'll also see Mike whimet and
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
Randy peler so who I believe is the
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
longest serving state employee in the so
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah you have a complicated um um
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
department and uh we have an hour so I'd
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
like to Let's Zoom through and and spend
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
most time on any page that has numbers
 
04:17:47.109 --> 04:17:47.119 align:start position:0%
on it certainly so I will try I'll start
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
the zoom then so uh on uh looking at
 
04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
slide number two is our or chart uh it's
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of just as I outlined it so we have
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
effectively the commissioner's office is
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
a is a division within effectively
 
04:18:03.710 --> 04:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
within the agency uh and they handle uh
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
probably the the least expected part of
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the G the state Geological
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
Survey and the state geologist so that's
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's how within the the agenc
 
04:18:15.149 --> 04:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh but we have our legal unit Human
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
Resources accounting all the the normal
 
04:18:20.910 --> 04:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
administrative functions and also uh we
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
we have a planning unit that tries to
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
guide us and move us ahead on a lot of
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
data database and uh e- permitting
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
development that that we have going on
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh the waste management division that
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
you'll hear uh from director whimet uh
 
04:18:37.710 --> 04:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
again just we manage hadous waste Solid
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
Waste landfills you may have heard of
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
this uh recently um super F funds Brown
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
Fields uh storage tanks uh contamination
 
04:18:49.149 --> 04:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
issues like pasas uh the Water Division
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
is our largest division by far uh that
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
is dams our our permitting and land
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
resource management side of of things uh
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
Watershed we we work with lakes and
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
River issues Wastewater uh issues that's
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
a a little bit of an outlier because you
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
think people think Wastewater so they
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
call Mic up uh with the waste management
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
division Wastewater is a function of the
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
Water Division uh drinking drinking
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
water is a continuous issue and we also
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
own and operate the we're the only
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
agency in the state like us that owns
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and operates a Wastewater Tuma facility
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
so we have the Waki River Basin uh that
 
04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
feeds 10 communities around that so it
 
04:19:31.389 --> 04:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
is awkward I will say that we are the
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
regulator and the regulated on that
 
04:19:36.910 --> 04:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
issue so but so be it uh the Air
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
Resource division again Kathy will talk
 
04:19:41.710 --> 04:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
and that's really uh working with
 
04:19:43.710 --> 04:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
anything that any major source of air
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
pollution in the State uh and also added
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
in that group is our health
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
environmental health unit so we look
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
that unit helps the whole whole
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
department and for instance drinking
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
water standards evaluating the science
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
and helping to create those in and
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
working with us on those standards as as
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
an example of the work they do so I
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
won't hopefully you understand our
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
mission and and and the the strong Nexis
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
between a clean environment and uh and
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
our a healthy economy uh so I I kind of
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
already listed our core functions so I
 
04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
won't uh go over that yet again we have
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of different funding sources and
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
as as the chair mentioned we have a
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
fairly complex number of programs and
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
all the things we're doing so I think
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
based on that I I just will point one
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
thing out and representative lean of
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
course is here is one issue we really
 
04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
want highlighted this year is the the
 
04:20:41.309 --> 04:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
issue of funding for state-owned dams we
 
04:20:44.189 --> 04:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
have 276 state owned dams we get a
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
capital budget appropriation every year
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
looking historically over the past
 
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
decades uh you know it's great that we
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
get capital budget money and every uh
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
year we do every bium we do get some but
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
on the current schedule we get to rehab
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
a dam uh once every 100 years and that's
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
not really sustainable for the state so
 
04:21:05.149 --> 04:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
we want to have a discussion about that
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
certainly this year and and the
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative leechman is kind enough
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
to have a a bill to start that
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
discussion so week we have a he yeah so
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
there so with that I'm going to hand
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
over to talk a little bit about our our
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
budget and uh some of the financing
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
issues with uh Sue Carlson our chief
 
04:21:22.880 --> 04:21:24.030 align:start position:0%
issues with uh Sue Carlson our chief
operating

04:21:24.030 --> 04:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
operating
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
officer good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um on the next
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
slide I gave you um four bullets that
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
just highlight the agency phase
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget that we submitted um
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
for 26 um 27 is it's also close a number
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
to that our overall efficienc budget for
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
the Department was $340
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
million um we were given a general fund
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
goal of 29.5 million for both years we
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
met those goal
 
04:21:56.670 --> 04:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
numbers um our efficiency budget for 26
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually um signals a 12% decrease from
 
04:22:03.630 --> 04:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
25 primarily in our loans and
 
04:22:03.640 --> 04:22:06.030 align:start position:0%
25 primarily in our loans and
reimbursement

04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
categories um and in 27 we decreased
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
that by additional four 4% another 14
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
million again um primarily in loans um
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
and reimbursements if you flip to the
 
04:22:22.990 --> 04:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
next Slide the next few slides are pie
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
charts and what I have done is
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
essentially broken out our sources of
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
funds and our uses are funds so in FY 26
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
um you can see our our srf program and
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
for those who are unfamiliar with this
 
04:22:40.030 --> 04:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
we have a state revolving Loan program
 
04:22:42.670 --> 04:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
for Wastewater and drinking water that
 
04:22:44.590 --> 04:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
program is a combination of what we call
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
repayment funds and federal funds that
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
is this th that srf program is our
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
single biggest program in Anar agency um
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
and it's made up primarily uh of federal
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
funds and repayment funds and it
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
accounts for 43% of our operating
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
budget the all the other federal funds
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
across all the other divisions are at
 
04:23:09.550 --> 04:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
$57 million and that's approximately
 
04:23:09.560 --> 04:23:10.590 align:start position:0%
$57 million and that's approximately
another

04:23:10.590 --> 04:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
177% of our um our operating
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
budget um our fees are I've broken out
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
program because that is our biggest
 
04:23:25.990 --> 04:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
single fee program that one is at 31.2
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
or 9% of our operating budget all other
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
of our fee programs are $77 million um
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
and that's approximately 40 different
 
04:23:37.550 --> 04:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
fee programs and they accounts for
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
23% our general funds at 29.5 only
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
represent 8% % of our operating
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
budget so as you can see we don't even
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
though it seems to be a big number it's
 
04:23:51.550 --> 04:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
a very small part of our overall
 
04:23:51.560 --> 04:23:52.510 align:start position:0%
a very small part of our overall
operating

04:23:52.510 --> 04:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
operating
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
budget as far as General Uses of our of
 
04:23:57.080 --> 04:23:58.630 align:start position:0%
budget as far as General Uses of our of
our

04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
budget 69% of our entire budget goes out
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
in the form of Grants reimbursements
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
loans and rebates um so the rest of the
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
remaining budget account is accounted
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
for in salary and benefits which is
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
23% operating expenses which is um
 
04:24:23.790 --> 04:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
current expense telecommunications
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
equipment purchases those type is 15.7
 
04:24:30.109 --> 04:24:30.119 align:start position:0%
or 5% of our budget contracts account
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
for approximately 12% loans across our
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
five loan
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
programs is 137 million or 40% of our
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget grants represents
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
another 12 % reimbursements are $18
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
million or another 5% and then inter
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
agency transfers these are the payments
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
we make to administrative services for
 
04:24:56.109 --> 04:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
building rent
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
doit um Department of Justice um that
 
04:25:03.149 --> 04:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
was makes up all of this and that's 8.3
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
or 3% of our operating
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
budget on the next slide what I did was
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
take that operating budget and break it
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
out by divisions so that you can see as
 
04:25:16.990 --> 04:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
Bob has said our water division is our
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
single biggest Division and it accounts
 
04:25:25.389 --> 04:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
for um over 50% of our entire budget um
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the budget because the state
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan program is its own
 
04:25:33.109 --> 04:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
company it is broken out in the budget
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
in two the Water Division shows up in
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
two separate areas so in order to
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
provide you some consistency with how
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
the budget is set up I broke these two
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
out on these pie charts so the Water
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
Division other than srf operates at
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
about $65 million the srf program
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
accounts for 43% of our budget air
 
04:25:59.309 --> 04:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
accounts for just 4% of robery and
 
04:26:01.630 --> 04:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
budget waste management is our second
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
largest division and at $107 million
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
accounts for 32% of our budget and then
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office comes in at
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom at 7.9 million
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
I've then taken M Carlson let me let me
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
ask a question um and this might be an
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
LBA question so I have a piece of paper
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
here that says your fiscal year 25
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized um General funds was
 
04:26:31.469 --> 04:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
18 and
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
A6 but you're saying it's more like
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
30 that is because the single biggest
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
general fund program we have which is
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state aid grant program program was
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
not included in
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
hb1 um it was funded out of hb2 and it
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
came to us as an FY 23 appropriation for
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
$ 29.7 million so it doesn't show up in
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized for 25 gotcha
 
04:27:06.109 --> 04:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
much um the final slide I have to
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
present to you is a breakdown Again by
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
division which gives you the breakdown
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
of each division how it is by funding so
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
the air division as you can see has a
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
very small oh the blue is the blue is
 
04:27:27.950 --> 04:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
General funds the green is federal funds
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
and the brown is other funds as you can
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
see the air division because it's a
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
small division at only 13 million has a
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
small piece of General funds a slightly
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
larger piece of federal funds and it's
 
04:27:45.149 --> 04:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
used and over 50% of its funding is in
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
fees the commissioner's office because
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
of the nature of it is primarily again
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
is even smaller and most of our funding
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
is General funds with a little bit of
 
04:27:57.550 --> 04:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
fee and a little bit of federal the
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
waste management division has a small um
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
component of General funds um it's
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
primarily funded with fee programs this
 
04:28:10.469 --> 04:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
is the oil fund hazardous waste fund um
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
oil Pollution Control fund they are
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
primarily fee count the Water Division
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
other than srf has the
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
most equalized funding it is a fairly
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
large General funds um offset by a
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
little larger federal funds and even a
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
little more fee account now the SAG
 
04:28:33.950 --> 04:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
grant for the most part is what sits in
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
the air excuse me sits in the Water
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
Division that's where our biggest um
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
general fund program is the um water srf
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
has no General
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
funds and it is primarily Federal and
 
04:28:49.239 --> 04:28:50.910 align:start position:0%
funds and it is primarily Federal and
repayment

04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
04:28:50.920 --> 04:28:53.309 align:start position:0%
repayment
funds

04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Mr chair I'm I'm one
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
of the newbies on this committee so bear
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
with me
 
04:29:03.030 --> 04:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
um can you explain this srf a little bit
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
better a not better but you know a
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
little more detail I'm struggling with
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
what it is and how it works and the
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
state revolving Loan program is actually
 
04:29:15.309 --> 04:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
two programs it is Wastewater and
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
drinking water the Wastewater srf
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
Federal program was started by EPA back
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the mid
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
80s and essentially the federal
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
government gives us a grant that we
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
match with 20% State funds to make
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
loans to uh low market rate loans to
 
04:29:39.750 --> 04:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to um reconstruct or
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.990 --> 04:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
clarify so this is a congressional
 
04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's administered through
 
04:29:53.550 --> 04:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
EPA yeah um when the loan is repaid that
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
goes into a repayment fund and from that
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
repayment fund we then in turn make more
 
04:29:58.520 --> 04:30:00.349 align:start position:0%
repayment fund we then in turn make more
additional

04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
loans the drink you want yes I yeah
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative evil go ahead so when you
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
said in the beginning that you're
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
reducing your budget through loans and
 
04:30:11.159 --> 04:30:12.469 align:start position:0%
reducing your budget through loans and
reimbursements

04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursements
 
04:30:14.429 --> 04:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to get to this but is
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
it through the srf or what's the um in a
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
combination of srf and
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
past um I didn't want to get into this
 
04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
today I had a feeling I was jumping the
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
gun maybe I have when we come back to
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
you I will have this in much more detail
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
for you um but the drinking water srf
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
program again is you know it comes from
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
EPA it's an 8020 program um and it was
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
started in the
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
mid90s and it is for loans and grants um
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
to um water drinking water systems um
 
04:31:01.229 --> 04:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
both public and and small private um so
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
what happens is these programs have been
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
going on for quite a while um and we
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
have um staff that um support this
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
program and not only do they support the
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
Loan program but they support all their
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
um Federal requirements um to ensure
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with um for the rebuilding of
 
04:31:21.000 --> 04:31:21.710 align:start position:0%
compliance with um for the rebuilding of
these

04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
programs so if I could could add so the
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
numbers you see for the state revolving
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
are are augmented by the infrastructure
 
04:31:36.990 --> 04:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
Bill the the ija the bill money uh so
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
there there for the next couple years
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then it'll go back to more normal uh
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
they've been augmented by that but
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
bottom line is these are passrs to to
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
community water systems or Wastewater
 
04:31:52.189 --> 04:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
systems did did I hear correctly that
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
that buried in the waste um numbers is
 
04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
also and and a a revolving
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
fund the waste management division has
 
04:32:06.189 --> 04:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
one small loan program which is the
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
brownfields Loan
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
program that is at less than a million
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
and it's oh and then the past LF which I
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
um and the drinking water let me back up
 
04:32:20.319 --> 04:32:21.630 align:start position:0%
um and the drinking water let me back up
that's

04:32:21.630 --> 04:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
fun let me back up there are five loan
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
programs there is the Clean Water srf
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the drinking water srf then in the waste
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
management division we have the drinking
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund which also
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
operates loans we have the past response
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
fund which also does loans and then we
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
have the brown Fields Program which I
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
often forget about because it's less
 
04:32:47.469 --> 04:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars a
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
year they operate the same way as the as
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
you describe s yes they are not they
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't have quite the same Federal const
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions on
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
them that the srf does so you said that
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have to put in 20% matching funds but
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's no blue line on on this thing so
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
somehow the other stuff counts is that
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
it no no the state matches the srf
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
budget thank
 
04:33:22.510 --> 04:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
you so before you bring the next group
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
up uh I I know the committee had
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions that that were sent to us
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
those are at the those are answered in
 
04:33:31.869 --> 04:33:31.879 align:start position:0%
slides at the End by the way for those
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
guess representative evil so is Sag is
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
that what we call buo
 
04:33:42.480 --> 04:33:44.750 align:start position:0%
that what we call buo
box

04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
box
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
yes Sor um and and actually the SAG
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
program is made up of three components
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
there is the Wastewater system component
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
which is the largest most active
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
component there is landfill closures
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
which uh we are not we have not offered
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
any new grants and years and will be
 
04:34:04.830 --> 04:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
ending in
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
2033 and then there's the public water
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
interconnection sag program which is
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
also what we consider to be a closed
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
program program there's no new grants
 
04:34:16.830 --> 04:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
being offered under those that funding
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
will end in
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
2052 okay and these are for the
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee's edification the SAG program
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
is an after Thea grant program where um
 
04:34:35.310 --> 04:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
we pay essentially 20% of The Debt
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
Service payments on any bonded debt they
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
have that qualifies under these programs
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
um under these programs of course is
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
subject to funding and that's a state
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
only program there's no federal
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
right and then I suppose you are holding
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
your breath to see what happens with the
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
federal fund halt been well it's been
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
it oh okay all right I did not know that
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
well you heard it here first
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
but but it's likely to there will be
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
some cutbacks I I would guess but anyway
 
04:35:16.840 --> 04:35:17.830 align:start position:0%
some cutbacks I I would guess but anyway
we'll

04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
see yes representative Le uh thank you
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so Susan you kind of went
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
very quickly over the 12% decrease uh 47
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
million for the loans and
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursements what are you looking to
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
reduce is that going into those delayed
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
and deferreds or no essentially we we
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
received a great deal of bill money in
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
24 and
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
25 um and so we had up those budgets
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
considerably um because we received so
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
much funding um and what we did was we
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
took a hard look at what those amounts
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
were and we right sized the budget
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
downward for 26 and 27 for those so
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman so you're not
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
cutting back any of the existing
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
commitments that this Dees has made to
 
04:36:17.470 --> 04:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
communities at all if we've made the
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
commitment we that commitment okay thank
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
you thanks Mr
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman oh sorry thank you Mr chair and
 
04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:36:30.551 --> 04:36:30.561 align:start position:0%
question um if we look like the EPA I
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
think it's section 319 grants um there's
 
04:36:35.230 --> 04:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
a match involved I think with
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities or groups that are
 
04:36:39.789 --> 04:36:39.799 align:start position:0%
accessing those funds how do we capture
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
their match on this
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
if a third party is matching it does not
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
show in our budget what they do is they
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
provide documentation to us that they
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
have expended the matching funds and we
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
record that um in our in our grant
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
management system so that we can
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
document that for reporting to the
 
04:37:04.349 --> 04:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
you um that ended my first presentation
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
and I will be turning it over to um the
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
air Division and and Cathy to discuss
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
does good afternoon
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
chair so in keeping with the chair's
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
request to be uh brief and given that we
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
are 4% of the budget I will be very
 
04:37:35.310 --> 04:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
brief in the 4% of the time yes um I
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
just want to do a brief overview of the
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
Air Resource Division and our areas of
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility if you look at slide 12
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
we are um the director Craig Wright and
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
the assistant director Mike Fitzgerald I
 
04:37:48.750 --> 04:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
work for them in the director's office
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
where we do Regional and National um
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
work as well as Ru making budgets and
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
and the like we have three bureaus in
 
04:37:58.750 --> 04:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
the era division permitting and
 
04:38:01.629 --> 04:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
environmental health compliance Bureau
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
and Technical Services Bureau on the
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
next slide you could see that the
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
permanent and environmental health
 
04:38:07.600 --> 04:38:08.629 align:start position:0%
permanent and environmental health
bureau's

04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
bureau's
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are to issue state and
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal air permits uh so we have
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
delegation of the federal Title 5 uh
 
04:38:18.750 --> 04:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act permitting program which
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
allows us to work directly with the
 
04:38:22.109 --> 04:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sources on their compliance
 
04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
status and their permitting um as
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to having EPA uh write their
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
permits and then we also work with them
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure their compliance status with
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations and then the
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
other half of that Bureau also deals
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
with uh the environmental health program
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
which helps across air water and waste
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
division standards evalu valuating
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
Health impacts related to contaminants
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
and also helps with our air toxics
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
program required under our
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
statutes the next slide talks a little
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
bit about the permitting uh work that we
 
04:38:55.869 --> 04:38:55.879 align:start position:0%
do here in New Hampshire we have roughly
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
800 permitted sources in the state and
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
about half of them are covered under
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
what's called a general State permit
 
04:39:04.510 --> 04:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
which covers emergency generators and it
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
basically puts all the requirements of
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
how to operate larger emergency
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
generators into one permit that they're
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
they can re register for
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
um also as the granite state we have a
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
lot of Rock crushing operations so we
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
have a permit by notification program
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
for those and then as I said we
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
facilitate the federal permit program
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
the title five sources we have 28 in the
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
state so that covers landfills power
 
04:39:29.629 --> 04:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
plants um incinerators that sort of
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
situation and then the remainder are
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
construction permits and state permits
 
04:39:35.629 --> 04:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
required under our state statutes and
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
and permitting rules uh the next slide
 
04:39:41.070 --> 04:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
talks about our compliance Bureau so
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
they have a couple of different
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to ensure compliance
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
with the Clean Air Act One Is to uh
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
observe stack tests that occur at
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
facilities through throughout the state
 
04:39:54.270 --> 04:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
we roughly do between 40 and 50 emission
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
compliance tests a year uh we we go to
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
the facility and observe that they're
 
04:40:02.110 --> 04:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with procedures um the
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
sources themselves conduct the stack
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
test through their consultants and then
 
04:40:08.190 --> 04:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
we verified 24 continuous emission
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
monitors that exist in the state to make
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
sure they're operating in accordance
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
with with state and federal
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in addition on the next
 
04:40:17.230 --> 04:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
slide our compliance Bureau conducts
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
inspections of the stationary sources we
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
do about 60 to 80 inspections a year we
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
do the title five sources every two
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
years and then the remainder are the
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
state sources we also do compliance
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
assistance and we respond to
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 to 80 air permit air
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
quality complaints per year and in 2023
 
04:40:40.270 --> 04:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
we successfully settled 116 Enforcement
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
cases our elves without any federal over
 
04:40:45.788 --> 04:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
filing from EPA so that was a
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
success in addition the compliance
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
Bureau has a section that deals with
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
aestus management um we have the ability
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
to uh certify and license um people who
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
do remediation of uh asbest as well as
 
04:41:02.788 --> 04:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
notifications of demolition work that's
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
being done we also inspect schools under
 
04:41:07.948 --> 04:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
the ahara program and one would think
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
that ASB bestus would be something
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's not as prevalent as it used to be
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's actually just the opposite we've
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
actually gone up in the number of
 
04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
inspections and certifications and
 
04:41:18.510 --> 04:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
licenses over the years as more and more
 
04:41:19.868 --> 04:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
people are remodeling existing
 
04:41:21.310 --> 04:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
facilities or
 
04:41:21.320 --> 04:41:22.948 align:start position:0%
facilities or
demolishing

04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
demolishing
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
buildings and then the third Bureau that
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about is the technical
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
services Bureau uh they uh service our
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
entire air monitoring system which
 
04:41:34.350 --> 04:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
exists across the the state from the Sea
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
Coast all the way up to the White
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
Mountains and across the central part
 
04:41:40.350 --> 04:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
and and all the way over to Keen uh the
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network is used to um monitor
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
for certain pollutants that EPA has
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
requirements on they're called National
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
ambient air quality standards for things
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
like ozone particulate sulfur dioxide um
 
04:41:55.390 --> 04:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
we use this monitoring Network to show
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
our compliance status with those
 
04:41:56.878 --> 04:41:57.910 align:start position:0%
our compliance status with those
national

04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
national
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
standards and then in addition the
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
technical services Bureau on the next
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
slide um has a mobile sources unit where
 
04:42:07.868 --> 04:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
we' um administer Volkswagen and diesel
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
emission reduction act grants we offer
 
04:42:12.670 --> 04:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
or we help with the New Hampshire Clean
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
Cities program and we oversee mobile
 
04:42:17.470 --> 04:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
Source programs such as your onboard
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
diagnostics or inspection uh check
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
engine light and just to go a little bit
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
into the the Volkswagen mitigation trust
 
04:42:29.948 --> 04:42:29.958 align:start position:0%
allocations uh in October of 2017 New
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was allocated 30.9 million of
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen um settlement and
 
04:42:38.430 --> 04:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
initially it was uh administered by the
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
op the office of strategic initiatives
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
but that was replaced by the department
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
of energy and so in August of 2021 New
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees became the lead agency
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
and you can see from the pie chart
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
approximately how many dollars are
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
corporated into Municipal vehicles state
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles and competitive grants we just
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
recently went out with an RFP for
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
competitive grants and I believe the
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
state vehicle portion has been spent
 
04:43:04.750 --> 04:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
down we won't be using all of the
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
administrative uh portion we'll be
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
moving that over to competitive grants
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
to put that out to to bid and then the
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
other part of Technical Services Bureau
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
is that we work in conjunction with the
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
Department of energy here in New
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be the technical lead on
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas Initiative
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
Program as well as certifying emissions
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
and compliance with standards under the
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards and
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
working toward the heat pump accelerator
 
04:43:34.270 --> 04:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
program under the IRA program and just
 
04:43:36.270 --> 04:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
to wrap this all up with the last slide
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
just to show you where we are in terms
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
of air quality in New Hampshire um we
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
are an attainment for those national
 
04:43:44.350 --> 04:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
standards I talked about about 90% of
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
the time our air quality is considered
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
what they call good air quality under an
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
air quality index that's the green bars
 
04:43:54.190 --> 04:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
on that chart about 5% of the time so
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
95% of the time we're either in good and
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
moderate but as you can see there are
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
occasionally at each of those monitoring
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
sites uh a level of unhealthy for
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups so that's the orange
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
bar at the top um if you were to
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
remember the U wood smoke or the uh four
 
04:44:13.868 --> 04:44:13.878 align:start position:0%
fire U issues that we had the last
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
couple of Summers um we didn't actually
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
see those impacts as much in New
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the weather um but
 
04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
if if you had seen it down in like say
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
the New York area those bars would have
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
been in the red to purple uh range for
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
the air quality index so with that I
 
04:44:32.430 --> 04:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
will sum it up all right representative
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chair on the uh
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
compliance Bureau inspection slide you
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there you respond to
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 to 100 air quality
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
complaints per year how many sources
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
does that um I mean I'm sure it's not 70
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
or 80 sources um I'm just trying to see
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
if there are a few bad actors that are
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
the bulk of those complaints um thank
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
you for your question so the majority of
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
the complaints are actually from things
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
such as outdoor wood fired boilers or
 
04:45:05.310 --> 04:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
wood heating hydronic heaters I guess
 
04:45:07.708 --> 04:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
they're called um neighbor to neighbor
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
complaints on burning open burning and
 
04:45:12.190 --> 04:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing sometimes the bestus
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
issues so it's not really all about the
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
industrial sources the stationary
 
04:45:19.470 --> 04:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
sources as much as it is local uh
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
complaints okay thank you and one more
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
question sure think I'm ashamed that I I
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
think I should know this but on the
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
slide regarding the air monitoring
 
04:45:33.550 --> 04:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
what's PM subset 2.5 sure so that's
 
04:45:36.030 --> 04:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
particular matter less than 2.5 microns
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
in diameter so it's the very fine
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
particulate that can get down into your
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
lungs yeah I got it okay thank you you
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
sure so is your uh Bureau more or less
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
self-supporting with permitting fees and
 
04:45:50.350 --> 04:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
fines and things like that compared to
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
expenses or not so I believe we're 30%
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
funded by um grants and
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
and federal programs and then the
 
04:46:03.628 --> 04:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
majority of it is with fees yes okay and
 
04:46:06.510 --> 04:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it fines so any fine that
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
under their statute 125 goes to the
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
general fund I see
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
right but if you sort of put a bubble
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
around the whole
 
04:46:19.470 --> 04:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
thing there's roughly it's it's taken
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
care of itself right I mean that's
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:30.030 --> 04:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
you so now Mike whimet will come up to
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the waste management division
 
04:46:33.868 --> 04:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
how are we doing for time Mr
 
04:46:37.230 --> 04:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
chair half hour
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
left good afternoon uh Mr chairman
 
04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike whimet I serve as
 
04:46:45.070 --> 04:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire Dees and I
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
understand you want to be able to focus
 
04:46:51.390 --> 04:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
on specific questions so I will be
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
relatively brief um the waste management
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
division is really comprised of five
 
04:46:57.788 --> 04:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
bureaus and I I think the best way to
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
describe it is we have a series of
 
04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
programs within our bureaus that are
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
designed to make sure that we handle
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
waste and materials safely so they don't
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
get into the environment whether that's
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste Solid Waste or petroleum
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
products and then the other part of the
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
division is about when that when we fall
 
04:47:15.548 --> 04:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
down on that when that doesn't work out
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
so well and those things get released to
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
the environment we have programs site
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
remediation programs that are designed
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
to investigate and remediate those
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
releases so that they don't have an
 
04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on people's health so in
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
a nutshell I think that's the best way
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
to quickest way to describe us um so
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
again um as part of that uh we we have
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh there this primary responsibility
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
slide describes a bunch of things which
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go through in the other
 
04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
slides so I won won't go through it on
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
this slide as far as uh assuring proper
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
management of petroleum products um we
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
operate a very robust uh oil U
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
remediation and compliance Bureau that
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
um has design requirements and and
 
04:47:58.030 --> 04:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring for both
 
04:47:59.788 --> 04:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
underground and above ground storage
 
04:48:03.070 --> 04:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
tanks we operate um a safe tank program
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
for um home believe or not a lot of the
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
releases that occur from home heating
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
oil tanks at residences and we have a
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
safe tank program that we operate that
 
04:48:15.070 --> 04:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
provides reimbursement for um a small
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money to bring a deficient uh
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
home heating oil tank in a compliance so
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's less likely to have a release so we
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
spend a few thousand to save what on
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
average costs about $30,000 to the fund
 
04:48:30.830 --> 04:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
if we have to rely respond to a release
 
04:48:33.230 --> 04:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
um we also operate a green yards program
 
04:48:35.070 --> 04:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
um auto salvage yards in the state have
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
had for their size they've had a
 
04:48:38.670 --> 04:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on groundwater
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
quality as a result of poor oper ations
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
over the years and we worked very hard
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
for a number of years to operate a
 
04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
program that helps them understand what
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
they need to do to to to manage the
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
fluids the automotive fluids that they
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
that they encounter and to try to
 
04:48:56.910 --> 04:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
minimize those impacts and then um we
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
also uh uh operate a uh uh work on
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
removing non-compliant tanks we have a
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
number of programs to try to get those
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
non-compliant tanks out of the
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
ground uh with regard to assuring proper
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
management of solid and hazardous waste
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
our our solid waste and hazardous waste
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
bureaus operate both compliance
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
assurance and monitoring and inspection
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
programs for facilities in both of those
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
categories uh we also operate permitting
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
programs particularly in the solid waste
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
program every solid waste facility is
 
04:49:30.430 --> 04:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
required to have a permit we administer
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
our regulation of those facilities
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
through a permit system we spend a lot
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
of time providing technical assistance
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have very robust training programs in
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
both of those areas is where um if
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
you're a solid waste operator even at
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
just a transfer station you're required
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
to get certified as a solid waste
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
operator and we operate a very popular
 
04:49:53.230 --> 04:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
training program to make sure that even
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
just the guy right in the front line
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with your trash when you bring
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
it to him on the trans at the transfer
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
station on Saturday that he understands
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
um what the issues are there what needs
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
to be done to make sure that those
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
wastes are managed safely and on our
 
04:50:09.070 --> 04:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hazard way side um a little more complex
 
04:50:11.948 --> 04:50:11.958 align:start position:0%
we do uh for large larer generators of
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
of hazardous waste are required to have
 
04:50:16.510 --> 04:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
a hazardous waste coordinator that's
 
04:50:18.750 --> 04:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
certified by the department and they go
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
through a training program on an annual
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
basis to make sure and maintain that
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
training to make sure that they can
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
safely manage hazardous wastes um we
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
also do complaint investigations in both
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
of those categories and as Susan
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier we do operate a
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
landfill closure grant program which was
 
04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
very active a few decades ago when a lot
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
of Municipal unlined Solid Waste
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
landfills were being en closed but many
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
of those have done their work and the
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
their their their bond payments are are
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
are winding down so that program from a
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
budgetary standpoint is getting smaller
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
and smaller each year um we do operate
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
um a very important emergency spill
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
response program we have one at least
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
one person on call uh 24 hours a day 7
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
days a week 365 days a year to assist
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
our um local First Responders Whenever
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
there is a release of hazardous waste or
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials or oil so um you
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
know this time of year we got a lot of
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
oil peder trucks going over the road and
 
04:51:18.910 --> 04:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
we have weather events like I think
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have today where some of
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
them will go off the road and create a
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
problem or if there's a tractor trailer
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
that gets into an accident on the
 
04:51:28.030 --> 04:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
interstate and the saddle tanks of
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
diesel fuel get ruptured and spill um of
 
04:51:32.670 --> 04:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
course our fire departments are our
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
First Responders for that but they rely
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
heavily on our staff to come out to the
 
04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
scene help uh address the is impacts of
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
any releases and if necessary call in
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
our contractors to provide um
 
04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
remediation and clean up of those of
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
those events um we also have a lot of
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
Partners in that we coordinate with the
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
homeland security and Emergency
 
04:51:54.910 --> 04:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
Management State Police and again those
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
local fire departments um we also do a
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
lot of response planning for both Inland
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
and Coastal respons uh potential spills
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
we have um a lot of oil storage uh
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
capacity on the SE Coast that
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
potentially threatens scaa River and
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
Great Bay so we spend some resources to
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we have a response plan for
 
04:52:19.830 --> 04:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we manage uh we have a whole
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
booming strategy to protect Great Bay
 
04:52:23.070 --> 04:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
and we have booming strategies to
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
protect other other waterways on the Sea
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
Coast and Inland and we we we spent a
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
lot of time being prepared for that we
 
04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
work with our partners who include you
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
know our main D because we share the
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
water with them uh the Coast Guard EPA
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
the Naval Shipyard um and all of our
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
other local state um part Partners in
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
that then uh with respect to
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
contaminated site investigation
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
remediation we do oversee the
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
investigation and Remediation of any
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
sites where petroleum has been released
 
04:52:55.788 --> 04:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
haard waste and we also have a a federal
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
program where we uh administer and and
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
and our partners with EPA to manage 22
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
Federal super fund sites and also
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense sites here in the
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
state and I want to mention the oil
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
discharge and Disposal cleanup fund
 
04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's a very significant fund that
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
provides secondary insurance for owners
 
04:53:16.110 --> 04:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
of underground storage tanks under
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
federal law if you own and operate an
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
underground storage tank with per
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
petroleum you were required to have um a
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
minimum of a million dollars of coverage
 
04:53:26.670 --> 04:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
insurance to to address a release from
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
that tank and for a number of our small
 
04:53:31.868 --> 04:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
gas stations and operators that is a
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to do that that
 
04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
insurance in the private Market can be
 
04:53:38.190 --> 04:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to get and expensive and so
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
many years ago when we we knew we had a
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
really a fleet a crisis if you will of
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
of of of failing tanks back in the 80s
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
that were creating just a a tremendous
 
04:53:50.548 --> 04:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
amount of liability that nobody was
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
going to be prepared to deal with the
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
oil discharge disposal cleaner fund was
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
created it imposes a fee on the import
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
of any oil to the state and that goes
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
into a fund that's administered by the
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
oil discharge disposal or the oil fund
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
dispersement board which is an
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
independent board that is
 
04:54:09.310 --> 04:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to Dees they
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
meet monthly and I'm the commissioner's
 
04:54:13.470 --> 04:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
designity of that board and they
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
basically make decisions about and we
 
04:54:16.830 --> 04:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a set of rules they have a set of
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
rules that govern uh if you bring if you
 
04:54:21.788 --> 04:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
have a compliant tank you bring a tank
 
04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
into compliance and you have a release
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
you exhaust any private insurance that
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
may be applicable to it but after that
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
you're eligible for reimbursement for
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
your costs of investigation and cleanup
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
and monitoring over time um from that
 
04:54:36.990 --> 04:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
fund so that's a significant part of our
 
04:54:39.670 --> 04:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
budget it's been a very important um
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
program in this state for many many
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
years and
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
that representative wer I remember in
 
04:54:50.708 --> 04:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
the past we we built up quite a an
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
amount in the odd fund as you say all
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
oil distribution and Disposal what's it
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
sitting at these days I'm not sure what
 
04:54:59.310 --> 04:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
the exact number is for the balance but
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
there is a there's kind of a a governor
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
on that so if um the way that the law is
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
set up if the balance in the fund
 
04:55:09.628 --> 04:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
exceeds 5 million then the unobligated
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
balance exceeds 5 million then the fund
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
is required the fee is required to be uh
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
cease collecting it until the the drops
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
down so the way it's managed and with
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
the with the demands that are on it
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
generally you know we we don't that does
 
04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
not happen we stay below that 5 million
 
04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
um and actually there there will be a
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
bill we we've we hired an actuary to
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate what that looks like over 10
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
years the the fund sunsets every 10
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
years and it's sunsetting this year so
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
every you know we we we hired actuary to
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
really evaluate where we've been at
 
04:55:45.070 --> 04:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
where we what we look what it looks like
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to get using projections
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
about future Imports of oil and revenues
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
and such and they made recommendations
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the board about how those fees should
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
be adjusted and there's a bill to make
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
those adjustments this because 5 million
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a lot if if we have a
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
spill these days that is correct we I
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
will tell you that we do have we
 
04:56:07.708 --> 04:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
encumber a certain amount of money um I
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
think it's on the order of about 2
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
million now with contractors to be at
 
04:56:13.628 --> 04:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
the ready in the event of a spill on the
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast um in the first instance if
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
there were a release it would be the
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the party who caused
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
the release to bring in a contractor but
 
04:56:23.788 --> 04:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
because time is of the essence if we
 
04:56:25.868 --> 04:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
didn't get full cooperation with that we
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
stand ready with our contractors to come
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
in for the first few days of that until
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
things can get sorted thank you you're
 
04:56:35.910 --> 04:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Ms thank you Mr
 
04:56:39.150 --> 04:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for U taking my question
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm really surprised that the
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
number of uh DOD sites in the state
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and given that large number are those
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
is is has funding from the federal
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
government been made available to
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
address the on the remediation of those
 
04:56:57.990 --> 04:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
sites yes the Department of Defense
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
sites are funded um by the government so
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
we get a grant that's provided by the
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
federal government to to address those
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
sites in the whether it could be the Air
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
Force or the Navy depending on the
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
particular um site but they they take
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
the lead in doing the work we oversee
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
that and if there's work that's needed
 
04:57:17.190 --> 04:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
for oversight or costs associated with
 
04:57:20.670 --> 04:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
oversight there is a um a Federal grant
 
04:57:21.868 --> 04:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
that comes from the Department of
 
04:57:24.510 --> 04:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
Defense to to cover those
 
04:57:28.190 --> 04:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
costs so um this chart here shows that
 
04:57:31.470 --> 04:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
the you get almost 70 million a little
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
more in other funds what what is that
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
compris so I believe that's a
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
combination of so the the odd the odd
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
fund that budget is somewhere on the
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
order of about 16 million I think this
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
year um or maybe a little more more than
 
04:57:48.750 --> 04:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
that with with with operations and then
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
um the um uh drinking water and
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund represents a
 
04:57:56.548 --> 04:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
significant portion of that as well 30
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
million yeah and then
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
P right so the past uh budget is about
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
the or the uh drinking water groundwater
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
trust fund budget this year is on the
 
04:58:10.270 --> 04:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
order of about 30 million and then the p
 
04:58:12.070 --> 04:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
budg or the other funds so all in
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
combination those all come to about 70
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
million in this year's budget so is
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
those fines or no no no um so the in the
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
case of the oil fund it's that import
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
fee that I just spoke about in the case
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water and groundwater
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund that was entirely capitalized
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
through the mtbe lawsuit that um that
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
was uh that the the state took and
 
04:58:34.910 --> 04:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually from the settlement or from the
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
verdict monies that came from the
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against Exon Mobile specifically
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that was capitalized that drinking
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund was
 
04:58:46.030 --> 04:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
capitalized with about $280 million um
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
several years ago and so that the budget
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
now represents the annual budget that
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're the the amount you're taking from
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
it I got you all right thank you other
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.590 --> 04:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
I I I think we believe that sometime
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
this calendar year initial dispersements
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
from that will happen but that is under
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
the terms of the settlement agreement
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
and it's only one settlement agreement
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's still additional ones that are
 
04:59:32.350 --> 04:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
likely to come um there's a certain
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's a schedule for payout over that
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
so it's actually going to happen over
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
several years but there is expected to
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
be a substantial dispersement from from
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
year uh we we don't know the answer to
 
04:59:48.910 --> 04:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
that we we I think we budgeted around 55
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
million we think it may well be more
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
than that but we we just don't that
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't sort of sugared off yet if you
 
04:59:55.230 --> 04:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
will and we're waiting to find out what
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be and just to clarify
 
04:59:59.548 --> 04:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
so that settlement is for Public Water
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
Systems there's also legal action still
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing about private Wells so that that
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
will be years to come if whatever comes
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
of that um and the trust fund is already
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh authorized that money goes to the
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund and and they've already uh
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
committed that that at least the first
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
tranch of that will go to the
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
dees and it will be reimbursed to
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
impacted water systems that have
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
expended Monies to remediate p on a
 
05:00:32.830 --> 05:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
proportional basis so so what we're
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
trying to do is the good news is we
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
probably got with the AG's office and
 
05:00:40.270 --> 05:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
our staff we we basically I think as a
 
05:00:41.788 --> 05:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
state we're getting more of this
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
settlement money than any other
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
proportionally the bad news is for the
 
05:00:47.788 --> 05:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
most part you're talking pennies or
 
05:00:49.830 --> 05:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
dimes on a dollar compared to what the
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
cost was or impact was but again our
 
05:00:54.750 --> 05:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
commitment was for those who have
 
05:00:57.070 --> 05:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
expended money to clean this up is going
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be proportional to that their their
 
05:01:01.868 --> 05:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
fair share so to
 
05:01:06.390 --> 05:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
speak we comp I
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
understand let's continue and then uh
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
lastly I'll realizing we're running
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
short on time here I'll finish we talked
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
about the trust fund my last slide is
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
regarding past response and now there's
 
05:01:21.190 --> 05:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
we do a variety of work we dis first
 
05:01:22.910 --> 05:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
discovered our first past site was the
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
PE Air Force Base back in 2014 so we're
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years into this uh but in
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
2016 we discovered two very significant
 
05:01:33.628 --> 05:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
air deposition sites in Southern New
 
05:01:35.470 --> 05:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that it really had an outsized
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
impact on uh private and public drinking
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
water resources in southern Hampshire so
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
we are spent a lot of time and effort um
 
05:01:46.270 --> 05:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
investigating and researching that um
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
trying to provide at the end of the day
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
we really want to make sure people
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
aren't being exposed to these so a lot
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
of our work is focused on uh figuring
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
out where we we see p fast and drinking
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
water and making sure that people have
 
05:01:59.470 --> 05:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
either treatment or alternate sources of
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
Safe Drinking Water um to that end uh we
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
have a past loan and grant program that
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
has provided $71 million to public
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems and
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities we operate a rebate
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
program for individuals so that if you
 
05:02:15.548 --> 05:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
are a you know a homeowner who has a a
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
well impacted by P you can um get you
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
know a local water provider or treatment
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
provider to put a point of entry
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
treatment system on your well and you're
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to um if you're eligible to get
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
up to $5,000 reimbursement to offset the
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
costs of that treatment and also if
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
you're fortunate enough to live close to
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
a drinking water line um then you can
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
get up to $10,000 to to offset the cost
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
of connecting into that drinking water
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
public drinking water system and then we
 
05:02:50.350 --> 05:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
also have a uh uh IIs firefighting foam
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
um takeback program that we operated to
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
assist our fire departments in New
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we took back just this
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
past year we took back uh about 11,000
 
05:03:03.628 --> 05:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
gallons of these Legacy firefighting
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
Foams that contain high levels of pasas
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
and we had entered into a contract with
 
05:03:10.110 --> 05:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
a company out ofate that has treated in
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
that firefighting foam to destroy it so
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're really glad to get those Legacy
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
stocks and assists our local fire
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
service organizations with getting rid
 
05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
of that material and I'll leave it at
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that so commissioner why is p and mbte
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
and so on part of the waste management
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
Division and not the Water Division I
 
05:03:31.628 --> 05:03:31.638 align:start position:0%
guess I I two two answers one the Water
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
Division is already quite large and
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
second of all again these are
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants right so as Mike mentioned
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
they have two major goals one is to
 
05:03:42.030 --> 05:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
prevent releases and the other is to
 
05:03:43.948 --> 05:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
work once the release happens so that's
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
kind of how the waste management
 
05:03:47.230 --> 05:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
division gets in the the the first one's
 
05:03:48.590 --> 05:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
with it sort of speak as opposed to
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
Natural contaminants like correct my
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
well has arsenic right correct so then
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
you have to talk to the Water Division
 
05:03:57.070 --> 05:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
for I got you all right thank you other
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative mons yes thanks
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
um where where does the money for the uh
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
the past loan and grant program come
 
05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
from that is that was from uh general
 
05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
fund and bond um Appropriations that
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
occurred in the legislature over the
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
last several years okay nice
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
followup and then um if I heard
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the um the drinking water and
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund is used to help
 
05:04:29.230 --> 05:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
with PS um
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation um where does the where's
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
where's the line between that trust fund
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
and the P loan and grant program sure so
 
05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
it's broader than that the drinking
 
05:04:39.150 --> 05:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund was
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
established really um broadly to address
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh ensuring that we protect the quality
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
of our Drinking Water Resources in
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
groundwater and and also to assist
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
public drinking water systems with not
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
only addressing contamination where they
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
might find it and that could be pasas or
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
any other contaminant or naturally
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
current containment it could be to
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
address arsenic um um but also to assist
 
05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
them with maintaining the quality of
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure so we've had a
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
number there millions of dollars that
 
05:05:09.788 --> 05:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
have been um appropriate or awarded by
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
the drinking water and groundwater trust
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
fund advisory commission to eligible
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems to you know replace
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
aging water lines and and and improve or
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
improve the quality and the and the
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
condition of their treatment systems so
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
it covers a lot of work the the it it
 
05:05:28.990 --> 05:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
does do past for sure and I guess I
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
would say that we are um on the front
 
05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
foot on all of our programs with past
 
05:05:36.670 --> 05:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
almost all of our programs have provided
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of assistance for past we work
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
very close closely with the Water
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
Division you know they have these srf
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
programs that they've operated for years
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
so we're we're really working hard and
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm really proud that we're working
 
05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
very efficiently with the Water Division
 
05:05:52.990 --> 05:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
to as efficiently as we can administer
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
loans and grants whether it's from the
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
past response fund or from the drana
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund or from this srf
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
program or from a number of new federal
 
05:06:04.350 --> 05:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
programs like the you know emerging
 
05:06:06.548 --> 05:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
contaminants and uh disadvantaged
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
communities grant program we're working
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
really as we're looking at all those as
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
a portfolio of ways that we can help
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
local water systems and and we use them
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
we try to use them as efficiently as we
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
can to get them administered chairman if
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
I can clarify so the trust fund is a I
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
get is it 17 or 14 person member
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
commission set up by the legislature by
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
Statute I'm on it and they decide how to
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
disperse those funds the agency is the
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
is tasked to
 
05:06:38.310 --> 05:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
administer those funds meaning the trust
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
fund will vote say go do this this and
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
then we do the do the work for
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
it so that brings up something we ask
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
most people is are you assigned to any
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
commissions that aren't meeting or are
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or things like that because
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to clean up some of that
 
05:06:57.548 --> 05:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
kind of no that for me personally again
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
I'm on the drinking water groundw trust
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
front commission I'm on the site
 
05:07:02.670 --> 05:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee so if you'd like to
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
relieve me of that I would be very happy
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh but no I'm not I'm not thinking
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
nothing comes to mind that I'm set up by
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
Statute that I'm actually not probably
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
the site of valuation doesn't meet that
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
often right so uh it's spotty depends on
 
05:07:19.150 --> 05:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
what what's fire chairman wer I remember
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
60 years ago when we brought this new
 
05:07:23.070 --> 05:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam in it replaced this
 
05:07:25.150 --> 05:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
smelly stuff that it replaced what a
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing so now what are we
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
replacing this with it's a great
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
question and it has to be said that
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
those Foams served a very important
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety purpose because they do
 
05:07:37.510 --> 05:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
work really well and they undoubtedly
 
05:07:40.350 --> 05:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
save lives however um they also create a
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
lot of Legacy contamination so
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
fortunately the industry um has had a
 
05:07:46.590 --> 05:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
number of years to understanding that
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
these pose a risk and they've been
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
working to develop Florine free Foams
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
that are still very effective and those
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
are are coming on the market and you
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
know even folks like uh actually
 
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
M Boston Regional Airport is one of the
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
leaders actually getting rid of their
 
05:08:04.830 --> 05:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
legacy Foams and moving to non-f floring
 
05:08:06.990 --> 05:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
Foams thank you you're
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
think yeah I can see that so last but
 
05:08:16.680 --> 05:08:18.868 align:start position:0%
think yeah I can see that so last but
not

05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
least so we we have the least time to
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
talk about the largest
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
division perfect perfect I don't think
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
I've ever spoke for five minutes of my
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
life so for the record uh chairman Randy
 
05:08:35.350 --> 05:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
P here I'm the director of The Water
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
Division and have been in state
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
government my whole life pretty much
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
shows you how smile I am 51 years I'm on
 
05:08:48.670 --> 05:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be 53 in April 53 years in
 
05:08:48.680 --> 05:08:50.270 align:start position:0%
it'll be 53 in April 53 years in
St

05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
St
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
so if I should not off don't take it
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
personally now really I have the Water
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
Division as Bob and Susan notice is
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
certainly the largest division within
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
Dees that we have some 258 staff if you
 
05:09:07.628 --> 05:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
look at the first slide it basically
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
shows the eight programs that we operate
 
05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
and it's I would say that the water
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
division with its permitting programs we
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
issue a lot probably most of the permits
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
in state government that affect person's
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
personal lives you know and I think many
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
times they become very emotional and I
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
think we spent a lot of time and effort
 
05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
educating our staff and our our goal is
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
to treat people like we would want to be
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
treated but it uh many of the permitting
 
05:09:40.990 --> 05:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
process that we go through become very
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
emotional for a lot of people housing is
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
the largest investment of their life and
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
people get a little antsy if you will so
 
05:09:52.030 --> 05:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
on the first next slide you talk about
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the alteration of the terrain program in
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
short what that does is anytime you've
 
05:09:58.350 --> 05:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
got a large development whether it be
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
housing whether it be commercial it
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
could be a Walmart or Home Depot that
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
disturbs more than 100,000 square ft of
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
area which is roughly about 2 and 1/2
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
acres then in fact back you have to come
 
05:10:11.788 --> 05:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
in and get an alteration of terrain
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
permit and the reason for that
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
permitting why it's an important program
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
is because it deals with storm waterer
 
05:10:23.070 --> 05:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
runoff and that is we control in their
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
designs what pre and post runoff is and
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that when I started
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
years ago we all of what we dealt with
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much was Water and Wastewater now
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
the issues of the next 10 or 15 years is
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
storm water clearly storm water is a big
 
05:10:42.628 --> 05:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
deal it's a really important program and
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's only going to become more
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
important as representative rung you
 
05:10:49.990 --> 05:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
probably know this firsthand but our
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
water quality in our lakes and rivers is
 
05:10:54.430 --> 05:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
not getting better and a lot of that is
 
05:10:56.548 --> 05:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
we must do a better job of controlling
 
05:10:59.430 --> 05:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
storm water so with that being said the
 
05:11:01.868 --> 05:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
next program is a subsurface systems
 
05:11:04.990 --> 05:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
program in for what that is in layman's
 
05:11:07.830 --> 05:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
terms anybody that's building a house or
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
a facility or commercial or residential
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
they need if they need on-site septic
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
system and what happens is we have a
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
permitting program we permit somewhere
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
around 6,000 applications a year for
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater and with that we
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
licensed some 400 designers we licensed
 
05:11:34.350 --> 05:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
about the same installers so people have
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
to be certified and what has changed
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
over my lifetime is back when I was a
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
Youngster you could put in a septic
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
system a stone and pipe for3 or
 
05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
$4,000 now the average cost of a septic
 
05:11:50.350 --> 05:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
system is somewhere in the 25 to 30
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
range and the same issue has gone up in
 
05:11:56.670 --> 05:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
the escalated cost of a well the average
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
well today if it's a drill Bedrock well
 
05:12:01.990 --> 05:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
costs somewhere around $25 to
 
05:12:04.548 --> 05:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
$30,000 so when you get involved and
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing site preparation for it
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
could be a two a a lot you bought right
 
05:12:11.310 --> 05:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
out of the gate you're looking at
 
05:12:14.430 --> 05:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
$60,000 without looking that's not
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
because of us by the way that's just
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
what the market is is looking at and and
 
05:12:23.948 --> 05:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
materials for everything has gone up so
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative run uh you mentioned
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
you deal with 6,000 applications per
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
year are those all like single residence
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
applications do you do any like group
 
05:12:37.230 --> 05:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
septic systems for like housing
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
developments I would say the L shares
 
05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
single family residences but if you're
 
05:12:44.110 --> 05:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
doing let's say you're doing a
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
condominium complex you've got 30 units
 
05:12:48.910 --> 05:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
you may come in and have that divided up
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
into three different systems to service
 
05:12:54.190 --> 05:12:54.200 align:start position:0%
all 30 houses so it could be multiple
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
approaches but the Lion Share is single
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
family uh Next program that I'll go over
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
is the Shoreland program uh for those of
 
05:13:06.990 --> 05:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
you probably are aware that that 483 B
 
05:13:09.548 --> 05:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
is a statute that regulates activity on
 
05:13:13.230 --> 05:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
Shoreland property within 250 ft of a
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
lake or river and forth a of stream or
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
not that's a another very important
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
program because what that does is it
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
evaluates site development that it's
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
done properly control the amount of
 
05:13:30.548 --> 05:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
vegetation removed yet again all of the
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
requirements of that program are to
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
minimize storm
 
05:13:39.470 --> 05:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
water runoff so with that next is the
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
program and that is a program as you can
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
read is anytime you dredge a fill uh you
 
05:13:48.510 --> 05:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
put in a dock um you do a stream
 
05:13:52.270 --> 05:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
restoration as you all know the anomaly
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
in storm events we've had in the last
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
several years we've done a lot of stream
 
05:13:59.868 --> 05:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
restoration work which is very costly um
 
05:14:01.470 --> 05:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
and is is
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
the weather changes if you will we have
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
these extreme weather events Wetlands
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
program has a on call person as well
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
that would house the hscm if needed
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
along with the drinking water folks and
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
if people have a problem a road blows
 
05:14:22.350 --> 05:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
out a cover blows out we do issue
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
emergency permits and then we follow up
 
05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
after so what we try and do is make sure
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the problem is can be resolved
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
at least in the short term and then we
 
05:14:33.030 --> 05:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
follow up later and we administer for
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
that program in concert with the US Army
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
Corp of Engineers yes so next slide you
 
05:14:40.548 --> 05:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
talk about the drinking water and
 
05:14:43.708 --> 05:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
groundwater program that basically is
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
when we look at any public Wells that
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
are going to serve 15 or more people
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
that comes through that program and we
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
have uh the smaller Wells and the larger
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
WS we have very different uh rules that
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
operate how they develop those wells in
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
the the main thrs of the well system is
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if we're
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
approving a large production well let's
 
05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
say that it doesn't dewat private wells
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the area or it's it's cleaning up
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's not drawing from a water supply
 
05:15:18.110 --> 05:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
Source or something very active program
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we also regulate some 2600 Public
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
Water Systems people submit
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
electronically their water samples that
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
they have done at a private lab that all
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
comes into US electronically and then
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
that again is electronically sent to EPA
 
05:15:35.548 --> 05:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
what happens which is unique in the
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water program is we have what
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
is called Primacy so what happens is we
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
have committed to to basically
 
05:15:45.670 --> 05:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing Federal Safe Drinking Water
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
Act the state also has its own statue
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
485 which is a Safe Drinking Water Act
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
but because we have Primacy it kind of
 
05:15:56.548 --> 05:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
keeps EPA in Boston and we we oversee
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
what they would regulate it's been a
 
05:16:01.548 --> 05:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
very effective program the next slide
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
you see is the dam Bureau chair I'm I'm
 
05:16:05.708 --> 05:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
zipping along
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
here is the dam Bureau we have some some
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
276 state owned dams um and
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman is gone but he's
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
been working with us to figure out
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
funding for that program we generally
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
have capital budget money that comes in
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
as Bob mentioned earlier if we got what
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
we currently receive it would take us a
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
100 years to do all the DMS currently
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
there we've done on the back of the
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
envelope we've got what we call 64 High
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams if those would have fail it
 
05:16:39.750 --> 05:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be loss of life
 
05:16:42.190 --> 05:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh major public infrastructure loss we
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
have 64 of
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
those if we calculate and we roughly
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
calculated that if we needed to bring
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
all of those dams up to speed where they
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
should be we're talking somewhere around
 
05:16:54.320 --> 05:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
should be we're talking somewhere around
330

05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
330
 
05:16:57.868 --> 05:16:57.878 align:start position:0%
million if you look at all of the
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams which we have is
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
276 with somewhere in the price range of
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
480 500 million and that's just to deal
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
with a state-owned dam we regulate some
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
2600 public dams then privately owned
 
05:17:17.310 --> 05:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
dams within the system and a lot of the
 
05:17:20.350 --> 05:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams we have dams that were
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
fishing game dams do any of these
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
generate electricity or the yeah we have
 
05:17:25.280 --> 05:17:26.548 align:start position:0%
generate electricity or the yeah we have
I

05:17:26.548 --> 05:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
think last blush I think we have 11 that
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
generate lot they're pretty minor
 
05:17:36.548 --> 05:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
producers do you get you get some income
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
then they pay a lease I see on the dam
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
to be blunt that the amount they pay is
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
really not the issue is if we have a
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
leas c they take over the the for the D
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that's having said that that is the
 
05:17:51.628 --> 05:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
trend is that they are not they're
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
giving up their leases because they they
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
require Fork licensing for do 50-year
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
permits and most of those permits are
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
coming due and all the changes like fish
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
ladders that have come over the 50e
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
period are making it so that that it's
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
not cost effective I think uh one en
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
they gave up their Dam they they did the
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
calculation they said it would the ROI
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
would be 100 years you obviously that's
 
05:18:15.440 --> 05:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
would be 100 years you obviously that's
not

05:18:17.990 --> 05:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable do you also look at um
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
removal of dams we do and that that is a
 
05:18:27.150 --> 05:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
very active program where people get to
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
a point in time where they can no longer
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
afford to maintain it sometimes on the
 
05:18:35.708 --> 05:18:35.718 align:start position:0%
larger dams it's as cost effective to
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
remove as it is to replace so that is
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
always evaluated the all of the water
 
05:18:43.310 --> 05:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
programs get involved because of the
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
sediment downslip stream and so forth
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so on dams are very emotional you
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
know any Dam that creates an empowerment
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
that has generated Waterfront for
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
people don't want to see that damn go
 
05:19:02.910 --> 05:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
away yet they've lived on it like when
 
05:19:04.430 --> 05:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
soar is a good example you know we have
 
05:19:08.750 --> 05:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Lakeport Dam in Lakeport and there's
 
05:19:10.590 --> 05:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
probably billions of dollars on that
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
property and nobody pays a dime for that
 
05:19:15.430 --> 05:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
Dam we're looking at somewhere around1
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
to 12 million that's needed for that dam
 
05:19:22.030 --> 05:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the short term and representative
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
Lehman has has sponsored a bill and
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out Revenue so
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we can get at these large dams
 
05:19:30.990 --> 05:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
because let's face it people that have
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
had waterfront property forever don't
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
want to lose that in the towns don't
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
want to lose the tax revenue so we're
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
not the friend person in the room when
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
we talk about dam removal so how much
 
05:19:44.590 --> 05:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
lower would like one of baki be if we
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
weren't able to keep Lake Port Dam yeah
 
05:19:50.830 --> 05:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
be we guess there a somewhere around 10
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
ft and you may hear about it if it Happ
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
yeah some of the smaller dams some of
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
the lakes that we have ows on they lose
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
20 feet all right representative months
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
but we're going to have to move along
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um are re are are owners of
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
private dams required to have any
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
special Insurance to uh protect the
 
05:20:14.670 --> 05:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
against they pay they pay a registration
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
fee but we don't require they have to
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
have an emergency plan in place so if
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
something happens to that Dam they have
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
a strategy in place how they would
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
manage that but as far as the state
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
not so I've got a couple left chairman
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
but I can skip those if you prefer
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I kind of like to get to the last
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
page which with our questions if you
 
05:20:43.480 --> 05:20:44.350 align:start position:0%
page which with our questions if you
don't

05:20:44.350 --> 05:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
mind come up thank you and I'm sure
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to see you
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
again in a month or whatever
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
you so we're looking at slide 46 for
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the house finance division one
 
05:21:05.520 --> 05:21:10.470 align:start position:0%
yeah the house finance division one
question

05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.470 --> 05:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
um in the email when we were invited
 
05:21:15.548 --> 05:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
here we were given some questions one of
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
which was what new general fund programs
 
05:21:22.830 --> 05:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
have we um had in the last five years um
 
05:21:25.910 --> 05:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
we identified three programs the CYO
 
05:21:28.910 --> 05:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria program the PCB program and the
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
solid waste food diversion food waste
 
05:21:35.470 --> 05:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
diversion program um all three of these
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
receive funding in the 2425 Bal budget
 
05:21:38.718 --> 05:21:39.868 align:start position:0%
receive funding in the 2425 Bal budget
under

05:21:39.868 --> 05:21:39.878 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
hb2 um in each case it was approximately
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
a million dollars allocated to these
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
three programs under cob bacteria we
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
have um spent over half the money um all
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
of it would have been gone except we
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
received a million dollars in arpa funds
 
05:22:00.868 --> 05:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
for Soo bacteria so we moved um the
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
funding over to arpa which will allow us
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
to spend the balance of this in the
 
05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
upcoming two
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
years um the piece BCB program um came
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
through as a result of a Monsanto
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
lawsuit settlement this state received
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
um approximately $25 million all of that
 
05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
went into the general fund um and we
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
were appropriate a million dollars for
 
05:22:27.948 --> 05:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
this program um currently the way the
 
05:22:30.990 --> 05:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
statute is written we have to develop
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules before we can issue
 
05:22:35.948 --> 05:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
any grants and we're in the process of
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
developing those
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
rules um the solid waste food waste
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
diversion program um again came to us
 
05:22:43.120 --> 05:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
diversion program um again came to us
through

05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 um they also gave us a full-time
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
position we have um gotten the full-time
 
05:22:54.190 --> 05:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
position currently filled um and that
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
position and the rest of the division is
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
developing the administrative rules to
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
issue that grant program right now um
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
the expenses incurred to date um reflect
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
the expenses we've incurred for the
 
05:23:06.798 --> 05:23:09.470 align:start position:0%
the expenses we've incurred for the
position

05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:23:11.548 --> 05:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
so none of these would have new funds in
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
the coming budget or not likely ECB and
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
cob bacteria do not have new
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
funds um but the food waste diversion
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
program is part of the solid waste
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
program and that is a budgeted account
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
gotcha but we are tracking this million
 
05:23:30.750 --> 05:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and using this primarily for the
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:34.798 --> 05:23:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
thank

05:23:36.670 --> 05:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:23:39.788 --> 05:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
the we are asked the how many new
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
positions we've received over the last
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
um five years um I broke it down between
 
05:23:47.910 --> 05:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
permanent full-time and temporary
 
05:23:49.910 --> 05:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
full-time I did not include part-time
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
positions because part-time positions
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
come and go um we have received um nine
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
general fund positions um 37 federally
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
funded positions 10 other funded
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
positions um for a total of 56 as you
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
can see the majority of the federal and
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
other fun positions are full-time
 
05:24:11.910 --> 05:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
temporary these are positions we've
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
asked to be created because we
 
05:24:20.390 --> 05:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
have Bill funding our Ira funding um and
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
um to do that um we had to create the
 
05:24:25.390 --> 05:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
positions because we have fiveyear
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
funding on those and then we are asked
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
if our general fund budget is
 
05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
supplanting um Opera funds and we are
 
05:24:35.948 --> 05:24:35.958 align:start position:0%
not doing that representative Griffin
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you for taking my
 
05:24:38.080 --> 05:24:39.670 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you for taking my
question

05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
um are any of those Federal positions
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
are they they all
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
still are they all still funded by
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds or have any of them been
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
converted to State funding no those
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
Federal positions are funded by federal
 
05:24:58.510 --> 05:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
funds thank you Mr chair if I could
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate why we need those full-time
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
temporary positions so again as I
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a big influx of
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds and we had the arpa
 
05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
funds and the way we administer the
 
05:25:09.750 --> 05:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
those is we just don't write a check to
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
the community and say you said you're
 
05:25:13.628 --> 05:25:13.638 align:start position:0%
going to do this water infrastructure I
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
hope it works out we we basically do it
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
on a reimbursement basis uh and some of
 
05:25:21.628 --> 05:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
that is loans also so we need to be able
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
to and there's a lot of federal Cross
 
05:25:25.548 --> 05:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
Cutters we have to do a lot of reporting
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that type of stuff so as the program
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
is as the as the uh project at the local
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
communities is designed and as built and
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
then commissioned we have to basically
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
verify that it's meeting all the
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
requirements so we can issue that money
 
05:25:42.670 --> 05:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
to the towns to reimburse them and then
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
of course if it's a loan that could be
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
30 years 20 years that we have to
 
05:25:48.110 --> 05:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
administer the loan
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
so I say that because you know a
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
snapshot would say well what's the
 
05:25:54.190 --> 05:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
problem you got this extra money you
 
05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
gave it to the town why do you need
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
staff it's because of all those
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
conditions that we need the staff to to
 
05:26:00.990 --> 05:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
to go with that but they're temporary
 
05:26:02.470 --> 05:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
because when the money runs out the
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
position goes away right okay all right
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
well thank you oh all right one quick
 
05:26:09.310 --> 05:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
one from uh just comment Mr chair
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the Cy bacteria fund there is
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
a bill that um I'm the prime sponsor of
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
to have a new conservation license plate
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
that would the proceeds would go to fund
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
the cyano bacteria
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
fund I I made B once never to do a
 
05:26:29.868 --> 05:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
license plate bill
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
but anyways thank you very much and we
 
05:26:35.990 --> 05:26:36.000 align:start position:0%

should apologize for being unable to
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
attend last week I was testifying a few
 
05:28:09.070 --> 05:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
Doors Down I think or maybe actually
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
across the street uh so thank you for
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
your patience um so I'm the director of
 
05:28:17.910 --> 05:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire BFA and I have
 
05:28:19.948 --> 05:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
information related to the the questions
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
that were sent to me via the chair um
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
but I also understand that you would
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
just like to hear a little bit about
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
what who the BFA is what do we do and
 
05:28:32.190 --> 05:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
and how we do it so I'm I'm happy to
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
jump into that if that would be helpful
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um so one thing I always
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
like to kind of get out of the way right
 
05:28:43.390 --> 05:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
off the bat um the BFA is one of the
 
05:28:46.590 --> 05:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
self-funded independent authorities in
 
05:28:48.670 --> 05:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
the state I understand I think last week
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
you heard from uh New Hampshire Housing
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority um we're very
 
05:28:56.430 --> 05:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
different than than them in our scope
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
and our mission but uh the legal
 
05:29:01.548 --> 05:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
structure of the New Hampshire BFA and
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
the Housing Authority are are very
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
similar in that none of us are actually
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
state employees our activ ities are
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
governed by Statute but uh we use no
 
05:29:12.750 --> 05:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
State money we don't get any
 
05:29:14.788 --> 05:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the budget we're not
 
05:29:17.070 --> 05:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
part of the retirement system uh
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
crucially the conduit debt the BFA
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
issues for development projects with a
 
05:29:23.948 --> 05:29:23.958 align:start position:0%
few exceptions is not part of the debt
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
of the state so we're really separate uh
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
the board is appointed by the governor
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
and confirmed by the executive Council
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
um and then we have 10 voting members
 
05:29:36.590 --> 05:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
and there's actually four legislative
 
05:29:38.788 --> 05:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
members on our board as well two from
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
the house two from the Senate um and
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is actually unique amongst the
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
other authorities to have that tie in
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
how many full-time
 
05:29:50.548 --> 05:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
employees so we have five full-time
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
employees and then another four
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent
 
05:29:57.910 --> 05:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
contractors that's very different than
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Housing Authority 130 or something
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
they yes our models are very different
 
05:30:06.070 --> 05:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
um we we have a very different focus in
 
05:30:07.990 --> 05:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
just the way we do things I mean I'm not
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
saying it's better or worse but um very
 
05:30:15.628 --> 05:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
very different um so uh the mission of
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
the BFA really is to help growing
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
companies in the state and nonprofit
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
organizations Access Capital
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
specifically loan Capital there are all
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons why a small business or
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
a big business might have trouble
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
getting a loan from their Bank um you
 
05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
know these are good companies who check
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
99 out of 100 of the boxes that a bank
 
05:30:44.670 --> 05:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
needs them to check um but they don't
 
05:30:48.190 --> 05:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
check box number 100 and what we have
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
seen over the last 30 or 40 years since
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
the BFA has been around um the list of
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
boxes you need to check with banks and
 
05:30:58.670 --> 05:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
increasing sort of not blaming the feds
 
05:31:00.310 --> 05:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
but Federal Regulations makes it's just
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
there's more boxes to check and more
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
folks that fall through the cracks so
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
the state legislature in the early '90s
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
created the BFA with a couple different
 
05:31:12.510 --> 05:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
tools to help these good companies turn
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh ah gez we at the bank really wish we
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
could help you we actually think we
 
05:31:20.670 --> 05:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
should help you to yes we can help you
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
and we run a number of programs for
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that need as little as $5,000
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
$15,000 a few hundred, that's actually
 
05:31:31.230 --> 05:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
our busiest program to some of the
 
05:31:33.628 --> 05:31:33.638 align:start position:0%
state's key Economic Development
 
05:31:35.230 --> 05:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
projects you know we were the ones that
 
05:31:38.070 --> 05:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
did the Bae expansion in Manchester
 
05:31:39.990 --> 05:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
three of Sig Sour's most recent
 
05:31:42.310 --> 05:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
expansions the New Balance development
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
in London Derry and then with any luck
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or Friday closing on the big
 
05:31:49.150 --> 05:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
new Wayland engineering facility in
 
05:31:53.270 --> 05:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
Charlestown so and everything in between
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
so um I'll take you through a little bit
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
of the programs I won't um well I'll do
 
05:32:04.190 --> 05:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
as much as as as you want um but the
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
bfa's most active program and actually
 
05:32:10.990 --> 05:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
the least well-known program is called
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
CAP which stands for Capital Access
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
program in our statute it's actually the
 
05:32:19.150 --> 05:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
cap program so it's actually Capital
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
Access program program which I got get
 
05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
no no end of tickle out of but um this
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
is a very interesting program 90% of the
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
bfa's activities of of loans that are
 
05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
made um are through this program and I
 
05:32:35.470 --> 05:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
think you'll see is a theme here so
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
these are all bank loans these are
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
private sector loans to private entities
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
these are not bfa's money that's being
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
lent out so or the states so the the way
 
05:32:49.868 --> 05:32:49.878 align:start position:0%
cap works is every Bank in the state
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
participates and some of the credit
 
05:32:54.510 --> 05:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
unions when they have a loan they want
 
05:32:57.070 --> 05:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
to make to a borrower that's 500,000 or
 
05:32:59.948 --> 05:32:59.958 align:start position:0%
less the average is about 75,000 that's
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good um they think the loan's
 
05:33:04.590 --> 05:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
fine but they need some help they can
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
Cho they can choose to enroll it in cap
 
05:33:08.910 --> 05:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
and when they do small percentage of
 
05:33:11.868 --> 05:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
that loan paid for by the borrower goes
 
05:33:16.910 --> 05:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
into a bank account at that bank the BFA
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
matches that contribution somewhat to
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
that same account and so you get this
 
05:33:24.030 --> 05:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
little pool of money for every loan that
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
that bank makes and it's the bank's
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
account but that pool grows and grows a
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
little bit at a time for each cap loan
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
enrolls if any of that bank's cap loans
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
default and they can't fully recover
 
05:33:40.350 --> 05:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
from Liquidation of the assets of the
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
borrower um the bank can cover its
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
losses up to the degree that they've
 
05:33:47.470 --> 05:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
establish these reserves in these cap
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
accounts so it's like this Self
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
insurance program for business loans
 
05:33:55.150 --> 05:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
that the BFA helps administer and it's
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere from a low-end 50 up to
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
150 businesses and nonprofits a year
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
almost 6,000 um companies in the state
 
05:34:06.670 --> 05:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
use the cap program it's a very active
 
05:34:06.680 --> 05:34:08.350 align:start position:0%
use the cap program it's a very active
program

05:34:08.350 --> 05:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
um the cost of it uh is essentially what
 
05:34:14.670 --> 05:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
was negotiated in '92 when we were
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
formed is the BFA is allowed to use the
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
interest income on these cap accounts as
 
05:34:23.548 --> 05:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
the source of the match for contributing
 
05:34:25.590 --> 05:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
to those accounts and so it's this
 
05:34:28.990 --> 05:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
little self-perpetuating engine um and
 
05:34:30.910 --> 05:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's very neat actually if you had
 
05:34:32.670 --> 05:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
told me it worked uh before I knew about
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
it I wouldn't have believed you but it
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
does um and you can see in uh one of the
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
Pages this is just like our annual
 
05:34:41.548 --> 05:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
glossy report type thing this is just
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
these are the small businesses that got
 
05:34:47.110 --> 05:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
a cap loan last year so um it's an
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
efficient program uh it runs virtually
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
with one person it's all eign and you
 
05:34:55.868 --> 05:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
know technology enabled so it's 24 hours
 
05:34:58.030 --> 05:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
for the borrowers there's not a lot of
 
05:35:00.868 --> 05:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting it's it's very efficient
 
05:35:03.270 --> 05:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
the reason that the BFA has helped
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions billions of dollars
 
05:35:06.990 --> 05:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
of private Capital get to these
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
companies is we partner with the private
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
sector right so the banks are doing the
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
loan servicing right the banks are doing
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
the payment allocations so we can scale
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
up and scale down without having to add
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
full-time staff um you know to kind of
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
not spoil the later question the BFA has
 
05:35:27.628 --> 05:35:27.638 align:start position:0%
not added a staff person in the last
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
five years um it's been very level our
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of core operating expenses are
 
05:35:36.070 --> 05:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
between 100 1 million and 1.1 million
 
05:35:38.190 --> 05:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
for like all the things not including
 
05:35:40.270 --> 05:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
like interest in interest out you know
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
like Opex and that's been you know I
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
actually checked because I know you
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
asking since 2019 2019 it was between 1
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
million and the next year 1.1 this year
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
was 1.1 so very flat
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
um those F do those funds come from this
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
interest account you're talking about or
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
good question no Mr chairman so the
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
interest just covers like the cap
 
05:36:09.390 --> 05:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
contributions that the
 
05:36:11.708 --> 05:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
bfa's ability to pay for its own
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
operations comes from the fees and
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
interest we charge to Banks who use our
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
programs so for example one of the
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
things this is what people know us best
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
for although it's one of our least
 
05:36:27.230 --> 05:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
common things is uh the bfa's loan
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee program so this is different
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
than cap these are for loans of a
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
million to say 10 million medium-sized
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
businesses or you know depends on where
 
05:36:40.270 --> 05:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
you are know but say 20 to 100 employees
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
who are growing and the BFA on an
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
individual Case by casee basis can
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
guarantee those loans with the full
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of the state to get the
 
05:36:55.150 --> 05:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
bank from a 90% yes to 100% yes there's
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
a bunch of collateral requirements you
 
05:36:59.470 --> 05:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
know the loss rat's less than 1% States
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
never had to pay in 30 plus years on one
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
of these guarantees um but when we do a
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
a loan guarantee we charge the bank 1%
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the guaranteed balance on an annual
 
05:37:14.670 --> 05:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
basis which is actually passed to the
 
05:37:14.680 --> 05:37:15.350 align:start position:0%
basis which is actually passed to the
the

05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
borrower um so it makes the loan more
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
expensive um we actually think that's
 
05:37:23.590 --> 05:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a good thing because it's a
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
disincentive to use the program if it's
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
not needed in the eyes of the market um
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
and it incentivizes them to pay us off
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
and pay the loan off and get into a
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
lower cost debt as soon as they can um
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a one % uh fee so that's like
 
05:37:41.788 --> 05:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue we're also the state's issuer
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
for tax exempt bonds conduit bonds and
 
05:37:52.270 --> 05:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
what that that is is when the when when
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
a town or a state borrows money it's a
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
municipal Bond right it's a tax exempt
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
lower cost rate a bond there are t many
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
times where a a town let's say they want
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
to build a new wastewater treatment
 
05:38:06.670 --> 05:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
plant but they recognize that the
 
05:38:08.670 --> 05:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
private sector can do it faster and
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
cheaper and like towns aren't
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
contractors right they're not going out
 
05:38:14.110 --> 05:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
there and building it themselves so you
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
have a waste management or someone
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
whoever build your your plant wastewater
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
treatment plant so this is a public
 
05:38:20.160 --> 05:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
treatment plant so this is a public
project

05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
right public or private entities who are
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
building public infrastructure projects
 
05:38:33.070 --> 05:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
are allowed to borrow at that same lower
 
05:38:36.430 --> 05:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
interest rate for that project if a
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
state agency like us goes in verifies
 
05:38:42.468 --> 05:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
its up true public purpose project
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of tax compliance it's
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know kind of a long process uh that
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
we actually like doing it's quite
 
05:38:52.590 --> 05:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
interesting to us not to I think anybody
 
05:38:55.548 --> 05:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
else but um when we do that um that's
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
called a conduit Bond and we're
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
technically the issuer of that it's not
 
05:39:01.548 --> 05:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
an obligation of the state one of the
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
reasons we're separate from the state um
 
05:39:06.030 --> 05:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
and we charge a very small kind of
 
05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
on10th to even half that amount of a
 
05:39:11.548 --> 05:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
percent on that amount on an annual
 
05:39:14.110 --> 05:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
basis and it that covers another few
 
05:39:15.910 --> 05:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand of our fees so you add
 
05:39:19.868 --> 05:39:19.878 align:start position:0%
all those up we cover ourselves um very
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
stable um you know th those are our big
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
programs there are a few others that are
 
05:39:26.320 --> 05:39:27.190 align:start position:0%
programs there are a few others that are
quite

05:39:27.190 --> 05:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
quite
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
small um many years ago when there was
 
05:39:36.150 --> 05:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
something called Reggie um the state had
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
a few million dollars of Reggie funds to
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
create a business efficiency Energy
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
Efficiency Loan program and so we
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
administer that um that's been going
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
ever since um you know and that's that
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's the BFA in a nutshell um but I'm
 
05:39:56.190 --> 05:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
happy it's take questions so how how do
 
05:39:59.230 --> 05:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
you compare with the
 
05:40:02.150 --> 05:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
SBA that's a great question uh Mr
 
05:40:06.110 --> 05:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
chairman so I would say we are diff
 
05:40:10.910 --> 05:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
different the SBA is huge um the SBA is
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
a valuable partner to folks um they are
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know much more uh regimented right
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
they kind of have very thick policies
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
and procedures and we have some they're
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
just thinner um you know we're a little
 
05:40:27.868 --> 05:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
bit more like okay we can actually go
 
05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
visit the business and see if this is
 
05:40:31.628 --> 05:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
really a good idea or not where they're
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
more of a like do you qualify XYZ so a
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
little more nimble not trying to insult
 
05:40:39.788 --> 05:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
them or anything but a little more
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
Nimble it's a state level small group
 
05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
versus a big Federal program okay all
 
05:40:47.788 --> 05:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
right representative Campell thank you
 
05:40:49.628 --> 05:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I had some I'm looking at
 
05:40:51.350 --> 05:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
this paper I'm look had some questions
 
05:40:54.270 --> 05:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the student loan forgiven us
 
05:40:56.830 --> 05:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
program uh I'm looking at it it looks
 
05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:04.270 --> 05:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
36,7 in uh forgiveness because you only
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
did 20 students for that amount
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering um what was the
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for that how were they selected
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
was it for presumably New Hampshire
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
citizens only that had uh needed the
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and was it were the
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
institutions that were paid New
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire universities or did did you
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
indeed pay out of state uh institutions
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
with this money uh I'm just curious
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
about it because sure this is something
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
that may be brought brought up again in
 
05:41:39.070 --> 05:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
the future and I want to know how well
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
we spent our money here yeah thank you
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative so the BFA administers
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
that program um we just you know so we
 
05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't choose kind of who gets it or how
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
much that was all set by the legislature
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
when they uh approv the the legislation
 
05:41:58.468 --> 05:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
for the program and and but so here's
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
how so the max someone can get is
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
$50,000 the you have to live in New
 
05:42:07.230 --> 05:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and work in New Hampshire
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
right so you have to be New Hampshire
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have gone to a New
 
05:42:14.830 --> 05:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school um the forgiveness if
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
they stay at an employer for five years
 
05:42:19.390 --> 05:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
is actually being paid to their student
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
loan provider a bank or a whoever a Sofi
 
05:42:28.750 --> 05:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
or Fanny right right Sally May so um so
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
the the eligible industry is the
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
regenerative medicine industry this was
 
05:42:36.510 --> 05:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
sort of spearheaded by Dean Cayman and
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
the army
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester area stuff that was going on
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
and what happened was all the companies
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
that were sort of being spun out of that
 
05:42:49.310 --> 05:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
had approached the legislature and said
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know we want this
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
program um the enroles are the employees
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
that the employers pick so it's the
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
employers using this program as a tool
 
05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
to recruit who they think are the most
 
05:43:06.558 --> 05:43:08.310 align:start position:0%
to recruit who they think are the most
desirable

05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
desirable
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
employees um the average is like you
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
said 36,000 I assume that's because the
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
lower debt you have like the less the
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
less meaningful student debt forgiveness
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
is to recruit you right uh I had
 
05:43:25.390 --> 05:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
predicted it would be more like in the
 
05:43:28.110 --> 05:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
middle 25 but you don't see a lot of
 
05:43:30.070 --> 05:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
people on that 5,000 7,000 because
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're like I don't care if you forgive
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
my decks I don't have very much so it
 
05:43:35.350 --> 05:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't like needs-based at all it was
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
more to trying to get Talent recruit
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
talent and this was an incentive yes
 
05:43:44.350 --> 05:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right um it was this is a
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
this was a Workforce Development
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
recruitment strategy um the bfa's job
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
actually working with uh Granite Advance
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
formerly NE the New Hampshire higher
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
education assistance Foundation like
 
05:43:58.868 --> 05:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
we're just doing identity
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
verification checks in and out you know
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you fit the program you fit you fit
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
the program okay uh we don't charge
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
anything for it it's Pro bonus
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes sir I'm guessing this
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
is something the Senate threw in with
 
05:44:17.310 --> 05:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
pension I uh I do recall it came from
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate if I recall correctly yeah
 
05:44:24.990 --> 05:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
they added like a 100 pages to house
 
05:44:27.390 --> 05:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
build too so all right so one of the
 
05:44:29.310 --> 05:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
reasons I called you in was to ask about
 
05:44:31.628 --> 05:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
this because this is the company I'm
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
very familiar with yeah this is rust to
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
crust right so um so you loan the money
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
they went bankrupt a couple years
 
05:44:43.350 --> 05:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
later um so who lost
 
05:44:47.190 --> 05:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
out so great question um besides my
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
5-year-old who loves their Pizza um I
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there'll be any real losses
 
05:44:58.110 --> 05:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
um so we guaranteed two loans for rustic
 
05:45:01.310 --> 05:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
crust um one was a small equipment loan
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
of um I think it was like 800,000 and
 
05:45:07.750 --> 05:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
then one was to buy the the building
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
that they're in they were in two
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
buildings one rented one one purchased
 
05:45:14.468 --> 05:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
and that was um I think approximately
 
05:45:17.230 --> 05:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
three million for their manufacturing
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
facility so when so these were this was
 
05:45:22.990 --> 05:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
a bank loan the BFA backs
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
75% of any amount the bank loses after
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
they've pursued all the collateral and
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
by law we have to have at least an 80%
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
or better loan to value in order for us
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
to award the guarantee so the assets
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
have to be present with a discount
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
buffer to fully pay the guarantee and
 
05:45:47.868 --> 05:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
only if like we go below that buffer the
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
BFA covers a percentage of the
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
percentage below the buffer so um that
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
situation actually it was it's pretty
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
recent they went out of business this
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
year or no sorry late last year um yeah
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
late last year um they are still in the
 
05:46:09.468 --> 05:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
process of of of liquidation right so a
 
05:46:12.430 --> 05:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of the equipment has been sold the
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
equipment loan is almost fully paid and
 
05:46:17.590 --> 05:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
there's more equipment left to liquidate
 
05:46:20.590 --> 05:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
so we're very confident there um it's
 
05:46:22.350 --> 05:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
public record the appraisal on the
 
05:46:25.708 --> 05:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
building was $4 million the debt
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
outstanding is $3 million we're pretty
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
confident in today's market that the
 
05:46:33.868 --> 05:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
bank debt will be paid if it's not um
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to come out of the
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
statutorily required reserve the BFA has
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
to set aside when we do a loan guarantee
 
05:46:42.670 --> 05:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what will happen it's
 
05:46:42.680 --> 05:46:43.948 align:start position:0%
and that's what will happen it's
actually

05:46:43.948 --> 05:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of a sad story it's uh I
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
hate to say I don't want to say it's not
 
05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
the business's fault because of course
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's the business's fault um but they
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
were actually doing fairly well and they
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
had some expected significant investor
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
Capital that got pulled last minute due
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
to issues with the fund of the investor
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
not the company's performance and they
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
had spent all their money on a big new
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
contract that they were growing and next
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
thing you know there it was a liquidity
 
05:47:17.788 --> 05:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
issue so they couldn't order the flour
 
05:47:19.868 --> 05:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
to make their pizza so then the Flower
 
05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
company said well now your cash on
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
delivery where you had millions of
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
dollars of term of of vendor and it just
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
sort of very quickly went the wrong way
 
05:47:33.548 --> 05:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
the buyer of the assets on the equipment
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
is actually already up and running and I
 
05:47:37.110 --> 05:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
think I think the plan is to bring 9 of
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
those people back to work um and I think
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
they're already starting so when I say
 
05:47:43.468 --> 05:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
no one's going to lose out I actually
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
think it'll be in different hands but
 
05:47:49.510 --> 05:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
it'll be okay yeah I will lose that I
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
will because I'm I'm a was a shareholder
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
um but for many many years so anyway
 
05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
umor yeah and and the guy who bought it
 
05:48:02.070 --> 05:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
is from your board
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
actually yeah there was a uh a bid and
 
05:48:09.030 --> 05:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
he a fund he's part of yeah I think he
 
05:48:13.310 --> 05:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
did yeah okay so um other questions how
 
05:48:15.788 --> 05:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
are we doing I guess
 
05:48:18.750 --> 05:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
we're well it was just this was actually
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
the first I think it was the first in
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
Angel investment I made when I moved to
 
05:48:26.190 --> 05:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I I moved to New
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it'll be 20 years in
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
July so we've had this
 
05:48:36.190 --> 05:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
investment 18 years 19 something like
 
05:48:38.430 --> 05:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah so you saw like that was like
 
05:48:40.270 --> 05:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
the Foodies days you know that was just
 
05:48:40.280 --> 05:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
the Foodies days you know that was just
after

05:48:41.270 --> 05:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:48:44.788 --> 05:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
Foodies so I I know Brad and all that
 
05:48:47.548 --> 05:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and it was the next town over
 
05:48:49.948 --> 05:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
it's in Pittsfield so that's that was
 
05:48:52.830 --> 05:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
kind of interesting all right so um what
 
05:48:55.990 --> 05:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
do we got next here judicial
 
05:48:58.510 --> 05:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
brand and nobody's
 
05:49:01.310 --> 05:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
here oh they're out in the hall okay and
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much great there there
 
05:49:05.468 --> 05:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
was one other questions uh Mr chairman
 
05:49:07.468 --> 05:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
there was one other General fund program
 
05:49:09.548 --> 05:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
I want I don't know if on here if it's
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
if you want me to talk so uh last year
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
no two years ago um the state approved a
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
$200,000 pery year grant for nine
 
05:49:22.270 --> 05:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
Regional development corporations it was
 
05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
10 now it's nine um one merged with
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
another and it's a capacity Grant no
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
strings attached to those groups it's a
 
05:49:29.920 --> 05:49:30.910 align:start position:0%
strings attached to those groups it's a
10-year

05:49:30.910 --> 05:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
05:49:33.468 --> 05:49:33.478 align:start position:0%
authorization the state uh I'm not
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
actually 100% sure why but asked the BFA
 
05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
if we would kind of take that money in
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
divide by 10 now by nine send the checks
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
out we do that um so I think
 
05:49:48.670 --> 05:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
technically I think technically we
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
receive those General funds and then uh
 
05:49:53.708 --> 05:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
we send them so in full disclosure Mr
 
05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%

we are and what we do second to give you
 
05:53:28.948 --> 05:53:28.958 align:start position:0%

the first part of our presentation if
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's okay with the division I'd like to
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of tag team so my
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues can get up here and talk
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
about their respective courts uh slide
 
05:53:57.510 --> 05:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
four you see the basic structure of the
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh we have two trial
 
05:54:02.070 --> 05:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
courts the superior court and the
 
05:54:05.310 --> 05:54:05.320 align:start position:0%

Hampshire the Supreme Court court and we
 
05:54:09.670 --> 05:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
are all supported by the administrative
 
05:54:11.708 --> 05:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
office of the court so that's the
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
depiction on the left side uh now I'd
 
05:54:17.510 --> 05:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
like to turn it over to uh judges
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
Court good afternoon thank you for
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
having us in today appreciate it so
 
05:54:35.468 --> 05:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
starting on uh Slide Five and I
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
apologize if it's done and if you
 
05:54:39.110 --> 05:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
already know the structure but I'm just
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
so we can uh have a baseline so
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
everybody is familiar with it uh the
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court is the largest of the
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
courts uh in the state um we often refer
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
to it as the People's Court because this
 
05:54:53.310 --> 05:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
is where 80 to 85% of citizens of New
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who access the court system
 
05:54:57.628 --> 05:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
come to the Circuit
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
Court um we have three divisions the
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
district family and probate divisions uh
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court was created in 2011 as
 
05:55:12.110 --> 05:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
a result of cre of uh condensing those
 
05:55:15.548 --> 05:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
three courts uh into one with just one
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things to uh to note
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
about the Circuit Court uh one of it
 
05:55:31.070 --> 05:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
which is that a significant majority of
 
05:55:32.830 --> 05:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
the litigants who come to Circuit Court
 
05:55:32.840 --> 05:55:33.590 align:start position:0%
the litigants who come to Circuit Court
are

05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:55:35.548 --> 05:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
self-represented uh there are some case
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
types where we actually have 90% of
 
05:55:39.788 --> 05:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
litigants that are
 
05:55:41.948 --> 05:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
self-represented uh so that is something
 
05:55:44.910 --> 05:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
that is in the top of our minds as we uh
 
05:55:48.510 --> 05:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
do anything in the court uh in addition
 
05:55:51.070 --> 05:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
to the trial court the Circuit Court
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
also oversees a number of programs or
 
05:55:55.628 --> 05:55:55.638 align:start position:0%
units um I'm not going to list them all
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
but a few of them include the uh
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
information center which I'll talk more
 
05:56:04.390 --> 05:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
about in a moment the domestic violence
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
registry the office of arbitration and
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
mediation we do over 2,000 uh mediations
 
05:56:12.430 --> 05:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
a year out of that in a number of
 
05:56:14.910 --> 05:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
different case types and also the
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
central processing center uh which I
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
just want to mention briefly provides
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
record checks for non-confidential court
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
records uh we get over 21,000 requests a
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
year and this actually uh Revenue excuse
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
me generates revenue of over 5 million a
 
05:56:35.230 --> 05:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
year uh that goes into the general
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
fund switching to um slide six just to
 
05:56:42.270 --> 05:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
give you a brief overview of the
 
05:56:45.310 --> 05:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
geography of the Circuit Court uh we are
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
split into 10 circuits they reflect the
 
05:56:51.628 --> 05:56:51.638 align:start position:0%
10 uh counties in the state however
 
05:56:54.468 --> 05:56:54.478 align:start position:0%
within each one of those circuits are uh
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
multiple courts you'll see those listed
 
05:57:01.150 --> 05:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
um so for instance in Rockingham County
 
05:57:04.390 --> 05:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's the 10th circuit uh we have six
 
05:57:06.990 --> 05:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
courts brenwood Candia Dairy Hampton
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Salem um the idea being that
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're intended to be Community cour
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
houses uh that reflect and are easy for
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
people to get to and access Justice uh
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
of those 34 locations there's 10 probate
 
05:57:23.708 --> 05:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
divisions that reflects one in each
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
County uh 31 District divisions and 31
 
05:57:27.478 --> 05:57:28.910 align:start position:0%
County uh 31 District divisions and 31
family

05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
divisions so flipping to slide
 
05:57:37.628 --> 05:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
seven uh Circuit Court judges we have 49
 
05:57:41.150 --> 05:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
full-time judges uh each of those judges
 
05:57:43.990 --> 05:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
does at a minimum uh district and family
 
05:57:46.468 --> 05:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
divisions about a third of them also do
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
probate because not all the judges are
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
seated in a county seat uh which is
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
where we do
 
05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
probate uh in addition to our 39
 
05:57:57.468 --> 05:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
full-time judges we have a number of
 
05:58:00.390 --> 05:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
part-time judges um so there's three
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
actual part-time or per Dums uh there's
 
05:58:04.990 --> 05:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
four who are Judges who are on senior
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
status those are are Judges who have
 
05:58:10.510 --> 05:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
retired uh but not reached the age of 70
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
so they sit part-time and bless you and
 
05:58:18.910 --> 05:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
16 judicial referees those are uh former
 
05:58:21.990 --> 05:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
judges who have reached the age of 70 um
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we appoint them as a Judicial
 
05:58:26.468 --> 05:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
referee to come back and sit uh
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
part-time either on cases or some of
 
05:58:31.468 --> 05:58:31.478 align:start position:0%
them uh do neutral case
 
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh a docket of that in the
 
05:58:36.110 --> 05:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
Family Division for divorce and
 
05:58:36.120 --> 05:58:38.070 align:start position:0%
Family Division for divorce and
parenting

05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
05:58:43.150 --> 05:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
cases um we also have two uh complex
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
dockets one family and one trust docket
 
05:58:48.590 --> 05:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
we have two judges who were assigned
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to take those complex cases
 
05:58:53.708 --> 05:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh from around the
 
05:58:57.230 --> 05:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
state are any of these um judicial
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
positions um empty at the moment they
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
are not those are those are all full
 
05:59:02.878 --> 05:59:04.910 align:start position:0%
are not those are those are all full
thank

05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
you uh moving to slide
 
05:59:11.948 --> 05:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
eight um this gives you a sense of our
 
05:59:11.958 --> 05:59:13.270 align:start position:0%
eight um this gives you a sense of our
court

05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:59:18.548 --> 05:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
filings uh this past year we've got
 
05:59:18.558 --> 05:59:20.270 align:start position:0%
filings uh this past year we've got
131,132

05:59:20.270 --> 05:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
131,132
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh that reflects new court cases also
 
05:59:26.548 --> 05:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
reflects reopened cases and for those of
 
05:59:29.230 --> 05:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
you who don't know a reopened case uh
 
05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
might mean I'll give you an example a
 
05:59:33.270 --> 05:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
divorce case that has been fully
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and is closed but some
 
05:59:38.110 --> 05:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
someone comes back later to for instance
 
05:59:41.230 --> 05:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
change a parenting plan or uh modify
 
05:59:43.070 --> 05:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
something in the decree so that case
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
gets reopened um so we count that as a
 
05:59:47.670 --> 05:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
as a new Case in essence because it's a
 
05:59:50.548 --> 05:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
new case that's coming in that year um
 
05:59:54.670 --> 05:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
so we are up uh this represents a 15%
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
increase over new filings from
 
06:00:01.510 --> 06:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
2023 um and specifically a 21% increase
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
in criminal
 
06:00:06.190 --> 06:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
cases uh from 2023 um which which we
 
06:00:08.910 --> 06:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
believe represents primarily a return of
 
06:00:13.310 --> 06:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
felonies into uh the Circuit
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
Court just gives you a listing here uh
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
it breaks out the types of filings I'm
 
06:00:18.990 --> 06:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
not going to go through all of them you
 
06:00:20.830 --> 06:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
can read them but it breaks out the
 
06:00:26.910 --> 06:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
divisions are
 
06:00:31.390 --> 06:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
there all these felony cases are those
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
with juries or no so there are no juries
 
06:00:37.468 --> 06:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court okay so the felonies
 
06:00:39.230 --> 06:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
that have come back to Circuit Court
 
06:00:41.868 --> 06:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
what happens is they uh all of the
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
criminal charges are filed initially in
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court both felonies and
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors now uh they get an
 
06:00:50.830 --> 06:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
arraignment bail hearings uh and all of
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
the PIM in a probable cause hearing in
 
06:00:55.830 --> 06:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
circuit court if the circuit court judge
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
finds probable cause it is bound the
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
case is then bound over to Superior
 
06:01:00.840 --> 06:01:02.430 align:start position:0%
case is then bound over to Superior
Court

06:01:02.430 --> 06:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
Court
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:11.590 --> 06:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
a criminal defendant has the option to
 
06:01:15.990 --> 06:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:16.000 --> 06:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
to

06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
um moving on to slide nine uh I just
 
06:01:24.350 --> 06:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
want to briefly mention the judicial
 
06:01:26.350 --> 06:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
branch information center this was
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
created in
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
2012 we have approximately 30 uh staff
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
people who take over 400,000 calls a
 
06:01:37.868 --> 06:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
year um um again this is incredibly
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
important and critical for our
 
06:01:42.830 --> 06:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants um and I will
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
tell you that the
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
approximately uh 25 of these calls get
 
06:01:51.390 --> 06:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
sent or forwarded on to the actual local
 
06:01:53.788 --> 06:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
court but that means that the call
 
06:01:56.910 --> 06:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
center is handling approximately 300,000
 
06:02:00.468 --> 06:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
calls a year that don't have to go into
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
our local courts which allows our local
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
staff to concentrate more on either
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
processing cases or um serving the
 
06:02:14.468 --> 06:02:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
thing I'm GNA turn it over to judge
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
Kissinger who's going to talk about the
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh new magistrate program okay so this
 
06:02:22.590 --> 06:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
year we started uh as a effective
 
06:02:25.230 --> 06:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
January 1 the new magistrate program
 
06:02:27.548 --> 06:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
however they were hired by December 2nd
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they had four weeks of training
 
06:02:33.628 --> 06:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
before um the January 2 start date um
 
06:02:35.868 --> 06:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
and then they had additional few weeks
 
06:02:39.670 --> 06:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
weeks of uh shadowing judges um and also
 
06:02:41.708 --> 06:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
um circling back on additional training
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that they determined they would need the
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
important thing about the magistrate
 
06:02:48.110 --> 06:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
program is that we're finding is that um
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
they engage in certain key functions
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
that our Circuit Court judges undertake
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and that frees those judicial
 
06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
resources to go to other case types um
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
and to help um in particular freeze
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
judicial uh resources for case types
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
that aren't statut mandated that may get
 
06:03:10.990 --> 06:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
um delayed because we are doing the the
 
06:03:13.868 --> 06:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
cases that need to be T undertaken
 
06:03:16.468 --> 06:03:16.478 align:start position:0%
immediately um um as I said on January
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
1st they began the weekend um or holiday
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
coverage um and they um will do bail
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
determinations for a number of different
 
06:03:31.230 --> 06:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
um serious crimes that is enumerated in
 
06:03:32.670 --> 06:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
the statute there's there's a number of
 
06:03:34.350 --> 06:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
them I I won't go through the list but I
 
06:03:37.110 --> 06:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
can certainly if you if you want me to
 
06:03:40.750 --> 06:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
um they also um do weekday
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
arraignments and they do uh bail reviews
 
06:03:47.230 --> 06:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
they do probable cause hearings and they
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh can review warrants both arrest and
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
search warrants um they've I personally
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
um am in charge of when a judge calls in
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
sick to find coverage and I can tell you
 
06:04:02.110 --> 06:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
we've already tapped our referees um so
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
I thank the legislature for that um and
 
06:04:07.948 --> 06:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
um they provide Statewide coverage for
 
06:04:09.310 --> 06:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
when we need to have a next day
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
arraignment or warrant taken care of um
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
and what this allows is when if there's
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
professional development um the those
 
06:04:21.350 --> 06:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
arraignments those warrants get covered
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
while the judges are undergoing the
 
06:04:25.830 --> 06:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
professional development which frankly
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
is is quite important we we're doing a
 
06:04:30.390 --> 06:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
lot of refresh trainings because we
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
cover such a broad spectrum of cases
 
06:04:37.390 --> 06:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
across three divisions um we also
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
importantly during the weekday they do
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
bail determinations uh for local police
 
06:04:44.750 --> 06:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
departments so the local police
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
department can bring the arreste to the
 
06:04:48.830 --> 06:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
local court and have a bail
 
06:04:50.910 --> 06:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
determination with a magistrate either
 
06:04:54.030 --> 06:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
in person or over video and that creates
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for the courts because then
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
if we don't need to use staff members
 
06:05:01.750 --> 06:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
who are bail Commissioners and they can
 
06:05:03.468 --> 06:05:03.478 align:start position:0%
service the other members of our
 
06:05:06.270 --> 06:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
community um this is particularly in our
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
rural um courts because um often times
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find a bell commissioner in
 
06:05:15.310 --> 06:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
a in a more rural area um so that's
 
06:05:19.830 --> 06:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's quite important so um again go
 
06:05:21.788 --> 06:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
are these positions appointed by the
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
governor or
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
no no
 
06:05:29.150 --> 06:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
no so the uh positions are appointed by
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice that's uh the way the
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh reads um and we uh judge
 
06:05:38.590 --> 06:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
Howard just Howard uh was in charge of a
 
06:05:41.110 --> 06:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
search committee and uh we did all of
 
06:05:43.390 --> 06:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
the interviewing uh sent finalist
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
candidates for interviewing an
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
appointment by the Chief Justice and
 
06:05:48.670 --> 06:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
they're not part of the judge's
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
retirement system and stuff like that is
 
06:05:54.750 --> 06:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct they are similar
 
06:05:58.390 --> 06:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
to um a a referee uh not a Judicial
 
06:06:01.070 --> 06:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
referee but uh a referee in our system
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
so they're an employee yes
 
06:06:05.110 --> 06:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
classification thank you uh other
 
06:06:08.110 --> 06:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you Mr chair um I
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
believe in the bill we authorized it was
 
06:06:12.868 --> 06:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
more than three didn't we authorize 10
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
or five was a how you doing on getting
 
06:06:18.510 --> 06:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
the so I'm gonna I'm gonna let the chief
 
06:06:21.548 --> 06:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
handle that one okay believe the bail
 
06:06:23.590 --> 06:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
Reform Bill uh authorized three
 
06:06:25.670 --> 06:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
initially and permitted me to go back to
 
06:06:29.390 --> 06:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal and ask for two additional okay
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
and uh are you going to follow up on
 
06:06:33.548 --> 06:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
that uh we're we're we just launched
 
06:06:34.750 --> 06:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
this so we're going to assess the
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
workload and
 
06:06:38.110 --> 06:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
and uh make a determination down the
 
06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
road okay thank you thank you at this
 
06:06:43.788 --> 06:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
point um we're going to turn it over to
 
06:06:52.670 --> 06:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:55.390 --> 06:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
court right uh good afternoon just as a
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
reminder I'm Mark Howard I'm the chief
 
06:06:59.390 --> 06:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
judge of the Superior Court uh the
 
06:07:01.150 --> 06:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
Superior Court as I'm sure you know is a
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional court it's established in
 
06:07:04.510 --> 06:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
part two article
 
06:07:07.868 --> 06:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
72a um we are the court of general trial
 
06:07:09.868 --> 06:07:09.878 align:start position:0%
court jurisdiction uh here in New
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what that means is um we
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh conduct all jury trials in felony uh
 
06:07:19.150 --> 06:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
cases some misdemeanor cases all civil
 
06:07:21.910 --> 06:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
cases uh to a certain
 
06:07:24.670 --> 06:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
um uh monetary
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
threshold um there is the right to a
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
jury trial in civil cases in our state
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
under our constitution where the minimum
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
is $1,500 so you can well imagine that
 
06:07:36.110 --> 06:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
that increases our uh
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
dock it quite a bit um is that a a
 
06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional it is $1,500 yeah around
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
a long time I see okay all right so
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
maybe we can work on
 
06:07:53.468 --> 06:07:53.478 align:start position:0%
that um we also have uh what was created
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
in 2023 the land use docket U we were
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
given an additional judge committed to
 
06:08:00.510 --> 06:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
that effort and we have the business and
 
06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
Commercial dispute docket uh the land
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
use docket sits in Manchester as does
 
06:08:07.590 --> 06:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the business and Commercial
 
06:08:10.990 --> 06:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
dispute uh we also house uh many of our
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
treatment courts all of the drug courts
 
06:08:14.910 --> 06:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are in Superior Court
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh we are developing mental health
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
courts in Superior Court they also exist
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh primarily in Circuit Court uh and uh
 
06:08:24.788 --> 06:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature authorized the creation
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the veterans court um beginning this
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
year in the middle of this year my
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's not funded yet
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
but it's been created to have a veterans
 
06:08:34.708 --> 06:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
court in each of our counties throughout
 
06:08:37.230 --> 06:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
the state uh we also started a pilot
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
program of what we refer to as a young
 
06:08:40.750 --> 06:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
adult uh treatment court and I'm going
 
06:08:42.670 --> 06:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
to get into this more uh later in the
 
06:08:44.830 --> 06:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
presentation that's in Manchester and
 
06:08:47.948 --> 06:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
the focus essentially is on um
 
06:08:49.708 --> 06:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
defendants who are between the ages of
 
06:08:53.430 --> 06:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
18 and 25 they're usually come from uh
 
06:08:55.868 --> 06:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
Gang Related associations and we try to
 
06:08:58.430 --> 06:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
get them out of the gangs and provide
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
them uh treatment and uh counseling
 
06:09:03.230 --> 06:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
through uh the court
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
supervision the superior court is a
 
06:09:09.030 --> 06:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
County based court so we have 11 sites
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
um Hillsboro has two sites Manchester
 
06:09:13.948 --> 06:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
and nashwa and then every other county
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
has one site in the county
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
seat our census is uh 23 full-time
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
judges that's 22 who actively sit plus
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
the chief um and we are at full
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
compliment right now um we are expecting
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
although it's not mandatory we're
 
06:09:33.030 --> 06:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
expecting a retirement later this
 
06:09:36.110 --> 06:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
year we have two senior active status
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
judges what that means is a judge who
 
06:09:42.390 --> 06:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
has retired but is not yet aged 70 uh so
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
they still have full Authority as a
 
06:09:46.110 --> 06:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
judge and but they are limited in the
 
06:09:47.868 --> 06:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
amount of time that they can sit it's
 
06:09:50.830 --> 06:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
basically 25% of a full-time
 
06:09:53.390 --> 06:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
judge and then we have four judicial
 
06:09:55.510 --> 06:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
referees that is fully retired judges
 
06:09:58.270 --> 06:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
over the age of 70 they no longer have
 
06:10:00.110 --> 06:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional authorities but they
 
06:10:01.788 --> 06:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
still handle some matters for us
 
06:10:03.468 --> 06:10:03.478 align:start position:0%
particularly in the area of settlements
 
06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
and uh arbitrations and mediation in in
 
06:10:06.600 --> 06:10:15.670 align:start position:0%
and uh arbitrations and mediation in in
Superior

06:10:15.670 --> 06:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
Court Supreme Court the one Appel Court
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
in our state five justices one Chief and
 
06:10:22.430 --> 06:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
four associate
 
06:10:26.190 --> 06:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
justices uh in addition to our pellet
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh we have
 
06:10:30.390 --> 06:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility generally with respect to
 
06:10:32.190 --> 06:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
the oversight of legal profession in New
 
06:10:34.590 --> 06:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including attorney admission
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
attorney dis IPL liaison with the New
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association which U
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
so-called unified bar and the
 
06:10:43.510 --> 06:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
development of court rules under our
 
06:10:46.110 --> 06:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
constitution is the Chief Justice and
 
06:10:48.110 --> 06:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with the associate Justice
 
06:10:50.030 --> 06:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
who have ultimate responsibility for the
 
06:10:54.670 --> 06:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch on slide 17 you will see
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
our uh case load this is for calendar
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
24 um and the the real measure of our
 
06:11:07.030 --> 06:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
productivity is that uh bottom um number
 
06:11:09.868 --> 06:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
752 of the cases that flowed through our
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
court were finally resolved that I will
 
06:11:14.190 --> 06:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
note for the record is the highest
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
number since 2015 so a very productive
 
06:11:19.270 --> 06:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
year last year uh with that I'll ask
 
06:11:22.030 --> 06:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
director Marner come up Mr chief justice
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
yes can you explain the difference
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
between cases accepted and full court
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
arguments heard so you can take a case
 
06:11:32.830 --> 06:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
but not actually hear it sort of is that
 
06:11:36.430 --> 06:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes that we we have a volume of cases
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
about 750 a year we elect to have oral
 
06:11:43.910 --> 06:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
argument and opinions published where a
 
06:11:45.868 --> 06:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
case is going to affect the development
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the law in other words where statute
 
06:11:50.430 --> 06:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
which hasn't been interpreted before
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
needs interpretation by us or the common
 
06:11:55.270 --> 06:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
law will be will be Advanced the other
 
06:11:58.468 --> 06:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
cases are disposed of by by court order
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
and and some cases are not we we have a
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
large mandatory jurisdiction but some is
 
06:12:05.390 --> 06:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary and some cases are
 
06:12:08.670 --> 06:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
disposed of by not accepting them so you
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
make your decision by reading what
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
happened in the case is that all all of
 
06:12:17.548 --> 06:12:17.558 align:start position:0%
the cases have five sets of eyes on them
 
06:12:20.190 --> 06:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
and um they're resolved either by
 
06:12:23.830 --> 06:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
opinion or by order gotcha thank you
 
06:12:30.750 --> 06:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:33.350 --> 06:12:33.360 align:start position:0%

for the courts um we provide all the
 
06:12:44.670 --> 06:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
typical things that you would expect it
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
um HR accounting fiscal Donna leads our
 
06:12:51.190 --> 06:12:51.200 align:start position:0%

audits on our on our internal um
operations

06:13:05.830 --> 06:13:05.840 align:start position:0%

um Communications a is here so he's in
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
the AOC um treatment Court coordination
 
06:13:14.430 --> 06:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court transferred to the AOC
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the in this bium actually and so we
 
06:13:19.830 --> 06:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
just do the administrative support for
 
06:13:22.830 --> 06:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
that um access and Community
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
engagement uh justice data and
 
06:13:28.110 --> 06:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
statistics Information Technology that's
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
probably our biggest uh spending piece
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
other than court security and and we
 
06:13:34.468 --> 06:13:34.478 align:start position:0%
have procurement and purchasing
 
06:13:36.990 --> 06:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and buildings and grounds one
 
06:13:39.430 --> 06:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
thing that you may not know that we do
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
is Provide support for some of the other
 
06:13:43.628 --> 06:13:43.638 align:start position:0%
offices that are part of the court so
 
06:13:46.150 --> 06:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
YDC claims which the legislator
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislature created is actually in
 
06:13:50.990 --> 06:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
supported by the AOC the attorney
 
06:13:53.070 --> 06:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
discipline office the officer of bar
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
Admissions and the judicial conduct
 
06:13:57.468 --> 06:13:57.478 align:start position:0%
committee so there are a lot of
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
different um functions that we support I
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to call out a few noteworthy
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
things that are that are different and
 
06:14:07.150 --> 06:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
everyone does a great job but in the
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
recent past we stood up a grants unit
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that unit has been able to since
 
06:14:16.390 --> 06:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
2022 and it started um get $26 million
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
in Grants and and you'll see later that
 
06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
that money is what's supporting most of
 
06:14:23.150 --> 06:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
the new initiatives we're doing in the
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
branch it's not General funds um and the
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
office of access and Community
 
06:14:30.390 --> 06:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
engagement which the Supreme Court
 
06:14:33.868 --> 06:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
started about a little over a year ago
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of projects to
 
06:14:37.708 --> 06:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
support proa litigants coming into the
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
courts and so those are funded with
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
grants as well and last we started a
 
06:14:45.310 --> 06:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
procurement and Purchasing Office which
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
has done some really great work at
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
reducing costs and trying to look for
 
06:14:52.350 --> 06:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
efficiencies couple examples toners that
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
we used to pay uh $100 for we just got
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
uh for 16 and envelopes regular order
 
06:15:02.070 --> 06:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
consistently paid the same amount $200
 
06:15:04.110 --> 06:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
off so they're doing a really good job
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
trying to earn their salaries
 
06:15:12.628 --> 06:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
so do you not have access to Department
 
06:15:15.390 --> 06:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services purchasing we
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
do so we can share in the benefits of
 
06:15:20.310 --> 06:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
their contracts if they are things that
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
we use and in some cases there are other
 
06:15:25.548 --> 06:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
things that we use um we have different
 
06:15:28.150 --> 06:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
Services we use different things so
 
06:15:29.670 --> 06:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
anytime we can if their prices are
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
better but we like to try to beat them
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
you representative w
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh when was the last time we
 
06:15:40.510 --> 06:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
updated the filing fees so I'm actually

06:15:44.190 --> 06:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
information and I gathered it yesterday
 
06:15:46.468 --> 06:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
from the chief's um clerk at the Supreme
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
Court because they're all set by Supreme
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
Court so it they have varied and changed
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
over time but I'm going to get you a
 
06:16:02.190 --> 06:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
welcome so beginning on slide 20 uh just
 
06:16:05.920 --> 06:16:06.868 align:start position:0%
welcome so beginning on slide 20 uh just
very

06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:16:10.110 --> 06:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
briefly um share with the committee some
 
06:16:12.510 --> 06:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
of what we think are challenges and
 
06:16:15.390 --> 06:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities slide 21 is a
 
06:16:15.400 --> 06:16:17.510 align:start position:0%
opportunities slide 21 is a
list

06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
list
 
06:16:21.110 --> 06:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
um so let me start with challenges and
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
the first one on slide 22 is Safety and
 
06:16:24.240 --> 06:16:26.390 align:start position:0%
the first one on slide 22 is Safety and
Security

06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
Security
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um there is one issue that keeps me up
 
06:16:30.708 --> 06:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
at night and that is the Safety and
 
06:16:32.468 --> 06:16:32.478 align:start position:0%
Security of the thousands of people who
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
walk through our 40 plus doors every day
 
06:16:38.468 --> 06:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
and our Safety and Security is provided
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
in sort of a bifurcated way our County
 
06:16:44.788 --> 06:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
Sheriffs provide safety security in our
 
06:16:47.948 --> 06:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
uh Superior cour houses and AOC
 
06:16:50.628 --> 06:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
employees court security officers
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
provide security in our circuit courts
 
06:16:56.708 --> 06:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
with the support of the legislature
 
06:16:58.590 --> 06:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
we've made some really significant
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
progress on this front our court
 
06:17:04.230 --> 06:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
security officers are now able to be
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
trained by a special curriculum
 
06:17:07.628 --> 06:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
developed at the police standards and
 
06:17:11.110 --> 06:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
training Council because of legislation
 
06:17:15.788 --> 06:17:15.798 align:start position:0%
enacted by uh the legislature we've also
 
06:17:17.948 --> 06:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh benefited from arpa funds one-time
 
06:17:20.750 --> 06:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
spending but we are doing one-time
 
06:17:23.548 --> 06:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
assessments of each one of our physical
 
06:17:27.190 --> 06:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
locations to uh to be able to catalog
 
06:17:28.868 --> 06:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that we might be able to
 
06:17:31.230 --> 06:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature and
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
identify um next I'm going to ask Chief
 
06:17:36.788 --> 06:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
Justice to to talk about the YDC
 
06:17:39.030 --> 06:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
challenge we face on slide
 
06:17:41.468 --> 06:17:41.478 align:start position:0%
23 so just by way of a little bit of
 
06:17:43.110 --> 06:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
background as you know the Youth
 
06:17:44.990 --> 06:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Development Center has been the subject
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
of a lot of litigation and the claims
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
process that was created by the
 
06:17:51.788 --> 06:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislature a few years ago um those
 
06:17:51.798 --> 06:17:53.548 align:start position:0%
legislature a few years ago um those
cases

06:17:53.548 --> 06:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
cases
 
06:17:56.468 --> 06:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
um although about 800 of them have gone
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
to the claims process there's an
 
06:17:58.320 --> 06:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
to the claims process there's an
additional

06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:18:02.030 --> 06:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
1350 plus or minus in the Superior
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
Courts that are in full litigation in
 
06:18:05.468 --> 06:18:05.478 align:start position:0%
the Superior Courts
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
those cases have um created a extremely
 
06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:11.478 align:start position:0%
significant resource crisis for the
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
Superior Court both in terms of
 
06:18:15.628 --> 06:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
Administration staff in the clerk's
 
06:18:18.030 --> 06:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
offices that have to administer we have
 
06:18:20.948 --> 06:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
an electronic filing system the manager
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the electronic filing system center
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
um literally Works night and day just
 
06:18:28.468 --> 06:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
keeping up with the YDC
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
cases um that's in addition to our other
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
22,000 cases that we have filed every
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
year in thisi
 
06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
fors um these uh cases will are going to
 
06:18:41.430 --> 06:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
be around for years and just so you're
 
06:18:44.310 --> 06:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
are clear about it the the claims
 
06:18:46.788 --> 06:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
process is only for cases where the
 
06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
state is the defendant uh the state is
 
06:18:53.230 --> 06:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
being sued there are about 520 cases
 
06:18:55.628 --> 06:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
where although the state is a defendant
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the other defendants and the primary
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
defendants in those cases is private
 
06:19:02.230 --> 06:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
contractors who contracted with the
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
state to run youth homes um uh
 
06:19:07.948 --> 06:19:07.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the state during those years
 
06:19:11.230 --> 06:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
um so even if all of the cases and so
 
06:19:13.310 --> 06:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
far almost none of them have left the
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
superior court and gone to the claims
 
06:19:16.990 --> 06:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
process only about a hundred in the last
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
quarter have actually gone to the claims
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
process even if all of them go to the
 
06:19:23.948 --> 06:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
claims process the Superior Court will
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
still have to deal with about 520 of
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
these extremely complex cases I'm sure
 
06:19:31.350 --> 06:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
many of you saw the news on the mean
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
case uh last year about just how complex
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
those cases are nearly all of them are
 
06:19:36.638 --> 06:19:39.230 align:start position:0%
those cases are nearly all of them are
like

06:19:39.230 --> 06:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you chief justice Howard
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
slide 24 refers to a chall oh I'm sorry
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
so oh yes last time when we dealt with
 
06:19:51.868 --> 06:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
allocating the money to pay the
 
06:19:54.110 --> 06:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
settlements um the Attorney General said
 
06:19:57.948 --> 06:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
to us it's up to us how much we let
 
06:20:00.830 --> 06:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
somebody sue us you know what I mean we
 
06:20:04.030 --> 06:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
could pass a law saying everybody gets
 
06:20:04.040 --> 06:20:05.310 align:start position:0%
could pass a law saying everybody gets
$10,000

06:20:05.310 --> 06:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000
 
06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
or something is that is that accurate or
 
06:20:11.868 --> 06:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
is that you know so one of the great
 
06:20:13.830 --> 06:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
Parts about being a judge is I can't
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
give legal advice
 
06:20:19.788 --> 06:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to have to defer to the
 
06:20:21.910 --> 06:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on the state's ability
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
to both um impose sovereign immunity
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is you can't suici at all or the
 
06:20:29.548 --> 06:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
limits and what the Constitutional
 
06:20:33.310 --> 06:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
limits are of uh how much you can cap a
 
06:20:35.708 --> 06:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
recovery that issue is actually in
 
06:20:38.390 --> 06:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
litigation in that mean case right now I
 
06:20:43.150 --> 06:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
you slide 24 refers to the third
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
challenge we've identified broadly
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
called access to Justice and I want to
 
06:20:52.190 --> 06:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
make clear this is
 
06:20:55.150 --> 06:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
not solely a New Hampshire problem it is
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
truly a national problem and as you
 
06:21:00.390 --> 06:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
heard from Judge Christo up to 90% in
 
06:21:02.788 --> 06:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
particular case types in our Circuit
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
Court have a self represented litigant
 
06:21:08.070 --> 06:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
that is a litigant without an attorney
 
06:21:10.910 --> 06:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
on one one or both sides of the
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
V uh on and that's the Civil side on the
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
criminal side where our constitutions
 
06:21:18.958 --> 06:21:20.350 align:start position:0%
criminal side where our constitutions
both

06:21:20.350 --> 06:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
require uh that c the criminally accused
 
06:21:26.548 --> 06:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
have an attorney be appointed we're
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
facing another kind of Crisis which is
 
06:21:31.990 --> 06:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
the public defender office is simply not
 
06:21:35.628 --> 06:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
able to provide enough attorney repres
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
representation for all the criminal
 
06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
defendants out there the LBA I commend
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh an LBA audit of the judicial Council
 
06:21:46.270 --> 06:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
judicial Council it's not part of the
 
06:21:47.708 --> 06:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
judicial branch it's part of the
 
06:21:50.070 --> 06:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
executive branch they did an audit last
 
06:21:52.110 --> 06:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
October it's well worth reading and
 
06:21:54.468 --> 06:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
you'll see in there that in March of
 
06:21:57.070 --> 06:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
2023 uh between 20 and
 
06:21:57.080 --> 06:21:58.590 align:start position:0%
2023 uh between 20 and
40

06:21:58.590 --> 06:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
40
 
06:21:58.600 --> 06:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
40
uh

06:22:00.230 --> 06:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:22:02.830 --> 06:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated defendants incarcerated
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
their Liberty withheld uh were awaiting
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
appointment of attorney before they
 
06:22:09.390 --> 06:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
could come to our courts this has an
 
06:22:11.708 --> 06:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
effect on our courts I think our trial
 
06:22:15.868 --> 06:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
judges would say uh without uh attorney
 
06:22:18.868 --> 06:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
representation it it slows the
 
06:22:21.190 --> 06:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
processing of the
 
06:22:24.670 --> 06:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
case um back to the Civil side I do want
 
06:22:26.750 --> 06:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
to commend the legislature for stepping
 
06:22:30.910 --> 06:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
up uh to help us address this issue last
 
06:22:33.468 --> 06:22:33.478 align:start position:0%
year uh the the legislature passed a
 
06:22:34.990 --> 06:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
very important bill
 
06:22:37.390 --> 06:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
which allows paralal
 
06:22:40.230 --> 06:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
representation in circuit courts in
 
06:22:42.990 --> 06:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
certain ta case types Statewide this was
 
06:22:45.468 --> 06:22:45.478 align:start position:0%
an important initiative of uh then
 
06:22:49.990 --> 06:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon and uh we're we're
 
06:22:53.868 --> 06:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh very hopeful about the ability to
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
provide at least some representation in
 
06:22:59.868 --> 06:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
our circuit courts by paral leals so I I
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to commend the legislature for that
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
and uh I also uh want to note that we
 
06:23:09.468 --> 06:23:09.478 align:start position:0%
are using one-time arpa funds to assist
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
our efforts uh to
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
identify means to assist
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
self-representative litigant in our
 
06:23:18.990 --> 06:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
courts representative cell and then
 
06:23:22.510 --> 06:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
representative MTS thank you Mr chair um
 
06:23:25.708 --> 06:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
so without legal representation what's
 
06:23:28.750 --> 06:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
the percentage of or chances of the
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
people winning their
 
06:23:33.948 --> 06:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
case uh our trial judges do they're very
 
06:23:38.510 --> 06:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
very very best to to be fair and
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
impartial with notwithstanding whether a
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
person is represented or not represented
 
06:23:46.350 --> 06:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
so that's a I think an impossible
 
06:23:49.990 --> 06:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
question to answer with respect do
 
06:23:53.590 --> 06:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
is as an attorney as someone who's been
 
06:23:55.510 --> 06:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
in court as someone who's been in court
 
06:23:58.788 --> 06:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
against um a self-re represented
 
06:24:02.030 --> 06:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
litigant is it difficult for a self
 
06:24:03.788 --> 06:24:03.798 align:start position:0%
representative litigant to walk into
 
06:24:06.310 --> 06:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
court a completely foreign atmosphere
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
where they speak a different
 
06:24:11.230 --> 06:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
language and achieve the same level of
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
Justice I would say not okay and our
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
entire profession is letting down the
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
people of not just New Hampshire but the
 
06:24:20.830 --> 06:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
entire country as I said this is a
 
06:24:23.230 --> 06:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
national problem and we need to do
 
06:24:26.150 --> 06:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
better about on it okay thank
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
06:24:30.910 --> 06:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
chief justice for taking my question is
 
06:24:33.670 --> 06:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there a constitutional limit on how
 
06:24:36.910 --> 06:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
long someone can be held without having
 
06:24:36.920 --> 06:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
long someone can be held without having
a

06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
council um so there's no Hardon task
 
06:24:45.350 --> 06:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
limit but at some point without councel
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
the the defendant is so deeply
 
06:24:49.468 --> 06:24:49.478 align:start position:0%
prejudiced that it's likely that the
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
dismissed okay turning now to uh
 
06:25:00.948 --> 06:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities and one of the one of the
 
06:25:03.628 --> 06:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
crown jewels of our judicial branch has
 
06:25:03.638 --> 06:25:04.830 align:start position:0%
crown jewels of our judicial branch has
been

06:25:04.830 --> 06:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:25:07.510 --> 06:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh our adult drug court and I know many
 
06:25:09.788 --> 06:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
members have been deeply involved in the
 
06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
expansion of the adult adult drug court
 
06:25:15.230 --> 06:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
over the years uh that same concept has
 
06:25:18.750 --> 06:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
been expanded if you will to other areas
 
06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
and um chief justice Harry you want to
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll talk a little bit about um some
 
06:25:26.670 --> 06:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
of those areas my primary focus is on
 
06:25:28.628 --> 06:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
drug court I sat as a drug court judge
 
06:25:30.750 --> 06:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
for a little over eight years I don't
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
sit as often anymore be but I do back up
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
other judges when they're not available
 
06:25:38.230 --> 06:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
um I I want to talk to you about uh the
 
06:25:42.110 --> 06:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
success of that program and the um as a
 
06:25:44.310 --> 06:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
side maybe it could be primary for some
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
but as a side the financial benefit that
 
06:25:49.670 --> 06:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
it produces for the state the cost in
 
06:25:52.430 --> 06:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
Savings in not incarcerating folks and
 
06:25:54.750 --> 06:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
putting them through this program uh
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
when they are successful is astronomical
 
06:26:00.548 --> 06:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
it it costs 10 plus times more to
 
06:26:02.270 --> 06:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerate somebody than it does to
 
06:26:04.590 --> 06:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
have them in a program like this what we
 
06:26:06.670 --> 06:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
look for are folks who are both
 
06:26:09.750 --> 06:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
high-risk that is a risk to recidivate
 
06:26:12.270 --> 06:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
or to commit another crime and they are
 
06:26:14.948 --> 06:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
high need they are severely addicted uh
 
06:26:18.750 --> 06:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
to fentanyl meth or other opiates or
 
06:26:21.030 --> 06:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
stimulants um and are in need of
 
06:26:23.150 --> 06:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
treatment then they come into a very
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
intense supervision and treatment
 
06:26:28.948 --> 06:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
program um we just had our
 
06:26:33.030 --> 06:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
1,000th graduate uh this year and um
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
that represents a 50% little over 50%
 
06:26:39.310 --> 06:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
graduation rate since the start of uh
 
06:26:42.310 --> 06:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
drug courts uh close to 20 years ago in
 
06:26:44.350 --> 06:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
straford County the the legislature
 
06:26:46.990 --> 06:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
created Statewide drug courts in 2016 so
 
06:26:49.990 --> 06:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
that effort is about nine years old now
 
06:26:53.830 --> 06:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
um a 50% graduation rate is phenomenal
 
06:26:56.350 --> 06:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh they've been through uh every phase
 
06:26:58.750 --> 06:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
of treatment every phase of Court
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
supervision um and so many of them uh
 
06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
are leading healthy productive um safe
 
06:27:10.110 --> 06:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh lives and sober uh so I can't say
 
06:27:12.430 --> 06:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
enough about the importance of this
 
06:27:15.750 --> 06:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
program uh to the citizenry um and the
 
06:27:17.830 --> 06:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
court is extremely proud to be a part of
 
06:27:21.750 --> 06:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
it uh mental health courts uh do exist
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
primarily in the circuit courts we've
 
06:27:26.708 --> 06:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
started to um house them in we've
 
06:27:28.510 --> 06:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
started one in belnap county and we're
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to start
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
expanding um this is similar to drug
 
06:27:35.990 --> 06:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
court there may be some um addiction
 
06:27:37.948 --> 06:27:37.958 align:start position:0%
issue but primarily it's a mental health
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
issue that we are attempting to manage
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then change behaviors veterans court
 
06:27:45.430 --> 06:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier was created by
 
06:27:48.270 --> 06:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature to start this year um we
 
06:27:51.150 --> 06:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
do have two veterans courts in Superior
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
Court and I think there are two in
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
circuit um they are essentially informal
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
dockets uh judge St hair manages uh some
 
06:28:02.510 --> 06:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
veterans in Rockingham County and also
 
06:28:04.628 --> 06:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
in marac County with the the assistance
 
06:28:06.430 --> 06:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
of case management through the Veterans
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
Administration and we're trying to
 
06:28:10.910 --> 06:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
expand that Statewide uh and I did
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
mention the young adult um Court pilot
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
program um the other expertise is with
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
circuit on these other
 
06:28:22.270 --> 06:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
courts I'll stand up I'm more
 
06:28:25.110 --> 06:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable as a lawyer actually um let
 
06:28:27.270 --> 06:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
me ask a little about drug court if I
 
06:28:29.548 --> 06:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
might yeah
 
06:28:33.628 --> 06:28:33.638 align:start position:0%
um so what Char does the per is the
 
06:28:35.628 --> 06:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
person who's there always pleading
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
guilty or what's their and they always
 
06:28:40.548 --> 06:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
charge with possession only or what's
 
06:28:43.750 --> 06:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
going on yes and no okay um we are a
 
06:28:46.948 --> 06:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
post plea Post sentenc in court uh so
 
06:28:49.190 --> 06:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
they do plead guilty to an offense it's
 
06:28:51.270 --> 06:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
not always a drug offense in fact more
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
often than not it is not a drug offense
 
06:28:55.990 --> 06:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's some other offense almost entirely
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
driven by their addiction whether it be
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
theft burglaries um we are taking higher
 
06:29:06.390 --> 06:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
risk um defendants now um and
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um the answer is yes you have to
 
06:29:12.948 --> 06:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
plead in and you are sentence but that
 
06:29:15.510 --> 06:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
sentence is suspended and you are placed
 
06:29:17.670 --> 06:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
on probation for a period of three years
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
which is um the period that will likely
 
06:29:22.270 --> 06:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
take to get you through drug court we
 
06:29:24.030 --> 06:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
hope you're done in 18 months but it's
 
06:29:27.030 --> 06:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
usually a little longer than that um
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
does that answer both of your questions
 
06:29:30.948 --> 06:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I had a follow oh and the other one
 
06:29:33.030 --> 06:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
is if you successfully complete you can
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
petition the court to a null your
 
06:29:39.070 --> 06:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
conviction gotcha y when I read the the
 
06:29:42.190 --> 06:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
drug court um law it seemed to me that
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of people in the
 
06:29:47.830 --> 06:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
room paid by who are state employees
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
right there's there's there's a the
 
06:29:53.750 --> 06:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
sheriff there's the uh the doctor
 
06:29:56.070 --> 06:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's the corrections person there's
 
06:29:57.750 --> 06:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
the that's that and the other thing
 
06:30:00.708 --> 06:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
attorney all kinds of other people plus
 
06:30:04.468 --> 06:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
the guy right plus the defendant
 
06:30:06.910 --> 06:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
do you think some of that is overkill I
 
06:30:09.750 --> 06:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know because it just seemed
 
06:30:13.190 --> 06:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
like a lot of right so I I understand um
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
your point and first I want to um make
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
the point that not everybody in the drug
 
06:30:21.468 --> 06:30:21.478 align:start position:0%
court team is a state employee in fact
 
06:30:23.230 --> 06:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
in most of our drug courts they're not
 
06:30:25.510 --> 06:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
we have memorandums of understanding
 
06:30:28.150 --> 06:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
with agencies in Manchester for example
 
06:30:30.708 --> 06:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
the entire program except for the judge
 
06:30:33.030 --> 06:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
probation the prosecutor and the defense
 
06:30:35.110 --> 06:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
attorney all work for the la8 hospital
 
06:30:37.628 --> 06:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
they're on a contract with us similar to
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county straford county is a
 
06:30:41.388 --> 06:30:41.398 align:start position:0%
little bit different there's a a healthy
 
06:30:44.070 --> 06:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
mix of County Employees state employees
 
06:30:45.990 --> 06:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
and private contractors who provide the
 
06:30:48.628 --> 06:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
treatment so it's really a mixed vag on
 
06:30:51.350 --> 06:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
the question of Overkill um one of the
 
06:30:53.548 --> 06:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
things that we are mandated by Statute
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
to do is follow best practices that are
 
06:30:58.150 --> 06:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
set by what used to be known as the
 
06:30:59.708 --> 06:30:59.718 align:start position:0%
National Association of drug court
 
06:31:01.708 --> 06:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
professionals now it's referred to as
 
06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
allrise and the the best practice is to
 
06:31:07.990 --> 06:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
have the judge defense attorney
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor probation officer law
 
06:31:12.190 --> 06:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement representative a case
 
06:31:14.590 --> 06:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
manager and treatment all at the table
 
06:31:16.388 --> 06:31:16.398 align:start position:0%
and if you're fortunate enough to have a
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
housing program they should be at the
 
06:31:21.190 --> 06:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
table too because that's a real key to
 
06:31:23.788 --> 06:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
success thank you representative Bron
 
06:31:27.070 --> 06:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you very much um we
 
06:31:29.350 --> 06:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
heard a bill the other day last week
 
06:31:32.750 --> 06:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would provide a um appropriation to
 
06:31:35.990 --> 06:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
WellPoint um um to support their young
 
06:31:38.350 --> 06:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
adult homeless shelter and I was
 
06:31:40.868 --> 06:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
wondering if in the young adult Court
 
06:31:43.310 --> 06:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Pilot if you've been engaging it all
 
06:31:46.468 --> 06:31:46.478 align:start position:0%
with a wellp point um I I have not I
 
06:31:48.110 --> 06:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't sit in that court that judge
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
Delker who's the supervisory judge um in
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester runs that court that is a
 
06:31:56.110 --> 06:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
question I'll have to provide an answer
 
06:31:57.868 --> 06:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
in writing to you after the hearing and
 
06:32:00.270 --> 06:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
get um a better sense from him of the
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
interaction with wello okay thank you
 
06:32:04.468 --> 06:32:04.478 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:32:05.910 --> 06:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to talk briefly
 
06:32:07.788 --> 06:32:07.798 align:start position:0%
about the family treatment courts in
 
06:32:10.830 --> 06:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court um these courts we started
 
06:32:13.548 --> 06:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
a pilot program in Sullivan County in
 
06:32:17.670 --> 06:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
2021 um and the goal is to increase
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
access of uh parent who is in the abuse
 
06:32:24.388 --> 06:32:24.398 align:start position:0%
and neglect uh who's part of abuse and
 
06:32:27.150 --> 06:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
neglect matter um where one parent has a
 
06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and the approach
 
06:32:33.548 --> 06:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
is uh seen as a best practice where you
 
06:32:36.708 --> 06:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
have a wraparound team approach with um
 
06:32:38.750 --> 06:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholders including the courts
 
06:32:40.468 --> 06:32:40.478 align:start position:0%
including the courta appointed special
 
06:32:44.030 --> 06:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
Advocates Casa DCF parent attorneys
 
06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
treatment providers and then some other
 
06:32:47.990 --> 06:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
community providers and the idea is to
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
engage the parent UPF front with their
 
06:32:53.150 --> 06:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and the reason is
 
06:32:56.510 --> 06:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
is that it gives them a better chance of
 
06:32:58.388 --> 06:32:58.398 align:start position:0%
reunifying with their child if it's
 
06:33:01.110 --> 06:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate because often times these
 
06:33:03.830 --> 06:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
parents are required within a year of an
 
06:33:08.270 --> 06:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicated neglect or abuse to um to
 
06:33:10.190 --> 06:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
correct the conditions that led to the
 
06:33:12.750 --> 06:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
removal of their child with a substance
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
use disorder that's that's a hefty lift
 
06:33:19.948 --> 06:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
and so um what it does is it brings the
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
whole team together with the judge and
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
wraps the services around this
 
06:33:28.110 --> 06:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
individual to give them a better chance
 
06:33:30.628 --> 06:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
of um reaching reunification which is
 
06:33:34.910 --> 06:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
the goal of our um 169c cases um and it
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
decreases generally the time when a
 
06:33:39.948 --> 06:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
child uh is out of the home and
 
06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
decreases the barriers in and time to
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
reunification we expanded in 2024 um in
 
06:33:47.468 --> 06:33:47.478 align:start position:0%
our Manchester Court it's called a
 
06:33:49.110 --> 06:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
supported family approach it's a
 
06:33:51.468 --> 06:33:51.478 align:start position:0%
different category of parents usually
 
06:33:53.670 --> 06:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
with children between birth and three
 
06:33:55.948 --> 06:33:55.958 align:start position:0%
years old um and where the parents are
 
06:33:57.990 --> 06:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
at risk of or are separated from their
 
06:34:00.670 --> 06:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
children where there is one parent um
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
very uh for the record the family
 
06:34:19.230 --> 06:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
treatment court is largely Grant funded
 
06:34:23.070 --> 06:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly mental health uh it is
 
06:34:25.990 --> 06:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
no not news to members of this committee
 
06:34:29.070 --> 06:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
that mental health and
 
06:34:31.990 --> 06:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
curring disorder of substance use is a
 
06:34:34.430 --> 06:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
huge profound public health problem
 
06:34:38.350 --> 06:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
and it affects our Judicial System uh
 
06:34:40.270 --> 06:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
people cycling through our system
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
repeatedly on slide uh
 
06:34:45.548 --> 06:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
27 you will see something called the
 
06:34:47.430 --> 06:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
sequential intercept model this is a
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
model that's been used around the
 
06:34:50.548 --> 06:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
country it divides the criminal justice
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
system into five intercepts what we are
 
06:34:56.310 --> 06:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
doing at no cost to the taxpayer
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
convening uh workshops in each one of
 
06:35:01.150 --> 06:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
our counties bringing together
 
06:35:04.110 --> 06:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to identify opportunities
 
06:35:05.868 --> 06:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
where people who might otherwise be
 
06:35:09.430 --> 06:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
Justice involved are diverted uh out of
 
06:35:13.150 --> 06:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
our system and the object there is to uh
 
06:35:14.590 --> 06:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
increase Public
 
06:35:17.868 --> 06:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
Safety uh save public dollars and most
 
06:35:19.350 --> 06:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
importantly get people the treatment
 
06:35:19.360 --> 06:35:20.070 align:start position:0%
importantly get people the treatment
they

06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:35:23.110 --> 06:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
need um I'm mindful of the time Mr
 
06:35:23.120 --> 06:35:25.030 align:start position:0%
need um I'm mindful of the time Mr
chairman

06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:35:28.708 --> 06:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh I mean we're okay if you are so okay
 
06:35:31.670 --> 06:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we everyone good can we continue
 
06:35:35.948 --> 06:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'll invite judge kisto up on uh
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
Innovation is really really important in
 
06:35:39.510 --> 06:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and we've just
 
06:35:43.910 --> 06:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted a few um areas oh I'm sorry
 
06:35:46.110 --> 06:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
judge Kissinger she going to talk about
 
06:35:48.750 --> 06:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
our landlord tenant uh diversion program
 
06:35:51.230 --> 06:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to keep it quick again um it
 
06:35:54.868 --> 06:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
this is Grant funded um and it began um
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
in November of 2021 and it is a two-step
 
06:36:01.990 --> 06:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
process in our landlord tenant cases um
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
the first is a pre-file ing diversion to
 
06:36:06.910 --> 06:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
mediation if you get an eviction notice
 
06:36:10.270 --> 06:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
um there is uh instructions to um in
 
06:36:13.270 --> 06:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
that notice on how to access um the
 
06:36:17.110 --> 06:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
mediation it is efficient because um for
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
everyone because you there's never a
 
06:36:21.190 --> 06:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant case
 
06:36:24.030 --> 06:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
filed um and it's also
 
06:36:26.150 --> 06:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
dignified um as the landlord and the
 
06:36:29.628 --> 06:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
Tenant works out um a resolution there's
 
06:36:32.110 --> 06:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
also post filing in three courts
 
06:36:34.150 --> 06:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester National and conquered um I
 
06:36:36.788 --> 06:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
presided over one of the first sessions
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
um in with that post uh filing mediation
 
06:36:43.190 --> 06:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
and again um the parties come in
 
06:36:46.750 --> 06:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there are multiple cases and
 
06:36:49.948 --> 06:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
um again it's very efficient because the
 
06:36:52.110 --> 06:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
parties can choose to sit down with the
 
06:36:53.990 --> 06:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
landlord and the Tenant and they have a
 
06:36:58.190 --> 06:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
mediator and they work out um how to um
 
06:37:01.388 --> 06:37:01.398 align:start position:0%
resolve the case it saves time and money
 
06:37:06.150 --> 06:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the landlord and also um gives uh a
 
06:37:09.030 --> 06:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
voice to the tenant and again it's also
 
06:37:11.750 --> 06:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
a more dignified way for people to
 
06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
resolve these very emotionally charged
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
cases um and um so we have uh through
 
06:37:22.230 --> 06:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
May 31 uh it affected
 
06:37:25.868 --> 06:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
1,945 households um there were 70% with
 
06:37:28.948 --> 06:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
agreements um and 41% of the agreements
 
06:37:31.150 --> 06:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh allowed the tenant to stay and this
 
06:37:35.388 --> 06:37:35.398 align:start position:0%
in includes um even those without uh
 
06:37:37.670 --> 06:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
Federal funding for you during the at
 
06:37:40.708 --> 06:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
the end of the pandemic for rent um so
 
06:37:43.510 --> 06:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's a very Innovative and I and
 
06:37:45.468 --> 06:37:45.478 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized actually by the
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
bar assoc American Bar Association um
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
for being effective thank
 
06:37:53.910 --> 06:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
you so in the superior report we have
 
06:37:56.590 --> 06:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
one significant Innovation occurring and
 
06:37:59.310 --> 06:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
that is what we refer to as case s
 
06:38:01.628 --> 06:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
company as Thompson Reuters makes this
 
06:38:04.788 --> 06:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
program this is a digital evidence
 
06:38:07.788 --> 06:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
platform it's a presentation program uh
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
so what we've done is in all of our
 
06:38:13.468 --> 06:38:13.478 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts now in cases that do not
 
06:38:16.468 --> 06:38:16.478 align:start position:0%
involve a jury yet we're working on that
 
06:38:18.430 --> 06:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
um all the evidence that you want to
 
06:38:20.670 --> 06:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
submit documentary photograph and so
 
06:38:22.990 --> 06:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
forth uh is done over this digital
 
06:38:25.548 --> 06:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
evidence platform and it's presented to
 
06:38:27.510 --> 06:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
the judge through the witness and the
 
06:38:30.750 --> 06:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys all digitally uh that mean
 
06:38:32.468 --> 06:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
that makes for a much more efficient
 
06:38:35.388 --> 06:38:35.398 align:start position:0%
management of that record um case Center
 
06:38:38.270 --> 06:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
is our official record um pleased to say
 
06:38:40.030 --> 06:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
that we had one of our first appeals in
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court where the certified
 
06:38:43.628 --> 06:38:43.638 align:start position:0%
record went with the push of a button
 
06:38:45.708 --> 06:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
instead of printing out hundreds of
 
06:38:47.590 --> 06:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
pages of documents and having somebody
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
drive it to the Supreme Court um so we
 
06:38:52.548 --> 06:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
are seeing some real benefits there in
 
06:38:55.468 --> 06:38:55.478 align:start position:0%
terms of Manpower we are moving this um
 
06:38:58.270 --> 06:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
platform and program to jury trials we
 
06:39:00.190 --> 06:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
had our first one in Rockingham County
 
06:39:02.788 --> 06:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
this past fall uh starting to do a few
 
06:39:04.830 --> 06:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
more and and eventually our hope is
 
06:39:06.830 --> 06:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we'll be fully on
 
06:39:13.030 --> 06:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:16.910 --> 06:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
2025 moving to uh slide 31 I'd like to
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
talk about and highlight a uh a joint
 
06:39:23.070 --> 06:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
pilot program with the trial courts both
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
circuit and Superior uh doing text
 
06:39:28.030 --> 06:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
message reminders similar to what you
 
06:39:30.030 --> 06:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
might get uh when you're you know for a
 
06:39:31.868 --> 06:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
doctor or dentist appointment on your
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
cell phone uh it we started this program
 
06:39:37.270 --> 06:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
a little while ago uh in we tested it
 
06:39:41.190 --> 06:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
out in Family Mediation cases uh and
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
increased our uh failure to appear or
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
decreased excuse me our failure to
 
06:39:48.910 --> 06:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
appear rate by 40% which is huge and the
 
06:39:50.510 --> 06:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
reason it we're working on trying to
 
06:39:53.590 --> 06:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
decrease failure to appear rates is that
 
06:39:56.310 --> 06:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
um it takes up so much Court time when a
 
06:39:58.670 --> 06:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
defendant in particular fa fails to
 
06:40:03.468 --> 06:40:03.478 align:start position:0%
appear uh for judge time staff time uh
 
06:40:06.270 --> 06:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutor time uh defense attorney time
 
06:40:09.948 --> 06:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
so it and everything has to get
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
rescheduled sometimes electronic bench
 
06:40:13.388 --> 06:40:13.398 align:start position:0%
warrants go out now we have bail
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
hearings when they're picked up so to
 
06:40:17.590 --> 06:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh failure to appears or
 
06:40:19.868 --> 06:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce them uh We've
 
06:40:22.590 --> 06:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
started this pilot in straford Superior
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
and uh Rochester Criminal Division we
 
06:40:28.388 --> 06:40:28.398 align:start position:0%
don't have numbers yet because it's so
 
06:40:31.150 --> 06:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
new it just started in November uh but
 
06:40:35.388 --> 06:40:35.398 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we have great feedback um on
 
06:40:37.788 --> 06:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
November 5th every defendant uh that
 
06:40:39.388 --> 06:40:39.398 align:start position:0%
appeared in court said that they had
 
06:40:42.270 --> 06:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
received uh the text reminder and one of
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
them said it was the only reason that
 
06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
they were at court that day uh we've
 
06:40:47.910 --> 06:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
been getting great feedback from some of
 
06:40:50.948 --> 06:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
the um def attorneys for defendants as
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
well saying that it helped their client
 
06:40:55.350 --> 06:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
get to court and some of them it was the
 
06:40:57.510 --> 06:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
only reason that they managed to get to
 
06:40:59.750 --> 06:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
court so assuming this is successful
 
06:41:02.830 --> 06:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
we're plan to roll it out uh Statewide
 
06:41:06.388 --> 06:41:06.398 align:start position:0%
in the criminal divisions and then uh in
 
06:41:08.030 --> 06:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
a perfect world we'll roll it out
 
06:41:10.830 --> 06:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
further in areas like small claims where
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
we have huge failure to appear rate in
 
06:41:13.280 --> 06:41:21.430 align:start position:0%
we have huge failure to appear rate in
those

06:41:21.430 --> 06:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:24.030 --> 06:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
cases so Mr chairman we'll move to the
 
06:41:26.350 --> 06:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
third part of our presentation which is
 
06:41:31.788 --> 06:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
our efficiency request page 33 um slide
 
06:41:35.350 --> 06:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
33 uh reminder to uh committee members
 
06:41:36.990 --> 06:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch is a little bit
 
06:41:38.868 --> 06:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
different the way its budget is
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
submitted uh the uh Governor uh can make
 
06:41:47.070 --> 06:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
comments with our budget but as um it's
 
06:41:52.030 --> 06:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a pass through um 34
 
06:41:56.150 --> 06:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
basic facts which kind of uh Define the
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
playing field for our budget one
 
06:42:02.830 --> 06:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel overwhelmingly 75% our cost CA
 
06:42:04.868 --> 06:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
cost are fixed both in terms of salaries
 
06:42:04.878 --> 06:42:05.628 align:start position:0%
cost are fixed both in terms of salaries
and

06:42:05.628 --> 06:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:08.110 --> 06:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and health and dental as I'm
 
06:42:11.030 --> 06:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure the division has heard has gone up
 
06:42:13.150 --> 06:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
significantly uh we have limited control
 
06:42:16.510 --> 06:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
over non-personnel costs uh as mentioned
 
06:42:18.670 --> 06:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
our County Sheriff's great Partners in
 
06:42:21.510 --> 06:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
in security uh they are reimbursed by
 
06:42:23.830 --> 06:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch uh we also make
 
06:42:27.868 --> 06:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
certain transfers to das who actually
 
06:42:30.388 --> 06:42:30.398 align:start position:0%
run our Courthouse manage our our
 
06:42:30.398 --> 06:42:31.468 align:start position:0%
run our Courthouse manage our our
physical

06:42:31.468 --> 06:42:31.478 align:start position:0%
physical
 
06:42:34.388 --> 06:42:34.398 align:start position:0%
locations uh and then we do rent cour
 
06:42:38.310 --> 06:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
houses from third parties and it we are
 
06:42:40.628 --> 06:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
92% generally
 
06:42:44.468 --> 06:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
funded um Governor senuna requested of
 
06:42:46.350 --> 06:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies that they
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
submitted an efficiency budget as the
 
06:42:52.750 --> 06:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
division well knows uh that was 4% below
 
06:42:56.310 --> 06:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal 25 uh adjusted authorized we
 
06:42:58.868 --> 06:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
met that Target in what we submitted to
 
06:43:02.468 --> 06:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
the governor there are some consequences
 
06:43:05.388 --> 06:43:05.398 align:start position:0%
and uh I just want to run through them
 
06:43:08.990 --> 06:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh circuit cour houses in Candia and
 
06:43:12.788 --> 06:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
Claremont will have to be closed um jury
 
06:43:14.948 --> 06:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
trials will be restricted in two months
 
06:43:17.230 --> 06:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court July and
 
06:43:19.868 --> 06:43:19.878 align:start position:0%
December uh we are reducing the number
 
06:43:24.190 --> 06:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
of funded non-judge positions by
 
06:43:29.270 --> 06:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
31.4 uh we have uh we will be ciling uh
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for our pum Courthouse
 
06:43:35.628 --> 06:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
security much of our circuit court
 
06:43:38.070 --> 06:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
security is overwhelmingly provided by
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
per DM officers they are paid on
 
06:43:42.388 --> 06:43:42.398 align:start position:0%
obviously a daily
 
06:43:46.350 --> 06:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
basis um we will reduce the payments to
 
06:43:48.990 --> 06:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
our County Sheriffs we're going to defer
 
06:43:50.830 --> 06:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
the implementation the veterans court
 
06:43:54.110 --> 06:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
we've made no request to fund that and
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh we are curtailing reimbursements uh
 
06:43:59.948 --> 06:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
to our providers in the in the uh adult
 
06:43:59.958 --> 06:44:00.830 align:start position:0%
to our providers in the in the uh adult
drug

06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
drug
 
06:44:03.430 --> 06:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
court the next slide you will see what
 
06:44:05.948 --> 06:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
we've identified as prioritized needs
 
06:44:07.788 --> 06:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
and I think they'll reflect the
 
06:44:12.590 --> 06:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
presentation to to to the moment uh
 
06:44:14.070 --> 06:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr
 
06:44:18.468 --> 06:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
chairman no no problem representa Le
 
06:44:21.030 --> 06:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so it must have been more than
 
06:44:23.868 --> 06:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
15 years ago Senator Odell and I toured
 
06:44:26.270 --> 06:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
the state there was a request to close a
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
number of district courts they were
 
06:44:31.468 --> 06:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
called at the time and Claremont was one
 
06:44:33.628 --> 06:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
of those courts that we said should stay
 
06:44:36.708 --> 06:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
open so I'm curious why Claremont was
 
06:44:39.310 --> 06:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
picked because the outcry of closing
 
06:44:41.868 --> 06:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
Claremont was quite loud at the time I
 
06:44:44.350 --> 06:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
would assume when Claremont hears that
 
06:44:47.468 --> 06:44:47.478 align:start position:0%
the now circuit court is being suggested
 
06:44:50.270 --> 06:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
to be closed that there'll be some push
 
06:44:52.510 --> 06:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
back I think they'll be push back on any
 
06:44:57.190 --> 06:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
Court closure I mean they are as as um
 
06:44:59.310 --> 06:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
judge Christo stated they've evolved in
 
06:45:01.990 --> 06:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a community location in the in
 
06:45:04.468 --> 06:45:04.478 align:start position:0%
the communities that do po uh circuit
 
06:45:08.430 --> 06:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
courts Claremont was chosen I'll let um
 
06:45:11.070 --> 06:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
judge Christo amp uh supplement this but
 
06:45:14.510 --> 06:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
basically it is relatively Co close to
 
06:45:17.708 --> 06:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
Newport and it can be the location in
 
06:45:20.230 --> 06:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
Claremont can be relatively easily
 
06:45:22.270 --> 06:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
accommodated within our footprint in
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
Newport and the second is that the the
 
06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
um physical space in Claremont is
 
06:45:31.548 --> 06:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging it's just um it
 
06:45:34.430 --> 06:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not ideal for a courthouse
 
06:45:36.868 --> 06:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
just put it that way uh further question
 
06:45:39.788 --> 06:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank now is that rented
 
06:45:43.750 --> 06:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
space or is that owned by this it's yeah
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's rented from the City of Claremont
 
06:45:48.788 --> 06:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you thanks Mr chairman
 
06:45:52.270 --> 06:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman um given
 
06:45:55.750 --> 06:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
the concern you expressed about um court
 
06:45:58.590 --> 06:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
security um it it's a little surprising
 
06:46:01.628 --> 06:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
to me that um there would be these these
 
06:46:05.510 --> 06:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
Cuts in um in C Cod uh court security
 
06:46:08.788 --> 06:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
included in your uh in your
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:19.628 --> 06:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:23.910 --> 06:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
ideal prioritize needs um additional
 
06:46:26.868 --> 06:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
resources uh to address the issues that
 
06:46:28.708 --> 06:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh chief justice Howard
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
identified um as he said there's
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
literally someone who Works in
 
06:46:35.788 --> 06:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
electronic filing Center in Manchester
 
06:46:37.430 --> 06:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
who comes in at 5: in the morning to
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
process these cases it's an employee
 
06:46:44.830 --> 06:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're complex and we we ideally would
 
06:46:47.230 --> 06:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
need do need additional resources to
 
06:46:50.590 --> 06:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
process the YDC cases next prioritized
 
06:46:52.990 --> 06:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
needs address what you just raised
 
06:46:55.708 --> 06:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
representative months uh including oh
 
06:46:57.948 --> 06:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no no that's fine I actually
 
06:47:01.750 --> 06:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
this the the on the YDC um amount I was
 
06:47:03.590 --> 06:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask you if you have estimates
 
06:47:06.070 --> 06:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
on how much you're actually expending at
 
06:47:09.388 --> 06:47:09.398 align:start position:0%
this point in processing the YDC claims
 
06:47:11.150 --> 06:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
well it's all been absorbed by existing
 
06:47:13.030 --> 06:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
staff so this
 
06:47:15.750 --> 06:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
represents our estimate of what it would
 
06:47:15.760 --> 06:47:17.230 align:start position:0%
represents our estimate of what it would
need

06:47:17.230 --> 06:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:47:19.788 --> 06:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
minimally to process the cases on a
 
06:47:21.750 --> 06:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis without
 
06:47:24.150 --> 06:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
dislocating what we've had to do
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
existing resources again we do just
 
06:47:28.750 --> 06:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
chief justice Howard will tell you we's
 
06:47:30.590 --> 06:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
got an employee who comes in early in
 
06:47:33.030 --> 06:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the morning to process these cases so
 
06:47:36.110 --> 06:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
this would ask for an additional uh two
 
06:47:39.910 --> 06:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
I believe it's two um Court operation
 
06:47:43.590 --> 06:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
Specialists and one core monitor uh to
 
06:47:45.510 --> 06:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
help process the case that's that's what
 
06:47:53.788 --> 06:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:55.750 --> 06:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
reflects as long as we're stopped I'll
 
06:48:00.070 --> 06:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
ask a question yes uh security per DM
 
06:48:03.708 --> 06:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
um could you hire full-time security and
 
06:48:11.110 --> 06:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.110 --> 06:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
um uh PDM gives
 
06:48:17.110 --> 06:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
us um there costs and benefits to a PDM
 
06:48:20.350 --> 06:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
system um but not having a full-time
 
06:48:22.350 --> 06:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
employee is generally less expensive
 
06:48:24.990 --> 06:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
than having a full-time employee our
 
06:48:27.910 --> 06:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
prospective employee pool are generally
 
06:48:31.150 --> 06:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
not always retired law enforcement and
 
06:48:34.350 --> 06:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it's a better fit for that
 
06:48:36.910 --> 06:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
Community um they don't want to be
 
06:48:39.350 --> 06:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
full-time yes because they lose their
 
06:48:44.190 --> 06:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
pension okay thank you represent sorry I
 
06:48:46.910 --> 06:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
I so just going back a where it says
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
curtailing reimbursement payments to
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
County Sheriffs do you mean you're going
 
06:48:57.230 --> 06:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
to pay them less and they're what is the
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
curtailing actually mean you'll have
 
06:49:02.388 --> 06:49:02.398 align:start position:0%
less security or trying to understand
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
what that we've been in a discussion
 
06:49:06.750 --> 06:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
with the sheriffs about how how we
 
06:49:09.150 --> 06:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
reduce the reimbursement that goes with
 
06:49:11.310 --> 06:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
to them and what that will mean
 
06:49:14.670 --> 06:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
operationally but we we do need to
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the reimbursements and it does
 
06:49:20.510 --> 06:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
more or less mirror our reduction in our
 
06:49:23.750 --> 06:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
court security officer
 
06:49:26.270 --> 06:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
prum reduction on the circuit court side
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
so sort of a negotiation at this point
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay I sort of had thought that might be
 
06:49:41.948 --> 06:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:46.310 --> 06:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
chairman oh thank you um I guess I would
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns that
 
06:49:50.670 --> 06:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ms just mentioned as far
 
06:49:53.670 --> 06:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
as the security issue and I'd be curious
 
06:49:56.910 --> 06:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
um adding to that if you could provide
 
06:49:59.150 --> 06:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that you're proposing
 
06:50:01.628 --> 06:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
to by curtailing the Appropriations per
 
06:50:05.468 --> 06:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
DM if that was restored and also the uh
 
06:50:07.350 --> 06:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
curtailing of reimbursement for the
 
06:50:09.830 --> 06:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
counties because I can see that also
 
06:50:12.948 --> 06:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
becoming a county expense and just a
 
06:50:15.190 --> 06:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
pass down the county sheriff's going to
 
06:50:16.948 --> 06:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
have to pay it and then the County taxes
 
06:50:19.868 --> 06:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
will be impacted so slide 36
 
06:50:23.270 --> 06:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh Turn the Page you'll
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
see it
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
oh oh I'm sorry I didn't turn the page
 
06:50:34.750 --> 06:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so so whoops just so I understand
 
06:50:39.670 --> 06:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
now so because I was trying to figure
 
06:50:42.270 --> 06:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
out how you how you sort of mesh the
 
06:50:44.750 --> 06:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
cuts or the impacts versus your
 
06:50:46.990 --> 06:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs so the idea is that
 
06:50:49.670 --> 06:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
your list of prioritized needs would
 
06:50:52.270 --> 06:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
help to take care of the operational
 
06:50:54.910 --> 06:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
impacts absolutely yes okay so the
 
06:50:57.788 --> 06:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
operational impacts are what
 
06:51:00.430 --> 06:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
are of most concern to us and the
 
06:51:04.708 --> 06:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:07.388 --> 06:51:07.398 align:start position:0%
uh just further on court security one
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
one additional aspect of this is we have
 
06:51:13.230 --> 06:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
a court security officer in our
 
06:51:15.788 --> 06:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
courtrooms while judges are presiding
 
06:51:18.350 --> 06:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
and a reduction in the amount in the
 
06:51:20.030 --> 06:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of court security officers or
 
06:51:22.150 --> 06:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
their perdm availability will
 
06:51:25.110 --> 06:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily reduce that functionality
 
06:51:29.350 --> 06:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:29.360 --> 06:51:30.868 align:start position:0%
 
courtrooms

06:51:30.868 --> 06:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
courtrooms
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
um again uh to representative Eble uh
 
06:51:37.310 --> 06:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
just back on 36 uh the Circuit Court
 
06:51:39.750 --> 06:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
positions those are the positions that
 
06:51:43.430 --> 06:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
we defunded some of them and um it is
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
definitely a priority this legislature
 
06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
had a special committee on the Family
 
06:51:51.388 --> 06:51:51.398 align:start position:0%
Division last year and one of its among
 
06:51:53.788 --> 06:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
its recommendations were to provide
 
06:51:55.628 --> 06:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
additional support to the Circuit Court
 
06:51:57.990 --> 06:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
Family Division including staff
 
06:52:01.948 --> 06:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys and um primarily staff
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys and law clerks and and that is
 
06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
that is in part what's embedded in that
 
06:52:09.230 --> 06:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
number on on slide
 
06:52:13.070 --> 06:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
36 interpretor costs have uh continued
 
06:52:15.948 --> 06:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
to increase given um our increasingly
 
06:52:20.230 --> 06:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
diverse State and um it's just a need
 
06:52:23.350 --> 06:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
and uh something that we need to provide
 
06:52:26.310 --> 06:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
um and that is another prioritized need
 
06:52:28.190 --> 06:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize this is not the
 
06:52:30.270 --> 06:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
entire list of prioritized needs but it
 
06:52:33.670 --> 06:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
does reflect our priorities
 
06:52:33.680 --> 06:52:35.070 align:start position:0%
does reflect our priorities
uh

06:52:35.070 --> 06:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:52:39.070 --> 06:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
slides uh the next three slides wa wait
 
06:52:42.750 --> 06:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
wait represented Wy no again I'm I'm
 
06:52:45.948 --> 06:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
thinking of the filing fees and you got
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
100,000 cases if you went up $10 for
 
06:52:51.150 --> 06:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
every filing fee that's a million dollar
 
06:52:52.830 --> 06:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a possibility that if you went
 
06:52:55.270 --> 06:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
up $20 you got $2 million which would
 
06:52:58.590 --> 06:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
help with some of these costs and i
 
06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
would support it especially if it's been
 
06:53:03.628 --> 06:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
10 years since we went up in fin in fees
 
06:53:04.788 --> 06:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's something that's got
 
06:53:06.750 --> 06:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
to be considered and I know I would and
 
06:53:08.468 --> 06:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
I hope you would thank you no I know
 
06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives came up in ways and
 
06:53:11.830 --> 06:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
means I understand came up with and and
 
06:53:15.788 --> 06:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:15.798 --> 06:53:17.468 align:start position:0%
 
data

06:53:17.468 --> 06:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:53:21.430 --> 06:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
um the next three slides sort of slice
 
06:53:27.110 --> 06:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
and dice are efficiency um budget and a
 
06:53:29.830 --> 06:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
variety of ways slide 37 breaks down by
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
funding source slide 3 8 uh your expense
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:47.910 --> 06:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
slide now to the questions from uh the
 
06:53:50.548 --> 06:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
chair uh question number one new general
 
06:53:50.558 --> 06:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
chair uh question number one new general
fund

06:53:51.910 --> 06:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:53:54.948 --> 06:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
Appropriations over the last five years
 
06:53:58.468 --> 06:53:58.478 align:start position:0%
um there was one which is House Bill 318
 
06:54:01.388 --> 06:54:01.398 align:start position:0%
last year the bail Reform Bill funds
 
06:54:04.388 --> 06:54:04.398 align:start position:0%
were appropriate at ated um but they
 
06:54:07.110 --> 06:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
were not part of the 4% reduction they
 
06:54:09.510 --> 06:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
were sort of set
 
06:54:12.910 --> 06:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
aside question number two from the chair
 
06:54:15.830 --> 06:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh any new positions established and
 
06:54:18.788 --> 06:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
funded over the last five years and the
 
06:54:21.310 --> 06:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
answer appears in the spreadsheet on the
 
06:54:27.628 --> 06:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:27.638 --> 06:54:29.548 align:start position:0%
 
pages

06:54:29.548 --> 06:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
pages
 
06:54:32.628 --> 06:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
so I won't go through them position by
 
06:54:33.990 --> 06:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
position but they're there for the
 
06:54:34.000 --> 06:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
position but they're there for the
committee's

06:54:35.350 --> 06:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
06:54:39.628 --> 06:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
benefit um and then finally arpa funds
 
06:54:42.510 --> 06:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh which were displays by General funds
 
06:54:46.830 --> 06:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
to date it is um the answer appears on
 
06:54:49.270 --> 06:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
slide 41 a case
 
06:54:56.070 --> 06:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
$48,000 so with that Mr chairman that's
 
06:55:01.868 --> 06:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
our presentation obviously welcome any
 
06:55:08.310 --> 06:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:11.948 --> 06:55:11.958 align:start position:0%
questions as as we went along um we'll
 
06:55:15.430 --> 06:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
see any any any more questions so just
 
06:55:18.310 --> 06:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
to sort of tell people um my
 
06:55:20.468 --> 06:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way we he he
 
06:55:23.910 --> 06:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out that um their budget is
 
06:55:26.708 --> 06:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
special in the sense that the governor
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
can say can give us a note but they
 
06:55:32.468 --> 06:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
won't change the number right but I also
 
06:55:34.910 --> 06:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
think it's special in the sense that we
 
06:55:37.350 --> 06:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
basically give them a bottom line single
 
06:55:40.868 --> 06:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
digit you know single number of General
 
06:55:43.788 --> 06:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
funds and how it's spent is is really up
 
06:55:46.830 --> 06:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
to them we're not budgeting even though
 
06:55:48.990 --> 06:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
we got this list of positions we're not
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
really saying okay you know lay off this
 
06:55:54.990 --> 06:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
Court Clerk and this staff attorney and
 
06:55:56.708 --> 06:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
this you know that kind of thing like we
 
06:55:59.548 --> 06:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
do can do with other other divisions so
 
06:56:02.468 --> 06:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
it's it's really um our control is
 
06:56:02.478 --> 06:56:03.548 align:start position:0%
it's it's really um our control is
limited

06:56:03.548 --> 06:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
limited
 
06:56:07.030 --> 06:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
to you know here's the check kind of
 
06:56:09.750 --> 06:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
thing yes representative months so then
 
06:56:15.070 --> 06:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:19.990 --> 06:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
request uh we we uh the interest of
 
06:56:22.270 --> 06:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
transparency the governor did ask us to
 
06:56:24.910 --> 06:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
go back uh we were in communication with
 
06:56:27.510 --> 06:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's office I'll defer to her
 
06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
about um her view of our communication
 
06:56:32.628 --> 06:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
to her
 
06:56:37.548 --> 06:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
and in what's here in the 4% reduction
 
06:56:40.750 --> 06:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
are the magistrates in there or not yes
 
06:56:43.230 --> 06:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
they are yes they are okay so so that
 
06:56:46.830 --> 06:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 318 the bail yes all that
 
06:56:49.430 --> 06:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
stuff okay good all right other
 
06:56:52.190 --> 06:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
questions I want to know this budget
 
06:56:54.628 --> 06:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
sorry this budget does not reflect the
 
06:56:56.310 --> 06:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
revised health and dental rates there's
 
06:56:58.070 --> 06:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
a notation in there I have new numbers
 
06:56:59.548 --> 06:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
but we did we just wanted to match what
 
06:57:02.270 --> 06:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
was submitted on September 16th gotcha
 
06:57:04.548 --> 06:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
okay represent quick I I know it's
 
06:57:07.070 --> 06:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
really late but just because there's so
 
06:57:09.430 --> 06:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
much discussion and focus on the YDC
 
06:57:12.110 --> 06:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
claims when a claim comes in you said
 
06:57:14.830 --> 06:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
you have somebody there processing just
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
really snapshot what is involved in in
 
06:57:22.190 --> 06:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
in processing a claim and then and
 
06:57:23.548 --> 06:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
assuming it's going to go through the
 
06:57:26.910 --> 06:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
mediation process that we've
 
06:57:29.468 --> 06:57:29.478 align:start position:0%
established so we are not involved as
 
06:57:30.948 --> 06:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
the court system in the settlement
 
06:57:34.430 --> 06:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
claims it's housed in AOC yes right but
 
06:57:36.590 --> 06:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a Judicial function it's an
 
06:57:38.510 --> 06:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrative function with the uh with
 
06:57:41.430 --> 06:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
that claims process uh judge brck and
 
06:57:43.750 --> 06:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
judge Nicolosi who are the administrator
 
06:57:45.670 --> 06:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
and assistant administrator they've set
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
out the rules for that what when I'm
 
06:57:50.468 --> 06:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
referring to is our electronic filing
 
06:57:52.948 --> 06:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
Center when a new suit is filed a
 
06:57:55.830 --> 06:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in Superior Court is filed
 
06:57:58.030 --> 06:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
there's the initial suit that's filed
 
06:58:02.830 --> 06:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
and then and the paperwork on that is um
 
06:58:05.150 --> 06:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
astronomical every case that's filed has
 
06:58:07.708 --> 06:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pages of pleadings to it the
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
initially to start the case and then
 
06:58:12.510 --> 06:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
every filing that occurs on that case
 
06:58:14.510 --> 06:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
every motion that's filed every pleading
 
06:58:16.030 --> 06:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
that's filed has to run through our
 
06:58:18.350 --> 06:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
electronic filing Center and then off to
 
06:58:22.230 --> 06:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
our local Court um so that one employee
 
06:58:25.708 --> 06:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
is managing in excess of 1300 cases each
 
06:58:28.868 --> 06:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
one of which would have dozens if not
 
06:58:30.948 --> 06:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of filings the me in case alone
 
06:58:38.660 --> 06:58:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:38.670 --> 06:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

06:58:43.750 --> 06:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:46.468 --> 06:58:46.478 align:start position:0%
manage we just when the legislature set
 
06:58:49.510 --> 06:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
up the claims process it created a
 
06:58:51.948 --> 06:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
choice you could either do the claims
 
06:58:54.948 --> 06:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
process or you could pursue a lawsuit in
 
06:58:57.310 --> 06:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
in one of our courts so that's the
 
06:59:00.830 --> 06:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
choice that the claimants face and at
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
least 1300
 
06:59:05.948 --> 06:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
to date have filed in Superior Court as
 
06:59:09.230 --> 06:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the it some have filed over
 
06:59:12.190 --> 06:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
here they're in both places but those
 
06:59:14.110 --> 06:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
who have filed over here haven't
 
06:59:16.990 --> 06:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily dismissed their cases yet I
 
06:59:20.110 --> 06:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
see I the other thing I will tell uh the
 
06:59:24.468 --> 06:59:24.478 align:start position:0%
division is these cases are extremely
 
06:59:28.190 --> 06:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
complex multiple motions there are there
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
really complex legal issues in each one
 
06:59:32.868 --> 06:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
of these cases
 
06:59:36.270 --> 06:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
and they just get more complex given the
 
06:59:37.990 --> 06:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
number of third parties involved as
 
06:59:39.788 --> 06:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
chief justice Howard said they're
 
06:59:43.510 --> 06:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
contractors involved who who contracted
 
06:59:44.830 --> 06:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
with the state to provide certain
 
06:59:48.430 --> 06:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
services so that that increases the
 
06:59:52.150 --> 06:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
complexity uh and and that complexity
 
06:59:54.110 --> 06:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately lands on the judge and the
 
06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
court staff the superior court and and
 
07:00:02.310 --> 07:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
the um 438,000 per year addition you
 
07:00:04.270 --> 07:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
were requesting for
 
07:00:06.830 --> 07:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
processing is that your estimate of how
 
07:00:09.070 --> 07:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
much has had to be absorbed by your
 
07:00:12.310 --> 07:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
staff or do you think it's an under
 
07:00:15.230 --> 07:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
under um I think it's fair to say that
 
07:00:17.310 --> 07:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
that's what the work of our existing
 
07:00:19.510 --> 07:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
staff is doing the work of maybe four
 
07:00:22.468 --> 07:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
more people that we need right
 
07:00:24.948 --> 07:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
representative wer then representative
 
07:00:28.110 --> 07:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
Griff thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
Chief um when I looked at this whyd youc
 
07:00:34.230 --> 07:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a Feeding Frenzy for
 
07:00:37.468 --> 07:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
lawyers and it it the the point I made
 
07:00:40.030 --> 07:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
to one of them was you know the average
 
07:00:42.590 --> 07:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
citizen keeps their nose clean works
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
hard to prepare themselves for a career
 
07:00:47.190 --> 07:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
works hard for 40 or 50 years in a
 
07:00:49.190 --> 07:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
career you're lucky if you made $2
 
07:00:51.708 --> 07:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
million in your whole career here's
 
07:00:53.708 --> 07:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
someone that didn't obey the rules still
 
07:00:55.510 --> 07:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't obey the rules and then they
 
07:00:57.948 --> 07:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
come to court and they expect Millions
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
when they've perhaps spent a misspent
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
life I just don't see the Ridiculousness
 
07:01:05.830 --> 07:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we should put a limit on
 
07:01:09.070 --> 07:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
this we put a limit on 75,000 75 million
 
07:01:12.388 --> 07:01:12.398 align:start position:0%
a year rather than the 500 million that
 
07:01:14.948 --> 07:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
was first put forward by the Attorney
 
07:01:16.708 --> 07:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
General I thought we can't break the
 
07:01:18.868 --> 07:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
budget with this Ridiculousness for
 
07:01:21.510 --> 07:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
people who haven't obeyed the rules and
 
07:01:23.350 --> 07:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
acting like oh you're rewarded rewarded
 
07:01:27.150 --> 07:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
for what a misspent life it just doesn't
 
07:01:29.468 --> 07:01:29.478 align:start position:0%
make sense to me that someone who got
 
07:01:31.230 --> 07:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
abused because they abused others and
 
07:01:33.948 --> 07:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
abused themselves V should be rewarded
 
07:01:35.430 --> 07:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
with such and that that's the way it
 
07:01:36.990 --> 07:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
looks and somebody that's on the street
 
07:01:39.868 --> 07:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
says well if I send a IDC I'll just say
 
07:01:41.270 --> 07:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
they be abuse me I'll become a
 
07:01:43.230 --> 07:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
millionaire I mean this is this is the
 
07:01:45.190 --> 07:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
example we're setting so and it it
 
07:01:47.548 --> 07:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
really upsets me that I think maybe we
 
07:01:49.708 --> 07:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
should a limit okay thank you but that's
 
07:01:52.350 --> 07:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
our business I think I know but I think
 
07:01:54.110 --> 07:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
I would go to them for
 
07:01:56.310 --> 07:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
advice all right all right
 
07:01:56.320 --> 07:01:57.708 align:start position:0%
advice all right all right
representative

07:01:57.708 --> 07:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:02:00.750 --> 07:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you I hope this a final
 
07:02:03.230 --> 07:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
question but for those people who are
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
both places are in the claims process
 
07:02:09.270 --> 07:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
and they're in the court if they settle
 
07:02:11.750 --> 07:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the claims process can they still go
 
07:02:14.628 --> 07:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
after a contractor in the court if they
 
07:02:16.510 --> 07:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
settle with a state defendant in the
 
07:02:18.628 --> 07:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
claims process yes they still have
 
07:02:21.030 --> 07:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
claims against contractors and that's
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that if it's against
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
the state only that means if there was
 
07:02:27.468 --> 07:02:27.478 align:start position:0%
abuse and it was proved it happened in a
 
07:02:30.270 --> 07:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
state facility by a state actor if they
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
were also abused in a Contracting
 
07:02:34.708 --> 07:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
facility it's a it's a it's the same
 
07:02:37.070 --> 07:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
case but it's a separate claim so they
 
07:02:40.190 --> 07:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
can still do that it get
 
07:02:43.230 --> 07:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
steeper when you say Contracting is this
 
07:02:46.990 --> 07:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
foster care or is this something yeah so
 
07:02:49.990 --> 07:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of a uh
 
07:02:54.350 --> 07:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
um Mount Prospect is a fairly well-known
 
07:02:57.628 --> 07:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
um youth facilities throughout the state
 
07:02:59.910 --> 07:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
um what they do is contract with um
 
07:03:01.788 --> 07:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to Prov
 
07:03:04.830 --> 07:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
provide uh whether it's foster home
 
07:03:07.590 --> 07:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
child shelters um any number of there
 
07:03:08.910 --> 07:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of different types of
 
07:03:11.310 --> 07:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
services that were provided but yes they
 
07:03:13.868 --> 07:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
are um private companies that contract
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the state to provide these
 
07:03:15.600 --> 07:03:17.948 align:start position:0%
with the state to provide these
child-based

07:03:17.948 --> 07:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
child-based
 
07:03:20.230 --> 07:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
Services when I I say def I say
 
07:03:21.628 --> 07:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
contractors because that's what we
 
07:03:24.430 --> 07:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
devise as a shorthand way of how what to
 
07:03:26.270 --> 07:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
refer to these types of defendants
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
representative Camal thank you Mr chair
 
07:03:30.070 --> 07:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
so are these private companies are you
 
07:03:32.070 --> 07:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
finding that they're starting to claim
 
07:03:34.030 --> 07:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy and getting out of the game
 
07:03:36.628 --> 07:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
before they get sued um I haven't seen
 
07:03:40.070 --> 07:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
that yet um most but not all of them
 
07:03:42.190 --> 07:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
have insurance policies that extend back
 
07:03:44.310 --> 07:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
to that period of time I was told by a
 
07:03:45.788 --> 07:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
couple of the lawyers that not all of
 
07:03:47.510 --> 07:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
them have policies they they are
 
07:03:50.788 --> 07:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
self-insured but many of them do than
 
07:03:53.670 --> 07:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
just representa evil maybe I'll have so
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
I guess though the message coming away
 
07:03:58.670 --> 07:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
from this is that the incredible number
 
07:04:02.110 --> 07:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
of claims from YDC has the effect effect
 
07:04:05.548 --> 07:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
of affecting your um processing of
 
07:04:09.388 --> 07:04:09.398 align:start position:0%
Justice not just for them but for many
 
07:04:11.750 --> 07:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
many others throughout the state because
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's such a backlog so it's going Way
 
07:04:18.030 --> 07:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh the folks that are filing the
 
07:04:20.590 --> 07:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
YDC claims it's affecting going to be
 
07:04:22.150 --> 07:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
the whole court system we're going to be
 
07:04:24.548 --> 07:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
hitting critical mass soon that we're
 
07:04:26.150 --> 07:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to make choices on what
 
07:04:28.310 --> 07:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
cases we can go forward on and if it's
 
07:04:31.388 --> 07:04:31.398 align:start position:0%
going to be 500 plus YDC cases that's
 
07:04:33.788 --> 07:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
going to the last decades quite frankly
 
07:04:36.510 --> 07:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
and no other case is going to get done
 
07:04:38.788 --> 07:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
the as you may have seen from the case
 
07:04:41.830 --> 07:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
last year um that one trial took five
 
07:04:46.948 --> 07:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:49.430 --> 07:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
Venture all right thank you all we we'll
 
07:04:52.788 --> 07:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
see you um a week from today not at 9:00
 
07:04:54.270 --> 07:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
amm I
 
07:04:54.280 --> 07:04:56.430 align:start position:0%
amm I
believe

07:04:56.430 --> 07:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
07:04:59.548 --> 07:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman members of
