00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
provide an overview of the department
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
energy is New Hampshire's newest state
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
agency and was created in the last state
 
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:49.970 align:start position:0%
agency and was created in the last state
budget

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
our statute states that the department
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
is to quote improve the administration
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
of state government by providing unified
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
Direction on policies programs and
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the field of energy and
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
utilities making possible increased
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
efficiency and economies from integrated
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
Administration and operation of the
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
various energy and utility related
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
functions of the state government end
 
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.290 align:start position:0%
functions of the state government end
quote

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
quote
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
part of the intent of the legislation
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
was to allow the puc to focus on their
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory adjudicative responsibilities
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
and to make clear the separation between
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
the state's regulatory advocacy role and
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the impartial role that the puc plays
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the department of energy has a large and
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
diverse set of responsibilities the
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
creation of the department involved the
 
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the Public Utilities
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
Commission and the dissolution of the
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're joined by our colleagues from our
 
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agencies the
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission the Office
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
of Consumer Advocate and the site
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
each of these agencies is independent of
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
the department we don't direct them to
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
um we simply how are we simply helping
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
perform various back office budgetary
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
and administrative functions
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from them following my
 
00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:05.090 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from them following my
presentation

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy fills a wide
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
variety of roles in the field of energy
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
this diversity of responsibilities is
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
reflected in our mission statement
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
which reads as follows the prosperity
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
and security of New Hampshire and its
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
citizens requiring affordable Innovative
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
reliable and sustainable energy economy
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is committed to
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
achieving that goal and will provide a
 
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:30.740 align:start position:0%
unified direction of energy policies
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
responsible and practical programs
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
principled regulation and skilled
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
representation in energy relating energy
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
related proceedings of New Hampshire's
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
public interest the department of energy
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
will serve the people of New Hampshire
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
in an honest transparent and effective
 
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.569 align:start position:0%
in an honest transparent and effective
manner

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
let me talk just for a moment about some
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
of those responsibilities the department
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
of energy is an automatic party at
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
proceedings before the puc where we fill
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
a record building and advocacy role this
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
is where we get into the setting of the
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
rates that our electric natural gas and
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
water customers pay unlike many others
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
many other of the regulatory activities
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
in state government we are not
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
regulating individuals and small
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
businesses we're regulating large
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
government guaranteed natural monopolies
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
the effects of our regulation involve
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
direct Financial impacts on what every
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
citizen pays for necessary Services the
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
puc is the adjudicative body that makes
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
decisions in rate proceedings and the
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
doe and the Office of Consumer Advocate
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
work hard in those proceedings to build
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
the record and advocate in the interests
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
we administer Assistance programs and
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
other energy related programs let me ask
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
a short question about that so so
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
essentially the puc is like the judge
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
correct in a rate setting situation
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're one side and the utility is the
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
other side yes we're helping to build
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
the record uh in those proceedings yes
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay the the PCS are the adjudicators
 
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.910 align:start position:0%
okay the the PCS are the adjudicators
gotcha

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
so we administer Assistance programs and
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
other energy related programs mostly
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that use federal funds you can see many
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
of the programs that we administer on
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
the handout that we provided for each of
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
you we also provide support to consumers
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
in dealing with utility companies and
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
take in consumer complaints against
 
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
take in consumer complaints against
utilities

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
we have a substantial role in utility
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
safety and enforcement of the state's
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
law rules and regulations
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
we've also been given a strong policy
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
role which includes the creation of the
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
10-year State energy strategy and
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
providing Technical and policy advice to
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
we also play a major role in Regional
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
discussions collaborations and
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the other states in
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
our region
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
as all of New England is part of the
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
same electric grid the decisions of
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
other states can affect New Hampshire
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is statutorily
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
obligated to defend New Hampshire's
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
interests from shifting from the
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
shifting of costs that result from other
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
states policy decisions
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
in putting together our budget proposal
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
our primary goal has been to take
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the creation of the
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to find operational
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and manage through
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
significant challenges in the field of
 
00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:12.889 align:start position:0%
significant challenges in the field of
energy

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
our budget represents 67.5 million
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
dollars in FY 24 and 67.9 million
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
dollars in fy25
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
as a part of our effort to find
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
efficiencies we proposed a budget that
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
decreases 1.4 percent in FY 24 and about
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
one percent in fy25 as compared to the
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
FY 23 adjusted authorized
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's due in large part to the
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
abolishment of seven positions in this
 
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.670 align:start position:0%
abolishment of seven positions in this
budget

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
our budget is about 87 percent Federal
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
in other funds those other funds include
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
Reggie and the renewable energy funds
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
about 12 to 13 percent is utility
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
assessment and six tenths of a percent
 
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
about 80 percent of our funds are passed
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
through grants that represent
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
either Assistance programs or rate payer
 
00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:03.949 align:start position:0%
either Assistance programs or rate payer
rebates

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
rebates
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
um other than these funds we administer
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
and send out uh
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
we're other than these funds that we
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
send out through these programs uh the
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
department is very much uh people
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
focused agency
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
our team is comprised of many very
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
technical highly skilled and in-demand
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
workers lawyers economists analysts
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
Auditors engineers and many others
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
energy is a complex and Niche field with
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
many opportunities in the private sector
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
that pay substantially more than the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
state our team members are here truly as
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
public servants they are people who want
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
to be here and serve the rate payers and
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
consumers of New Hampshire
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud of our team and how
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
they've responded to the significant
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
challenges over these last couple of
 
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
challenges over these last couple of
years

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
and just a moment on those challenges
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
when the department was created there
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of effort to implement
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
the transition which was expected
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
um but still difficult this included the
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
turnover of a great deal of
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge and Technical
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities but it has really
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted the importance of
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
maintaining our Workforce recruiting and
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
retention is a real challenge as I'm
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
sure you've heard from other agencies
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
we've lost several employees to
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
utilities and even to other states
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies just to give you an
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
example of the five hearings examiners
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
their attorneys we have in our
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
Administration division we've lost three
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
in just over a year uh two have gone to
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
utilities and one went to ISO New
 
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
England the grid operator
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the consumer Advocate will be
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
able to tell you a similar story the
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
training of individual staff represents
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
expensive and and time-sensitive
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
Investments uh by the state that that
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
get lost if that employee leaves
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
there are only a few alternatives to
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
retaining our expert Talent we can hire
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
expensive Consultants who do a good job
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
at a price significantly higher
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
in many instances than what an in-house
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
expert would provide
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
or we can let the and if we don't do
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
that we're essentially letting the the
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
regularly regulated utilities
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
um run unchecked so um it's important
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
that that we retain uh experienced and
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
qualified staff
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
outside of those administrative
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
challenges we're also dealing with the
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
cost and energy security challenges
 
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.620 align:start position:0%
that are not just a state problem
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
they're a regional National and global
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are aspects of these crises that
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
we can control and aspects that we can't
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
but but we've endeavored to do our part
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
but this has affected every part of our
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
business from the regulation of
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
utilities to our Assistance programs to
 
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:39.980 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints and hardships
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
finally and this is an opportunity as
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
much as it is a challenge but there's an
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
absolutely staggering amount of federal
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
funding for energy and climate issues
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
that has been passed over the last few
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
years in Congress
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity for funding has
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
come many changes restrictions and
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements that represent
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
significant costs and Staffing
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire is going to be able to
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
take advantage of these funds we will
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
have to be staffed adequately and
 
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.470 align:start position:0%
have to be staffed adequately and
appropriately

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
and just uh to add to that we have
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
requested and it has been approved by
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
fiscal at least two full-time temporary
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
positions uh to help us administer those
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
new federal funds that are coming
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
um commissioner let me stop you for a
 
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.210 align:start position:0%
um commissioner let me stop you for a
moment

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
um representative Griffin has to leave
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
shortly and he was making some body
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
language that I thought he'd make one
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
day and ask a question so
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm finished okay
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think I as you went on I got to
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
answer my question it basically my
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
question was what are you doing to
 
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:43.370 align:start position:0%
question was what are you doing to
retain

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
staff and what can we do to help you
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
retain staff sure
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
um what we've tried to do um I I think
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
as as an administrator is create an
 
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.730 align:start position:0%
as as an administrator is create an
environment

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
um uh where folks are able to uh grow in
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
their career right so we try to take
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
advantage of additional training
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for staff where
 
00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for staff where
possible

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
we've also
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
um to sort of keep up with
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
um what's happening in the private
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
sector we have allowed a limited uh
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
telework arrangement for some employees
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
I I would add that the the raise that
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
the governor has proposed for state
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
employees I feel that that would help
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
with retention so that's just a handful
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
of things that we've been focused on
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you now you said you
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
were you were reducing number of
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
positions a bit are those all vacant
 
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.370 align:start position:0%
positions a bit are those all vacant
positions

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
um they they currently are yes now
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
um on the budget uh I believe the last
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.340 align:start position:0%
it says you have
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
70 positions being reduced to 66.
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
and eight unclassified being reduced to
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
seven yes
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
is that right yes that's correct okay
 
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.210 align:start position:0%
is that right yes that's correct okay
good

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
um now
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:20.450 align:start position:0%
um now
um

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm used to asking questions
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
first but maybe in this role I should
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
we're okay okay all right so
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so let's look at slightly higher on
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
there so so
 
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:36.980 align:start position:0%
um you're adding
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's something in 23 for General
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
funds that wasn't actually used in 22
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's there's a little bit
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
left over what are those things do you
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
know so in in 23
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
um we did use those uh General funds to
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a match to one of our federal
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
programs the state energy program
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
um in particular for
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the position in our office of
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay and that match is going getting
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
smaller is a kind of what's Happening
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
yes all right but there were other those
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
funds were carried over from understand
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
from when we were the the office of
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives so yes over time
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
we'll be using less General funds
 
00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
we'll be using less General funds
now

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.970 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
so you actually spent
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh this 53 million and 22 but but the
 
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:32.900 align:start position:0%
the following numbers are are
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
considerably higher 15 million higher 14
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
or 15. are you planning to getting close
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
to those numbers is is something new
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
happening I'll let Lenny get into the
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
details but um some of that is our
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
vacancies right um as we were created as
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
a department there are new unclassified
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
positions that weren't filled for some
 
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
positions that weren't filled for some
time

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
um and and others but I'll let uh I'll
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
let Lenny get into the weeds one of the
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
major differences that you can see here
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
is the uh the actuals for the federal
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
funds in 2022 compared to what we have
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
audited for 2023. um the reason for that
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
is because we have we had about 35
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of arpa funds
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
which is not in the budget
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
um so and we had to spend those down
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
first before we could spend our normal
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
program year for like um the low-income
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
heating assistance programs things like
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
that so a lot of those those that 35
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
million was spent first and now we're
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
just um and some of those funds were
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
carried forward into FY 23 and we're
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
spending those funds now so although
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's actual expense less than what we
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
budgeted this this is the about the
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
normal amount that we'll be spending in
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
23 of what is budgeted
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
okay and other funds are going down by
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
seven or six or seven something like
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
so like for the uh the um the Reggie the
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
that's one of our our major other funds
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
um that fluctuates from year to year
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
depending on the regional auctions for
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
buying um basically buying pollution
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
um certificates and that flux that's
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
going to fluctuate from year to year
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's a continually appropriated
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund so we can adjust during
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so we may see a lot and as you can
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
see in um in 22 it was 39 million in in
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
23 it's you know we've just budgeted 32
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
million and 33 and um 24. so we kind of
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
try to keep it historical but there's
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
going to be years where that number will
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
fluctuate up and down
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
especially when you can looking at
 
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.409 align:start position:0%
especially when you can looking at
actuals

00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
actuals
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
now is this the money that we return to
 
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
now is this the money that we return to
Consumers

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
yes we rebate those suppose back to the
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
rate payers but it sort of it flows
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
through your Facebook and a portion of
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
that I should add a portion that does go
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
to Energy Efficiency programs but the
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
vast majority
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
is rebated to rate pairs is it like 80
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
20 or something
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
um it's not even more like 90 10 90 10
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
I think we have a bill about that yeah
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.250 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
is there other things in this other
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
category besides Reggie yes there's the
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund which is a little
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
bit less and that's
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
um payments from the utilities for
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
um that's around you can see that in uh
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
if you um page back a few pages that's
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
in accounting unit 1890. those are also
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
other funds and then the assessment that
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
we charge
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
um the regular utilities for the
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
remaining of our payroll and expenses
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's also makes up the other funds all
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
right so you mentioned this utility
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
assessment right what is that so that is
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the amount that we charge the utilities
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
for the work that the department and it
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
also of what OCA and the puc the puc
 
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.549 align:start position:0%
also of what OCA and the puc the puc
does

00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
so is that a little line on your
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
electric bill or is it
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
somehow in the folded into the price it
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
is it is folded into uh into your bill
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
yes okay and I think David it's in the
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
Tariff right
 
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
Tariff right
um

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.370 align:start position:0%
um
specified

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:24.529 align:start position:0%
 
sense

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
so about 33 cents a month for the
 
00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:29.659 align:start position:0%
average residential rate pair I see okay
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
not not a big number
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
so looking at
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
let's talk about these um Grant programs
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
because looking at your page your pie
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
charts here
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
um it looks like 80 percent of what your
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
money it goes to Grants
 
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.549 align:start position:0%
money it goes to Grants
right

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
contract is Grant our grant funded
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.529 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
so what are the what are what are the
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
major programs there so one was rebates
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
to Consumers on Reggie and the other
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
major programs and give us some numbers
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
about so many million for this so I'm
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
sure so we have um uh there are several
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
federally funded programs that we
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
administer number the first one and
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
largest would be
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
um the low-income home energy assistance
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
program LIHEAP we refer to that as fuel
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
assist the fuel assistance program
 
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:31.390 align:start position:0%
assist the fuel assistance program
um

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
on average the federal government grants
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
us uh about between 25 and 30 million
 
00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:38.750 align:start position:0%
us uh about between 25 and 30 million
dollars

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
um per program year for that program
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
um we also have the weatherization
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
assistance program which that Grant on
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
an annual basis is roughly
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
one one and a half million dollars
 
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.169 align:start position:0%
one one and a half million dollars
um

00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
we have the uh the shop Grant and I'm
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
Lenny you'll have to help me with the
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
total on that every year I forget the
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
exact amount of that Grant it's small
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
it's small it's only around um 100 000.
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
right and then we also have
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
um we also receive the pipe from the
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
pipeline hazardous materials safety
 
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.409 align:start position:0%
pipeline hazardous materials safety
administration

00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
um a grant to
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
um uh fund our pipeline safety program
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
um as well as it's about 500 000
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
annually and uh as well as the one call
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
Grant which is Dig Safe and that's
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
considerably smaller a little less than
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
so Dig Safe is all paid by the FED I
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't know yes it's it's Federal yes
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh and there's also 70 so there's
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
less than one person about 30 paid from
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
the actual like the uh the major gas
 
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.430 align:start position:0%
the actual like the uh the major gas
pipelines

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
pipelines
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um we can only we can only charge them
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
the portion for the for the enforcement
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
of those Dig Safe
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
um charges
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
for fifty thousand you have one person
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
right well that's the that's actually
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
the non-gas portion of the devastate
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
program for like water lines and sewage
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
lines and electric lines and stuff but
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of the Dig Safe program is
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
for natural gas I see which is paid by
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
the utility no uh it's paid by the feds
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
mostly about 70 and then 30 is paid by
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
the those actual gas pipelines all right
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
well let's talk about the big item which
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
is low income fuel assistance so my
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
understanding is right now the cost of
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
heating oil is double what it was a year
 
00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:28.730 align:start position:0%
heating oil is double what it was a year
ago

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
right the average price per gallon as of
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
this week I think is four dollars and 45
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
cents per gallon wow for oil in New
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so how does that affect
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
this program is is this like totally run
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
out of money or is it
 
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.810 align:start position:0%
out of money or is it
no

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
um we have been
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
um to give you an example the average
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
benefit for last year's program year 22
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
winter 21 22 is about a thousand dollars
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
per per household that was the average
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
um we we feel that you know last winter
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
we certified around 25 000 households
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide for the program uh we had
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
adequate funding uh we're up this year
 
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
adequate funding uh we're up this year
considerably

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I I expect we'll be closer to 30 000
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
households enrolled and Josh and uh Josh
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
Elliott can can uh back me up on some of
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I I do feel we have adequate funding
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
we were able to carry forward a
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
considerable portion of the grant we
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
received for for last winter for program
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
year 22 plus we received our regular
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
allocation for program year 23 this
 
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.710 align:start position:0%
allocation for program year 23 this
winter

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.370 align:start position:0%
winter
um

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
so we we feel that we do have adequate
 
00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:37.549 align:start position:0%
so we we feel that we do have adequate
funding

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
um we did increase the benefit because
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
of these higher costs
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
um about 20 I believe uh and um we also
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
Congress passed uh late last year in in
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
the federal budget an additional six
 
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
billion dollars for the LIHEAP program
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
so we expect if they use the same
 
00:28:57.539 --> 00:28:59.210 align:start position:0%
so we expect if they use the same
formula

00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
um that will receive an additional 25
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
million very soon for the program so I
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
feel like we do have adequate funding
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
um based on you mean it could double is
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying yes oh okay I
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
see now how does what's the mechanics of
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that program how does somebody apply
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
sure what how do they qualify so the the
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
agency we contract with the five
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies uh they are a
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
sub grantee for the program they do all
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
of the application intake that process
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
so if someone needs to apply for fuel
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
assistance they can go to their local
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
Community Action Agency they can apply
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
the process of of getting that
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
application through is handled by the
 
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.810 align:start position:0%
application through is handled by the
cap

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:40.820 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
and essentially what we do is we
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
reimburse the Caps they invoice Us in
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
the winter during the season on a weekly
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
basis we pay those invoices but they
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
really handle the entire process at the
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
Community Action Agency
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
no I meant
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
what level of income what level system
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
of course right I'm sorry so
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
um the program were allowed
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
um to uh certified households up to 60
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
percent of the state median income
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
yeah representative yes didn't we pass
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
in for folks between 60 and 75
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
um because just hearing back from
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
constituents there seemed to be uh
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
I don't know a halting uh procedure for
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
getting the funds out to the caps for
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
those people in that higher margin so
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I was going to ask
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
you was how that was going sure
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so when the legislature passed that
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
the legislation to enable that program
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
in September of last year we moved as
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
quickly as we possibly could as a
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
department anytime you have to stand up
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
a new program like this that's that's
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
needed immediately that's a challenge
 
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:07.220 align:start position:0%
um we contracted the legislation passed
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
mid-september and signed into law by the
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
governor we contracted with the Caps to
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
administer that new program at I believe
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
the the first executive council meeting
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
in October
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh we had to develop software
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh for that program
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
um for the Caps uh so between September
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and I believe it was the end of
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
December when we paid out some of the
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
first benefits under that program
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
um it's challenging
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
um you have to have an application
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
process you have to protect against
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
potential fraud so we essentially
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
mirrored uh the requirements of LIHEAP
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the application process so
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
they come in they apply as if they're
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
applying for LIHEAP and if they are over
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
income and fall within the guidelines of
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
the new program they would be certified
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
to receive that benefit
 
00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.750 align:start position:0%
to receive that benefit
um

00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
with the increased numbers of
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
applications this winter for LIHEAP and
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
all types of assistance
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
um it has been a challenge for the
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies they're doing
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
their very best they're working through
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
it but there's just a lot of demand
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
or that was just sort of
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
for how long period for the 60 to 75
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
percent the program ends June 30th or I
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
should say the program closes April 30th
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
um but the program ends uh June 30th so
 
00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
anything left over with laps back to the
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
general fund and just one more the
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
electrical benefit that's being
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
administered through the utility
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
companies or does it go through the Caps
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and pull through the through the Caps
 
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
so that's a 200 benefit for every
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
household that qualifies
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and um that is administered by the
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
caps and those payments are made to the
 
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.549 align:start position:0%
caps and those payments are made to the
utilities

00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
there was because they were involved
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative cameras
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of a dollar do would
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
the Caps take uh somebody must pay them
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
to be the middleman so out of every
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
dollar that's funded do they get a
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
percentage of that or are you con you
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
said you contract with them what are
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
they paid
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I could do the math
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
right now we could get that for you um
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
but the federal government allows 10
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
percent uh to be used for admin and um
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
Lenny yep so the uh 10
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
um for the total Grant is used for admin
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
and about 8.5 percent of that is the the
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
Caps we use and then we'll use the rest
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
the rest of it for our own
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
administrative costs we have two
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
full-time employees at the department
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so I heard I saw the they started at
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
60 of State median income
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
and what what do they receive is it
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
based on their usage do they show you a
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
fuel Bill and they get a percent of it
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
or how does it work there's a matrix uh
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
Inc that includes um to determine the
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
benefit the type of fuel that they use
 
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.510 align:start position:0%
benefit the type of fuel that they use
um

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
yeah average heating costs
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
all right so this is this is a uh would
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
you say 25 or 30 million so this is half
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
your agency or something
 
00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.810 align:start position:0%
your agency or something
um

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
what it what is what else is is large
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
ready uh Reggie red large of course
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's primarily a rebate to races just
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
a direct pay right okay
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
um anybody else like to ask
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative evil
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to talk a little bit about
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
red G and the renewable portfolio so I
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm not a
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
energy geek but I hear a lot about
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
wrecks and all those sorts I'm just
 
00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:09.859 align:start position:0%
curious there's continuing interest in
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount that goes to Energy
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs and more and more
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
being paid out to rate payers I just
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could comment on that
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
how it affects your agency your programs
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
and any thoughts you might want to share
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming I I don't know that you
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
take positions on those bills I would
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
guess you don't I mean I no
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a question for policy makers
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's a question for the legislature and
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
the governor on whether they want to
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
make changes
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
um to the renewable portfolio standard
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
you know our sustainable energy division
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
is is funded by those ACP payments
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
related to that program so obviously
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's an impact the agency of changes
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
are made but um really questions around
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh what should be rebated uh what should
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
go to programs I think really is a
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
question for for the legislature
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
are there new federal grants in this
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
area that you know all this latest
 
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:17.660 align:start position:0%
spending on this kind of stuff there are
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
numerous new federal programs or funding
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
opportunities around energy everything
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
from uh Green Banks so finest financing
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
dollars to
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
um rebate programs for Energy Efficiency
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
purchases for customers
 
00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:35.450 align:start position:0%
purchases for customers
um

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh there are dollars for uh grid
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation projects uh so those projects
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
related to transmission
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so there's uh numerous uh new types
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
of funding that's coming in and we're
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
doing our very best to track all of that
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
um you know we have new guidance coming
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
out frequently from the federal
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
government we are prepared again we've
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
we've tried to staff up with full-time
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
temporary positions to help us
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
administer funds that are coming
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's it's considerable tens
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars for New Hampshire
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
and new federal funding
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
do do we who makes the decision to join
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
such a program you know there's a new
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
program for wind or something who makes
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
the decision to
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
to do that so if it's formula funding
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
for instance through existing grants
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we administer the state energy
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
program is a good example
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
um those are formula grants we're going
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
to accept that funding we're going to
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
use it
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and there may be some flexibility for
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
the state and and how we um utilize
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
um for competitive
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities where we'd have to submit
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
an application and a competitive Grant
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
process we have to look at a couple
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
things right
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
um we're going to try to pursue as much
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
of this as we can so that the taxpayers
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire receive those benefits
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
um but there may be funding
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities that from a policy
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.550 align:start position:0%
opportunities that from a policy
perspective

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um don't match with the goals of our
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
state energy strategy
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
um and there may be some that um
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
may not just make sense for our state
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons but but I do
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
want everyone to know that we're going
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
to pursue as much of this funding as we
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
possibly can
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and would be happy to keep everyone
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you very
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
much I want to first thank you both for
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
being here today I'm sort of similar on
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
that same topic of competitive
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
opportunities I believe either last year
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
or the year before the federal
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
government put together funding for
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hubs around the country you had
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned New England being all sort of
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
in there together has there been any
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
conversation with the other New England
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
states about a New England or Northeast
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hub from that project there
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
there has been so the state of New York
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
um has been the lead on a on a regional
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
Northeast Regional hydrogen Hub
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
um we've had conversations with nyserda
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is the energy office in New York
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:07.390 align:start position:0%
about that
um

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
there are some steps we would need to
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
take to officially join and we've been
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
reviewing those
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
um our general counsel has been working
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
with us on that
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh we we've been trying to work
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
regionally on these opportunities
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
um so yes we are interested in that we
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're being
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
helpful and that our region is receiving
 
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
the benefits of of this Federal funding
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
for Innovation and energy
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep you posted on that if you'd
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
like um but we are having those
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
is there any progress on getting more uh
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas into the state and or more
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
so on natural gas
 
00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.089 align:start position:0%
so on natural gas
um

00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you've seen in the news we
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
are constrained uh when it comes to
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
natural gas capacity in the region
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
um very unlikely that we would see
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
increased natural gas capacity over a
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
pipeline and there are a number of
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
 
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.910 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
um

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.290 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
policies in other states that that are
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors to us
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
um but then there's also just challenges
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
around citing new infrastructure and
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's not just one State's challenge
 
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
that's not just one State's challenge
that's

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
every state into England and the
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
Northeast faces those challenges so
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that we would see in the
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
current environment unlikely
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that we would have how about lmg
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
so on LNG
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
um also another Topic in the news uh
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
over the last number of months
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the Everett LNG terminal in Boston
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
um you know currently that facility in
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
the Mystic generating facility that's
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's connected to it District Gas
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
um currently they're under a cost of
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
service agreement a reliability must run
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
agreement with ISO New England because
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
they were uh threatening retirement
 
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.890 align:start position:0%
they were uh threatening retirement
essentially

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and so we've had them under the RMR
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
for this last winter for this current
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
winter and that agreement
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
ends that contract ends the end of May
 
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.329 align:start position:0%
ends that contract ends the end of May
2024.

00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
so as a region the governor has been out
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
front on this we are working with our
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring states on what are the
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
potential Solutions as it relates to LNG
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
storage in the region in particular uh
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
the Everett marine terminal
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
question on natural gas who's What
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
entity is the largest consumer or who
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
absorbs most of that from the pipeline
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
is there so I think in New Hampshire it
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
um the natural gas generators of
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
electricity would be the largest and and
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
then of course you'd have
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
um commercial industrial customers that
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
use gas and then residential in in FMA
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
how is it allocated who determines or
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
how is it determined who gets what
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
because again there's a lot I mean if
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
more was available it would benefit
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
everybody but how is that determined who
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
gets what sure so so the uh the the
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
local distribution companies
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
um The Gas Utilities they have firm
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
contracts for gas
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
um the generators of electricity do not
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
they they buy it in the market right so
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
they don't have firm contracts for that
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
um but that's essentially how
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it's utilized so if I may say if uh
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
what used to be
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
um Sayer look well
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
um what used to be public service in New
 
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.829 align:start position:0%
um what used to be public service in New
Hampshire

00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
um eversourced now
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
um they have a heavy Reliance I suspect
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
on natural gas for their production how
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
do they ensure that they all have ample
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
supply for what they need to do or is
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
there a way that they do that how in
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
other words there's only so much in the
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
pipeline so to speak and everybody's
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
aware of how much is available
 
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.829 align:start position:0%
aware of how much is available
so

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
um say if I was a heavy user that I
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
would make every effort to kind of have
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
a contract for as much of that as
 
00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:41.150 align:start position:0%
a contract for as much of that as
possible

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.050 align:start position:0%
possible
um

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:45.609 --> 00:43:45.619 align:start position:0%
protecting my my resource and I may not
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
how is that handled I mean is it is it
 
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.490 align:start position:0%
how is that handled I mean is it is it
just

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:58.450 --> 00:43:58.460 align:start position:0%
what happens then because again if if
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's contracted for they can't allocate
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
it to the homeowners over in this
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
community that has to go here so what
 
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.010 align:start position:0%
community that has to go here so what
happens

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's not consumed by
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
that person that is our entity that's
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
absorbing a great deal of it so I would
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
just go back to and and hopefully this
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
is the answer you're looking for but but
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
the local distribution companies so
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
Liberty Utilities
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
um Unitil that have uh residential gas
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
customers they're Contracting
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
um those are firm contracts for the gas
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
they need to serve their customers
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
um I would have to to go beyond that I
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
would need one of my gas analysts to get
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
in the Weeds on all of that
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
um but if if you're a residential uh
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
utility customer that uses natural gas
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
um your utility has contracted for that
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh and then for Generation because the
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
utilities no longer own electric
 
00:44:55.319 --> 00:44:56.990 align:start position:0%
utilities no longer own electric
Generation

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
Generation
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
Um you know those generators are
 
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.809 align:start position:0%
Um you know those generators are
purchasing

00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that uh that gas
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh in the marketplace and they don't
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative cameras thank you Mr
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
chair uh as far as energy Innovation
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
funds and looking at you know new types
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
of energy are you doing anything with
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
new nuclear technologies such as molten
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
salt reactors
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
so as a department we've participated I
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
believe there is currently
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
um a a commission a legislative
 
00:45:34.329 --> 00:45:34.339 align:start position:0%
committee commission that was created
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
and we are represented on that
 
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
and we are represented on that
commission

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
um uh as a resource but as a department
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
we're not pursuing
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
um anything specifically related uh to
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
new nuclear
 
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:49.670 align:start position:0%
new nuclear
um

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
we think it's important that it's like
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
any other
um

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
generating resource that uh New
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.349 align:start position:0%
generating resource that uh New
Hampshire

00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh has an all of the above approach
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
right so we would want to encourage
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
exploration of of any new technology
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
um but we don't have plans
 
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.730 align:start position:0%
um but we don't have plans
um

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:11.180 align:start position:0%
as it relates to nuclear
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
you do work on a 10-year uh plan though
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I would imagine something like that
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
would be included it could be yes and
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
and in our current strategy again we um
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
we support uh policy that would be fuel
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
neutral right so that we're not uh
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
advantaging any one uh type of energy
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
over another
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
um so uh it's an all of the above
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
approach and I think we also mentioned
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
in the strategy the importance of uh of
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
Seabrook uh to uh the generating mix in
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
the region so
 
00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:48.770 align:start position:0%
the region so
um

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're always open to suggestions uh from
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
the legislature if you think that there
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
are uh particular areas of that
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
technology that we should uh you think
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:46:59.400 --> 00:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
we should
um

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
do more investigation or provide uh more
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
information to policy makers like
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
yourself we're happy to happy to do that
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
so in general New Hampshire is the
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
fastest growing state in New England I
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
believe in terms of population and so on
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
right and so therefore I would assume
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
that energy demand
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
is rising the fastest here but because
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're part of iso New England and maybe
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
other places are declining dude is the
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
is the kind of total amount of power
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
well um you know the way we're Regional
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
grid right so electricity flows to where
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
to where it's needed right
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know on resource adequacy
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
which I think is what what you're uh
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at here
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we have as the states
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we have granted uh the responsibility
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
for resource adequacy and the planning
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
around that to make sure we have the
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
generation we need in the region to ISO
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
New England
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and it is really uh their
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure uh that the
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
grid has the uh Power that it needs that
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
that our needs are being met I guess
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is you know if we
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
see our population rising at a certain
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
rate that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
our electric generation capability has
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
to go up at the same rate right because
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
because other places may be declining
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore a little bit of their
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
power that they had in the past could
 
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:36.740 align:start position:0%
come our way
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
sure so system planning I think what
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting we may have less of a
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
need regionally over time and that could
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
happen depending on growth but we are
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
only roughly
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
to nine and ten percent of regional load
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
okay so we're a small piece of it all
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
right any more questions for
 
00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
right any more questions for
commissioner

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
our offshore wind if you could I went on
 
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.490 align:start position:0%
our offshore wind if you could I went on
a

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
trip to Block Island to see their uh to
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
see their Terminals and I feel like our
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
region is pretty aggressively going
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
forward trying to develop that and I
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
know we have a commission on it I just
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could share some
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that sure
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
so I believe was in late 2019 uh
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu requested uh that boaum
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of ocean Energy Management
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh create
 
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.829 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh create
um

00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
a task force for the Gulf of Maine an
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
offshore wind task force for the Gulf of
 
00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
offshore wind task force for the Gulf of
Maine

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
um uh that require request was granted
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
and we've been in that process with boem
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
boem determines the lease areas for
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
potential wind projects there's
 
00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:52.190 align:start position:0%
potential wind projects there's
considerable

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
considerable
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
um stakeholder Outreach as part of that
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
process and um you know in our
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
department we have a director of
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
offshore wind an office of offshore wind
 
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.550 align:start position:0%
offshore wind an office of offshore wind
development

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and we have a director in in that
 
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.550 align:start position:0%
um and we have a director in in that
position

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
um so what we're doing currently is
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
working through the Boeing process
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
um listening to stakeholders uh you know
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
as a state we've been promoting the
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for companies involved in
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
the supply chain
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
uh for offshore wind that we are open
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
for business here and um we would like
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
to see those businesses locate in New
 
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
to see those businesses locate in New
Hampshire

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
um other states Massachusetts
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island have
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
procurement so they're they're actively
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
procuring offshore wind resources but
 
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
for us we're at a stage where we're
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
working through the Boeing process
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
um the lease Awards I believe uh will be
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
made in late 24 uh so so next year
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so things are moving forward Maine
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
has uh has received approval for
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
um a pilot project for offshore wind and
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
I believe utilizing uh floating
 
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.270 align:start position:0%
I believe utilizing uh floating
technology

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we're at we're in the
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
process we're carefully looking at uh
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
all of the options
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and and doing our due diligence
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
um as a state
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up so
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
um we have a 10-year uh energy plan and
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming when you're deciding what
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
federal grants to apply for it relates
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
to the goals that are so are you
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
actively pursuing renewable energy
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities through the Federal grant
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
programs I mean you said something about
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
being energy neutral and I haven't read
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
the plan sure sure
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
um we will absolutely take advantage and
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
pursue funding that that makes sense for
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and um you know with a with a fuel
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
neutral all of the above position
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
um I could see us uh absolutely pursuing
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
funding for storage
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
um technology or or anything that would
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
make sense for New Hampshire
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I think we are open to all of those
 
00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:13.329 align:start position:0%
um I think we are open to all of those
opportunities

00:52:13.329 --> 00:52:13.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
I think we should move on to the POC is
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
that who's next it is all right thank
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
you very much commissioner thank you and
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
do our clerks want to switch or
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman uh representative
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Dan goldner a PC chairman
 
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.829 align:start position:0%
I'm Dan goldner a PC chairman
um

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
here today to talk about the piece you
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
have a brief opening statement if you
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
like or yes go ahead yeah
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
so the Public Utilities Commission is
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
vested with General jurisdiction over
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
electric natural gas water and sewer
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
utilities as defined in RSA 3622
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
for issues such as rates quality of
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
service finance accounting and safety
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
with limited jurisdiction over
 
00:53:06.359 --> 00:53:08.089 align:start position:0%
with limited jurisdiction over
Telecommunications

00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's the PC's mission to ensure the
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
customers of regulated utilities receive
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
safe adequate and reliable service at
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
very brief thank you Mr chairman So you
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in the budget and 363 and I noticed
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
on your handout that um you didn't
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
unlike others you did not include fiscal
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
year 2022 actual because maybe there's a
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
giant jump between actual and authorized
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
right a million dollars
 
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.569 align:start position:0%
right a million dollars
okay

00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
50 so what's going on there why why are
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
you authorized a lot more than you seem
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
to be using
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was mainly because of
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
the uh when the when the two
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
um when the two agents or when puc
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
um split split off some split off and
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
became Department of energy and OSI was
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
combined with
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
um that that part that split off that
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
there was some there were some funds
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
that weren't necessarily put in the
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
right buckets and um 23 the um the
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
commission and also the the department
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
of energy went to
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
um the governor and Council to do what
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
we call the reorg which was part of the
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 language when it created Department
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
of energy it gave us the opportunity to
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
go back to Governor Council and kind of
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
move things into the correct buckets I
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
think this is just a result of that
 
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.210 align:start position:0%
think this is just a result of that
um

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
while while the two while the two um
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
agencies were getting their feet
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
um per se there was just um less less
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
spending there was a lot of vacancies
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of the uh the
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
senior advisor positions were created
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
and they were and it took a while for
 
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
you guys to fill and there's one
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
actually still still unfilled so there
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
was a lot of vacancies so there was
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of spending in in FY
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
22 the first year that the new
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
adjudicative Commissioners the puc part
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
and energy was created
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is of the nine
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions only a handful
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
were there in 2022 but now you're more
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
staffed up is that
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah okay
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
all right now it says all of your funds
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
are other funds
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
are you taking some kind of from every
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
case you get a certain fee or how does
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
that work that's part of the assessment
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the utility assessment so the department
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
of energy we're the ones that calculate
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
that assessment based on what is
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
approved in the budget and then um we we
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
send the assessment out to the utilities
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
um quarterly and then they pay us and
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
that Revenue gets collected into the
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
department and then based on the actual
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
expenses for the OCA and the puc we just
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
transfer the revenue over to them for
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
their actual expenses but the puc is 100
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
utility assessment
 
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.730 align:start position:0%
utility assessment
gotcha

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:14.049 --> 00:56:14.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.650 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
tell me more about
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
um specifically so we heard that your
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
your semi-judicial in in nature right
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
people people come to you and and say we
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
want so much per kilowatt hour and
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
somebody else says no
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
um is that the bulk of what you do or is
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
is there is that 50 is that
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that's the bulk of what
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
we do so rate rate cases which are which
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
is what you're referring to and and the
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
follow-on to the to the large rate cases
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
so we'll have sort of interim there'll
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
be steps there'll be vegetation
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
management there'll be storm
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
um issues so we'll have some interim
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
issues as well but they're all related
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
to the rate case and the utilities
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
generally coming in for uh usually more
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
money and not less
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay and how often does a particular
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
utility come to you is it is a rate case
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
a year is it five years is it what is it
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
you know historically
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
um it's been I think the ever Source
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
rate cases might have been 10 years
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
apart something like that long before I
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
became chair but recently the trend is
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
more towards like a three or four year
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
Rhythm on the rate cases and again
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
they're sort of um there's issues that
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
come up in between rare cases that we
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
adjudicate but the the typical rate case
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
I would say is on a what's called a
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
three or four year rhythm
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
I see so so a special storm or something
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
like that could cause a slight increase
 
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:55.940 align:start position:0%
in rates it could yep there's um yes
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
there's a different different issues
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
that come up that they're they're all
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in the rate case so what
 
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
happens is that um that there's often a
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
settlement in the rate case and there's
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
um from the parties that says that you
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
can come in if you're a utility you
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
can't come in for intermediate changes
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh for different reasons
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
um but that's adjudicated in the rate
 
00:58:20.099 --> 00:58:21.950 align:start position:0%
um but that's adjudicated in the rate
case

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
how many different utilities do we have
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
and how does that change over time well
 
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
I should have brought a really good
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
slide I have on that topic but I'll I'll
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
answer the easy part first which is
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's three regulated Electric
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state in HEC is is more
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
or less not regulated by the puc there's
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
two Gas Utilities there's about 10 water
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
utilities and about half a dozen sewer
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
utilities that we regulate
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
we also have some regulation in in the
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
Telecom space which mostly takes place
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
in the form of poll transfers and we're
 
00:59:01.849 --> 00:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
adjudicating a case there there right
 
00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:02.750 align:start position:0%
adjudicating a case there there right
now

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
having to do with eversource so you said
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
that New England the the co-op one is
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
not regulated yeah I would say uh
 
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
lightly regulated by the PC so we don't
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
have direct rate making Authority for
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
the for nhec
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
um we see them on some tangential issues
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
but not we're not direct direct rate
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
Regulators for an Etc I see yeah my town
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
is somehow on the edge of all this so we
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
have all three we have co-op we have
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
ever source and we have Unitil
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
amongst our in our town and there's
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps more coming this notion of
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
community aggregation which was passed
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
by the legislature we've seen a lot of
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
activity in that area we probably have
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
15 or 16 applications for Community
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
aggregation so local aggregation and
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's activity that we see
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
picking up quite a bit so that's yet
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
another Supply option for folks explain
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
that to me so the um the local community
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
so you know Keen for example can can
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
decide to
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
um can decide to purchase their own
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
electricity so instead of it being so
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you're a never Source customer and
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
eversource provides you something called
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
default service today so they they
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
provide you electricity at 20 cents a
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatt a hour or or whatever it is
 
01:00:24.609 --> 01:00:24.619 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
that you have other options already so
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
you can go to a third party you can go
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
to the PC website it's actually the doe
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
website and look for third parties to
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
get perhaps a lower rate and now you can
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
get community aggregation where your
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
local community is purchasing power
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
supplying power into the uh into the
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
grid for those uh those local
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
communities themselves
 
01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
communities themselves
hmm

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
so are they purchasing power
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
from some producer out of state or
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
something like that is that the they
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
can't we don't regulate where they get
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
it from you know electrons uh can go
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
wherever they want but um but often
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
they'll produce it themselves they might
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
have solar rays or some other sort of
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
local power that they're using they can
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
purchase it on the open market just like
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
eversource or Liberty or Unitil can and
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
so it's really a very new thing for New
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the law just just passed
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
and we're just seeing applications now
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
but there are existing Community
 
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.970 align:start position:0%
but there are existing Community
aggregation

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:27.980 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
entities in Massachusetts and if I'm not
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
wrong Connecticut as well
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
very body or a Judiciary body it was I
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
was wondering to what extent uh policy
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
affects the decision making
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
the legal team can help me with the
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
legal vocabulary but quasi-judicial I
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
think is the term that they use if
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
you're an administrative branch agency
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a judicial branch agency
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
so we're we're quasi-judicial in that
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
sense and I'm sorry I missed the second
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
part of your question
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
I wondered to what extent policy affects
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
the decisions that you're you're making
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
um the the interesting thing in all this
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
that commissioner chicoine went through
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
was that in the new organization where
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
the PC is bifurcated from the doe is
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
that policy falls to the doe so that's
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's not something we engage in so
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
what we do is we're the Arbiters
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
so we look at the needs of the utilities
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want utilities to go out of
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
business because if they do then nobody
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
will get electricity gas and water so we
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
we want they need to stay in business
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
and also the needs of the rate payer on
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other side to make sure that they're
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
are your decisions
 
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.730 align:start position:0%
are your decisions
um

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
can they go to the Supreme Court if
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
someone's not happy Etc they can so we
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
have uh the process is that um in uh the
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
we issue a final ruling and um there's
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
an appeals process internal of the PC
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
but after the final ruling uh any party
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
can appeal to the the state supreme
 
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.289 align:start position:0%
can appeal to the the state supreme
court

01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
has that ever happened yes okay yes
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
going back 100 100 plus years uh the the
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
puc has been appealed to the the state
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court I couldn't give you a
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
history of the outcomes but I think
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's a few
 
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.609 align:start position:0%
there's a few
um

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
I can think of a couple that are active
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
in the state supreme court right now
 
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.510 align:start position:0%
in the state supreme court right now
okay

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
electricity or other
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
let me think one is uh what I'm thinking
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
of I believe are both gas is what what
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
occurs me at the moment we don't what
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
hap from a process perspective once it
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
leaves uh the PC and goes into state
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
supreme court it becomes a department of
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
justice issue so they'll bring us in if
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
they have any questions about the the
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
case or the docket or what have you but
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're not uh we're not really involved
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
once it goes to the Supreme Court that's
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
a department of justice issue okay and
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
so of your I assume it's the
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees who are making
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
these judgments yes
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
um or not necessarily I would um I would
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
I would say the judgments are fully uh
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
from the Commissioners the three
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
commissioners okay yeah so you sit like
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
a board and and you vote um that's right
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
yeah another the the senior advisors the
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
positions that uh that you're referring
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
to we are five filled and one open
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
um advises and we uh we have some really
 
01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:53.780 align:start position:0%
really talented folks attorneys
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
economists and so forth that help us
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
understand the issues
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
um but the commission takes ownership of
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the final decision the three
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioners gotcha all right thank you
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
very much any other questions
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
all right shall we go on to the
 
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
morning

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Andrew Diemer
 
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Andrew Diemer
okay

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to present
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
2025 operating budget request from the
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee the mission of
 
01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:50.299 align:start position:0%
the SEC is the review approval
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement of compliance
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
in the planning citing construction and
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
operation of energy facilities in the
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
state ideally our budget is funded
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
through fees paid during the permitting
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
process of new energy facilities this
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism however can prove unreliable
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
as it is tied to the number size and
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
scope of applicants currently there are
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
zero applicants
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
accordingly additional funding is often
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
needed to supplement the enforcement and
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
adjudication component of the
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee's purview
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
with me today is Lenny from Doe
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
together we will endeavor to answer any
 
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%

to to find work right I mean find work
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean what are you doing to
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
well as a state employee hopefully I
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
personally won't be finding work soon
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
but um no I meant
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
having something to do you said there's
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody kept me in yeah well most
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
of my time is spent on the investigation
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
side of complaints against current
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
generation facilities and uh as the only
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
member of the SEC it's
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I think it's enjoyable because I get
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
to learn how other agencies work I
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
always have to appropriate people
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um often not willingly they're told that
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
they have to work with me the site
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee to process any
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
complaint has to appoint a subcommittee
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
of three people
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
the commissioners of multiple agencies
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
are on the SEC but they will usually
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
appoint a designee
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
to replace them so once we have a
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for a docket we will set
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
about the investigative phase which
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
usually includes a site visit usually
 
01:07:47.289 --> 01:07:47.299 align:start position:0%
includes some sort of Investigation
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
in in recent history it's been Dot
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh conducting the investigation and
 
01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.069 align:start position:0%
uh conducting the investigation and
um

01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's all going well it's a
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
long slow process but
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're we're handling the volume of work
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
so essentially your your administrative
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying and that if
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
you if something came up you would
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
gather a board of decision makers to
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
deal with that particular problem that's
 
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.090 align:start position:0%
deal with that particular problem that's
correct

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
sort of run the blocking and tackling
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
any decisions that need to be made are
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
made first by a subcommittee and then
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
usually by the full SEC gotcha
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
all right when was the last time you had
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
a case or somebody wanted to be is this
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
mostly to build something new or not
 
01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:39.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily you would hope but yeah
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
presently no I've been here since uh
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
late June of this year we've had zero
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
applicants for New Generation we have a
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
lot of people uh kind of pump faking me
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
telling me that something's coming down
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the pike and then it hasn't come
 
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
the pike and then it hasn't come
um

01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what was the second party yeah
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
so so when was the last time somebody
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
built something new in in New Hampshire
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
do we know
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
man I'm trying to thank the last I mean
 
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
I I guess when Northern Pass was a big
 
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
deal there was a lot of stuff dealing
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
with your your area all right sure sure
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
but that never turned the last the last
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we actually permitted to
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
build and this would count as a new
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
application was the Seabrook nuclear
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
power plant applied to build a capacitor
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
Bank project on pre-existing land that
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
they owned adjacent to the power plant
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
so that was new
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
energy facility permitting it was just
 
01:09:37.209 --> 01:09:37.219 align:start position:0%
pretty small
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh that was this year
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
being here to take the questions
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
um on that same line so if they existing
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
utility wish to build a new substation
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
for power would that be something that
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
goes through the process that would yes
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then follow up so they build the new
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
facility do you only examine the plan
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
for that facility or if they were
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
putting up new polls do you examine
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
every poll like what's the what's the
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
scope of we would also
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
um have purview of reciting the actual
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
transmission line
 
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
transmission line
so

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything that's at utility
 
01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:28.490 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything that's at utility
scale

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the budget here
 
01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:39.530 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the budget here
360.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
and there's some big jump
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
yes and I don't see where it comes from
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
FY 22 there was no administrator
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so you can see Zero for actual actual
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
spend on the uh the Personnel lines
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
there and then it was for 23 it was
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
budgeted as a vacant position which was
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
budgeted as step one so now in 24 25 the
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
position is filled at something other
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
than step one so that's why you see
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
those those jumps but work was still
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
going on the chairman the chairman of
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the puc acts as the head of the SEC when
 
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
there's when there is no administrator
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
so what is the remuneration line
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
that's basically a word for other
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
expenses but what we pay out of there
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and you can see a little bit of
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
change from from past years we used to
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
pay some of the the work from the other
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
agencies out of there but we've moved
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
some of that those expenses to the
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
actual transfer to other agencies line
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
um class 49 but other things like some
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
some additional board expenses that
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't listed on here are paid
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
out of that line
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
um it's just kind of like a
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous type
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
and transfer to other agencies are you
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
getting new software or something like
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
that nope that's for um mainly for DOT
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
costs um or or any other agency that
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
helps with the um the citing process
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of those expenses removed
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
from the remuneration line to better uh
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
budget and have a little bit more
 
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.950 align:start position:0%
budget and have a little bit more
transparent

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
Cameron thank you Mr chair do you handle
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
complaints from citizens uh that uh for
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
proposed new projects or new new
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
construction and if so do they have to
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
pay any fees to uh to file a complaints
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
no I mean no they do not have to pay
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
fees to file complaints we do handle
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
complaints on new projects what
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
typically happens is we create a docket
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
for a new project and all the
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
information is posted on our website
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so the way that a complaint or a
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
public common as the case may be would
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
come to me is usually they would email
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
it to me it could also be physically
 
01:13:00.659 --> 01:13:01.729 align:start position:0%
it to me it could also be physically
mailed

01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
mailed
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
and then we post that on the website
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
and um depending on the volume
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
we will then email those to the
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
distribution list of all persons
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
interested in getting information so if
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
it was a major project like the Northern
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
Pass project and you were getting you
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
know maybe 50 you know letters or
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
complaints or something in a day then
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
you would probably bundle all 50 of
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
those together and you would send them
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
out and you would say here are the
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
complaints that came in on February 17th
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
or whatever but the way it works now is
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's so few and infrequent that
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
literally anything that comes out that
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
comes to me as a complaint or a comment
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
some are supportive as well
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
um is immediately sent out to the
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
distribution list and posted to the
 
01:13:47.219 --> 01:13:51.530 align:start position:0%
distribution list and posted to the
website

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
um just curious our 5G towers are do you
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
deal with those because I imagine
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complaints coming in on
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
that probably we do not deal with uh
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
solar I'm sorry um cellular
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
so this is agency income is that a
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
transfer from the energy Department
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
no that is the fees itself
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
fees on whom the fees on those that are
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you want to explain that we have a
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
fee uh schedule a fee worksheet that we
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
use and when you apply for a new project
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
there are fees based on um total
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
megawatt of generation the size
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
um there's a formula that takes
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
transmission lines into account just as
 
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
an example
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
there is a medium what I would call
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
probably a medium-sized solar project
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
that is still in the conceptual phase
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
and a medium-sized solar project
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
by my calculations to bring in about
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars in fees up front
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
so it's not a massive amount of money
 
01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
the northern pass on the other hand the
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
fees probably were and I could look them
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
up enormous sure you know based on the
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
physical size of the line and also the
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh generation what about the Seabrook
 
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.169 align:start position:0%
uh generation what about the Seabrook
capacitors

01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
capacitors
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I do not have that
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
but I could certainly get you that
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
information it would have been a lot of
 
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.209 align:start position:0%
information it would have been a lot of
money

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
and the problem that I wanted to add is
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you know from a budgetary
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
perspective is some years you it's feast
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
or famine you know right now it's famine
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
next year we could get a major uh
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
transmission or generation project and
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
we'd all all of a sudden be flush with
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
fees so um and they would lamps to the
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
general fund or do they roll over
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
they're continually appropriated
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing I see all right so it makes
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
his job I understand very fun and
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
interesting imagine representative evil
 
01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to unwind you know you know
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
the different responsibilities now I
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
understand if there's a new site it's
 
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
very clear that you have authorization
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
to engage but aren't there or
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
there are situations where uh utility
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
polls are being replaced that are pretty
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh you know really widening
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the area that they pass through the
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
polls are much taller they cross
 
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.610 align:start position:0%
polls are much taller they cross
easements

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
easements
 
01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.570 align:start position:0%
easements
um

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
I don't so I feel like the there's not
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
much oversight of those unless the
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
utility company comes in and asks you
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
whether it qualifies for some sort of
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't know judgment or or
 
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.970 align:start position:0%
um I don't know judgment or or
assessment

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:32.750 align:start position:0%
assessment
um

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I just wondered if you could talk
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit because in in my
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
area there were several situations like
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
that that came up and um because it
 
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify as a new site I guess
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
there was no real oversight even though
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people were affected so um
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about transmission lines
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
correct really tall ones so
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
um when the initial certificate was
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
issued for the transmission line it gave
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
them parameters of what they were and
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
were not allowed to do so if an upgrade
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
was within the parameters of what the
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
original certificate said they could do
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
they probably would not apply for a
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
um for an upgrade now what happens more
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
often is that
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
when they um are upgrading a facility
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
they will uh file for what they
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
basically they basically want us to
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
declare whether or not it is a sizable
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
addition okay and this is not Apples to
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
Apples but in the in the Seabrook
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
capacitor Bank project for instance you
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
know they were creating something on
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
property that they already had so they
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
the ruling was on whether or not that
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
was a sizable
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
upgrade and the subcommittee determined
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
it was not a sizable enough upgrade to
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
require a new certificate so in the case
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
of a transmission line that was that was
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
being upgraded with really tall poles
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that would most likely require a
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
ruling from the site evaluation
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
committee that it is either not a
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
sizable upgrade or that it is a sizable
 
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:07.460 align:start position:0%
upgrade in which case they would need
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
but it's on the utility to request
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
is it not or do you I mean they have to
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
ask you whether you think it's a sizable
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
upgrade or if they just do it and you're
 
01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:27.140 align:start position:0%
not aware of it then you don't actually
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
over they would have to ask us before
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right I think we want to get to the
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and but will it be interested to know
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
about the Seabrook payment how much it
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
was and when it came in
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere yeah 360. well it starts on
 
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.550 align:start position:0%
somewhere yeah 360. well it starts on
three

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
359 I guess
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
oh no it starts on 350 58.
 
01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.649 align:start position:0%
oh no it starts on 350 58.
foreign

01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh good morning my
 
01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:27.739 align:start position:0%
name is Donald crease that is spelled
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
k-r-e-i-s I am the attorney who has the
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
honor of serving as New Hampshire's
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate the office of the
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is an independent
 
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:41.900 align:start position:0%
state agency whose job pursuant to RSA
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
36328 is to advance the interests of the
 
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
state's residential utility customers
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
wherever those interests are at issue
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
the place where they tend to be the most
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
at issue of course is before the Public
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and so my office is
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
an automatic party to any puc proceeding
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
in which we enter an appearance and we
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
do tend to appear in all of the major
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
ones in respect to that I like to think
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
of us as helping the puc by Statute the
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
puc is tasked with the job of being the
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
Arbiter between the interests of the
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
utility shareholders and the utilities
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
customers and we put a little weight on
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
the scale on the side of the utility
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
customers because the utilities tend to
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
be very well represented and therefore
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
the shareholders interests are very well
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
represented as you've already heard from
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner shacoin we are
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
Department of energy they have a very
 
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
capable business office in particular Mr
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
Routier sitting next to me provides us
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
with lots of help but we are independent
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
of them I do not report to the
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner of energy I do not report
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
to the chairman of the Public Utilities
 
01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
to the chairman of the Public Utilities
Commission

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh there are about 45 uh similarly
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
situated offices in jurisdictions around
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
the country we have a National
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
Association and quite a vibrant network
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
of ratepayer Advocates around the
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
country uh the other important thing
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
is uh we're very active regionally uh in
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
connection with ISO New England and
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
that's a very important part of our work
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
because with the deregulation of the
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
electric industry uh much of most of the
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
important decisions or at least many of
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
them get made at the iso New England
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
level ISO New England has a stakeholder
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and I put the word
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
advisory in air quotes because it's
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
actually very powerful called nippule
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
and my office is a voting member of
 
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
nippule and the reason I'm highlighting
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
that today is that for the first time in
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
my seven years as consumer Advocate I
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
have asked the governor and now I'm
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
asking the general court to fund an
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
additional position on our staff so I
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
would like to grow the office of the
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate from a team of five
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
employees to a team of six employees and
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
what I propose to do is to devote that
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
sixth employee to participating full
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
time in Regional electricity matters if
 
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
you look at the Nepal meeting schedule
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
on their website you'll see that that
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
tends to involve about eight to ten days
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
of meetings a month just to keep up with
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
all of their work and so my counterparts
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
in the region all have at least one
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
person who keeps an eye on Nepal and the
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
iso full time and I think that is
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to do as well our work
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
regionally complements the work of the
 
01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:50.060 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner shacoin is the state's
 
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
Nesco manager Nesco is the New England
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
states committee on electricity that is
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
how the states appear in their
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
capacities as sovereigns at the regional
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
level and we participate as a member of
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
the end user sector meaning we represent
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
customers in the Nepal context and that
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
is an Ever more important part of our
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
work another big part of what we do is
 
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:17.420 align:start position:0%
education and Outreach
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of questions from
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and one of the things that I
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
think is most important about what I do
 
01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:27.739 align:start position:0%
is I help make the puc process
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
accessible to individual customers or
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
groups of customers that want to
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
participate in puc proceedings and I try
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
my best to help them even when I'm
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that what they're going to
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
be arguing for is not something I will
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with and I would like
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
to brag and say that we rolled out the
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
new website of our office on Valentine's
 
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
new website of our office on Valentine's
Day

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
Day
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to check it out because
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
we designed it with those kinds of
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
imperatives in mind you know really
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
providing meaningful help to rate payers
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
who want to engage in that process
 
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
who want to engage in that process
um

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh uh commissioner shacoin talked about
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I think chairman Golder mentioned
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we like every other state
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
agency group Face Staffing challenges
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
there was one wretched night recently
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
when I was literally the only employee
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
of my agency that was a lonely night
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
fortunately the next morning my new
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
legal assistance started but I I had
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
I've had to rebuild my whole agency and
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't finished yet I have filled all
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
but one of my available positions and
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
that is a been probably the most
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
daunting task I have faced over the last
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
year we are entirely funded by utility
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and you've already heard
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
testimony about what the utility
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
assessment is from my perspective it
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
means that we are paid for by rate
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
payers and I am very mindful of the fact
 
01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
that with everything we do we are
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
spending rate payer money and we try our
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
best to deliver value for the ratepayers
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
um I I heard some interesting questions
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
earlier and I would like to offer a one
 
01:25:11.169 --> 01:25:11.179 align:start position:0%
sentence take on some of those questions
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative hatch asked what happens
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
to firm pipeline capacity that isn't
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
needed and the answer is that there is a
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a process called nomination excess
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
capacity is offered back into the market
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
so those who need extra gas can buy it
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
from those who have locked up firm
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
capacity the problem though is that on
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
those really super cold days of the
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
winter there isn't any excess capacity
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that means that because the gas
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
generators don't have firm capacity they
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
have trouble getting fuel and that
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
causes a lot of problems that that is
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
the most pressing problem when it comes
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
to reliability on the new the New
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
England electricity grid
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr chairman you asked about the
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
state as a growing Community relative to
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions and I I think if you
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
look at the data you'll see that even
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
though New Hampshire is growing and has
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
a really healthy economy our electricity
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
consumption has actually been declining
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
and I have a two-word explanation for
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
why that is those two words are Energy
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
Efficiency from my standpoint as
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate the most valuable
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
thing I can can deliver to the
 
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
constituents that my office serves is
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and the answer the
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
reason is really simple negawatts within
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
n are cheaper than megawatts with an M
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I am an extremely outspoken and
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
energetic proponent of our state's
 
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
ratepayer funded Energy Efficiency
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
programs you can find them on the web by
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
just going to
 
01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:44.890 align:start position:0%
just going to
nhsaves.com

01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:44.900 align:start position:0%
nhsaves.com
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
and finally representative Ebel was
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
asking about offshore wind and uh I
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
would say that the Gulf of of Maine is
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Saudi Arabia of offshore wind but
 
01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
from my perspective as the state's rate
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
payer Advocate it always comes down to
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's only one wallet in
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
the room and that wallet belongs to the
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
ratepayer so at least at the beginning
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh offshore wind power is going to be
 
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
relatively expensive and we have to
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
decide whether we're prepared to pay for
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
that as a community of electric
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
customers and of course we are going to
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
need to build some new transmission
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
capacity because the electrons that we
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
generate on those offshore wind turbines
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
aren't going to get to where they need
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be used without some transmission
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
capacity being added to the system
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
well I think that's all I have to say
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
that I thought of and of course I'd be
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
eager to answer any questions at the gym
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that even though we're
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
growing uh because of efficiency the
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
total use of electricity is declining
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
and therefore maybe we don't have to
 
01:27:50.689 --> 01:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
worry so much about Vermont Yankee going
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
offline and some of these other kinds of
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
losses I I actually do think that we
 
01:27:58.090 --> 01:27:58.100 align:start position:0%
need to worry about meeting future
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
demand more demand because I do expect
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
that Trend to reverse and the reason
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
that that trend is going to reverse is
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
that there are a raft of public policies
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
in place that are designed to Electrify
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
our economy rely Less on producing uh
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
heating things from natural gas and
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
other fossil fuels rely more on air
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
source heat pumps and very efficient
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
electric technology and of course it
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
looks like eventually we're all going to
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
be driving electric vehicles so no more
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
gas stations now you're going to plug
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
your car in so that's gonna that's gonna
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
reverse the trend and we are going to
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
meet we're going to need to be producing
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
and delivering more electricity to the
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses of the state for
 
01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.090 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses of the state for
sure

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
does ISO New England have a specific
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
plan that says electric vehicles this
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
therefore electric deals that therefore
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know every year we have to add so
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
much capacity Etc yes it does it's very
 
01:28:54.169 --> 01:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
uh that if ISO New England were here
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
they would tell you that that is one of
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
their most important functions
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
but they don't themselves create
 
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
electricity right all so
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
our is the market is is is our companies
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
building new plans as we go along uh
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
there is new capacity being added to the
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
system it's very challenging because we
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
do confront constraints in terms of our
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
ability to bring more natural gas into
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
our region but there are other
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
technologies that we need to be looking
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
to we need to figure out how to bring
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
more electricity in from Canada so that
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
raises the prospect of something that
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
starts to look a lot like Northern Pass
 
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
there is the offshore wind challenge as
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
we heard about there are also all kinds
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
of opportunities to produce electricity
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
at the local level and we need to be
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
more Vigilant about bringing those to
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
bear on the grid
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
now on your budget I see
 
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
um there's an extra hundred thousand for
 
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.910 align:start position:0%
um there's an extra hundred thousand for
litigation

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh what do you use that for uh
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
so the word litigation I think has a uh
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's a budget word that is sort of
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
imposed on me but when we mean
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
litigation we mean puc proceedings so
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's nobody's suing anybody else it's
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
just the contested administrative
 
01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
proceedings before the puc and you know
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
we think the puc is supposed to behave
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
like a court the the Quasi in
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial means that I think they
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
do have some policy discretion in a way
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
that a judge wouldn't but it does they
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
are formal proceedings with a formerly
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
developed body of evidence and we
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
participate in that very actively
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
but are those funds how is that hiring
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
an attorney or to to be before the POC
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
or what is that no it really involves
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
hiring outside expert witnesses to
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
present a highly technical factual
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
testimony and opinion testimony to the
 
01:30:55.739 --> 01:30:58.310 align:start position:0%
testimony and opinion testimony to the
puc

01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's go the fact that it's
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
going up by uh 40 or whatever it is
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
um no it's more than that it's
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you're expecting a lot more cases or
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
or those Witnesses are being becoming a
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
lot more expensive or what I I think Mr
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
radio can help you here but we've moved
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
some money around out of various
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
categories and tried to centralize all
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
of that uh or almost all of the money we
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
spend on outside Consultants into that
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
litigation budget line so I don't think
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's increasing significantly but I do
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
think that we need to uh we need to be
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
using more in the way of expert witness
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
resources that we hire from outside
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
Consultants so that's a fact
 
01:31:43.739 --> 01:31:46.270 align:start position:0%
Consultants so that's a fact
foreign

01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
um

01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
when you're representing the consumer
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
with the puc or over issues that um
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
um are in their mind unjust or whatever
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
say the decision is still disputed and
 
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
maybe you would agree with that dispute
 
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
do you go with the consumer to a higher
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
court or what happens then
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
um or is it the end of the road so to
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
speak uh I believe that my statute
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
authorizes me to pursue any remedy
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's available and we do when
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
necessary file appeals before the New
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court okay thank you
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
people thank you
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons I was asking
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
whether the puc was judicial or
 
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.510 align:start position:0%
whether the puc was judicial or
quasi-judicial

01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
um was that I had seen that the
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
commission had issued a report on Energy
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs and that felt like a
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
policy position to me and I and
 
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:54.380 align:start position:0%
um I I've just confused about
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
overlapping responsibilities
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
well represented evil I'll say two
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
things about that one I share your
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
confusion and to the chairman of the
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
public utilities committee a commission
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
is sitting right behind me and my job is
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
to win favor with the puc and not
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
antagonize it and so I really would
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
prefer to answer that address that
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
question in pleadings that I expect to
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
so when the commissioner Coyne said that
 
01:33:29.219 --> 01:33:29.870 align:start position:0%
so when the commissioner Coyne said that
um

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
his Department was one side of a PUK POC
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
case do you really mean you or are you
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
yet another person in the room
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh well we are a pre-existing condition
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh in that the office of the consumer
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
Advocate has existed in some form or
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
another since 1978 and I've always
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
thought of us as the principal source of
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
weight on the other side of the scale in
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
order to understand the emerging role of
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy you have to
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
kind of look at the history and see that
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
really the the department of energy is
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory support division is what used
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
to be the staff of the puc so the puc
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
had its own team of analysts and experts
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
and they were they were there to advise
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
the commission and help build the record
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
and my job is to actually Advocate and
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
try to present things that are really
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
from a ratepayer perspective and I think
 
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
those two perspectives are very
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
different so so commissioner shacoin and
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
his team represent essentially the the
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch of state government and
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
I do not I'm a completely independent
 
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
official all I care about is residential
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
rate payers interestingly if you look at
 
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont right next door in
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
Vermont those two functions are under
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
the same agency their Department of
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
Public Service I I think our Paradigm is
 
01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.149 align:start position:0%
Public Service I I think our Paradigm is
better

01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's brand new yeah they the department
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
of energy is brand new only about a year
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
and a half yeah so there's still uh not
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
to speak for the Department of energy
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
but they're they're still uh in their
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
adolescence I guess and they're still
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
sort of figuring out how best to
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
function and it's interesting and fun to
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
watch them develop as an agency and we
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
have a good relationship with them now
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
does your office deal with anything
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
other than electricity yes we're active
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
in all of the industries that the puc
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
regulates so natural gas is of great
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
importance to us uh commissioner goldner
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that there are a
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
couple of natural gas appeals we have
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
actively appeared in one of them and the
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
oral argument was just the other day
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
very interesting issue and water is a
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
very big deal because while we could
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
live without natural gas and electricity
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
water is essential to human life and in
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
those parts of the states where the
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
state where there are water utilities
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
that's very important and and people
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
care about that I've noticed that when
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
there is an active water rate case
 
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's when I get the most phone calls
 
01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:01.490 align:start position:0%
that's when I get the most phone calls
hmm

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you any
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
homework for these guys no okay all
 
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
right so we're gonna move on to
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
the Community Development Finance
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
Authority and maybe we can stand up for
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.500 --> 01:38:08.629 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.179 --> 01:41:30.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
and this toward the middle of the page
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then a little bit onto 164. so the
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
what's interesting so let's why don't
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right and thank you for coming so
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
what's really interesting is your letter
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
says I'm going to be administering 21
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars but what's in the budget
 
01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:16.370 align:start position:0%
million dollars but what's in the budget
is

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:20.300 align:start position:0%
uh 250 000 so
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
and there's no people in it you don't
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
even work for your your group here so so
 
01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me hold on a second
 
01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:39.050 align:start position:0%
excuse me hold on a second
163.

01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
163.
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
yes sorry go ahead
 
01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.590 align:start position:0%
yes sorry go ahead
absolutely

01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
address you and regarding the one line
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
that we do have in the State Treasury
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
Department's budget for fiscal year 24
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
and 25 which is New Hampshire's required
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
match for the administration of the
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
federal program the Community
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
Development block grants which is better
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
known as cdbg and administered by the
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
Community Development Finance Authority
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
so we're a state chartered independent
 
01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:08.300 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization our board is
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
nominated by the executive Council and
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
the governor and approved there for as a
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
state Authority we're among a handful of
 
01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:17.699 align:start position:0%
unique organizations that work in
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
partnership with state and federal
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
entities to deliver a cost-effective
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
program for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to request the continued match
 
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
funding from the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
the request is 260 000 in state fiscal
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
year 24 and 280 000 in state fiscal year
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
2025. this represents the federally
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
required match of State funds towards
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
the program administration of the
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
Community Development block grant
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:46.250 align:start position:0%
Community Development block grant
program

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
this increase from prior budgets request
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
meets the the minimum State match will
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
enable cdfa to best meet the needs of
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire communities cdfa will
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
increase technical assistance and
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
training provided to those leveraging
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
these Federal resources as well as cover
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
other increased costs associated with
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
program Administration the fact the last
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
three years have really Illustrated to
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
us the need for communities to receive
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to understand how
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
to use these Community Development block
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
grants we've also seen and I will
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
illustrate in a few minutes the real
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
importance of the block grants as a
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
foundational investment that allows
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
communities to really consider and
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
Advance really important Community
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
Economic Development goals so this is
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
often the funds that meet those basic
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
human needs in a community and when a
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
community is able to really meet the
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
needs of people they're able then to
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
continue to think about how to make
 
01:44:43.090 --> 01:44:43.100 align:start position:0%
investments in the community
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
revitalizing downtowns really fast
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
during Partnerships that allow Child
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities to be built building
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
housing those things that are
 
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
foundational to Economic Development
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
Across the state
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
for nearly 20 years cdfa has provided
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
the state with an exceptionally cost
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
effective system for administering the
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
cdbg resources the cdbg program is pro
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
is focused on developing vibrant
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
sustainable and Equitable communities by
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
providing decent housing suitable living
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
environments and expanded economic
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities principally for people of
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
we focus on the on administering a
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
program that creates the greatest
 
01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
possible Community Driven at impacts and
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
adapts to the needs of New Hampshire
 
01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.010 align:start position:0%
adapts to the needs of New Hampshire
communities

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
cdfa has awarded more than 180 million
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
dollars in cdbg resources since 2003.
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
these critical resources have been
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
deployed across the state and had have
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
made significant impacts in economic
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
development in the handout that I
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
provided to you there's some of the
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
numbers that that show the impacts that
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
were made just last year on the first
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
page of the longer handout and they show
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we've that in just last year the
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
program assisted nearly 16 000 people
 
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
through Public Services those are things
 
01:46:02.699 --> 01:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
through Public Services those are things
like

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
um access to nutritional food Child Care
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
Facility uh how the household that
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
receives child care facilities in a
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
facility that was supported by cdbg
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
funds invested public in public
 
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
facilities and retained uh or created 76
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
jobs rehabilitated or preserved over 600
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
housing units we were recently speaking
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
on a project that were invested in right
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
now in Salem two projects actually very
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
different projects one is an investment
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
of the block grant programs to actually
 
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:37.139 align:start position:0%
create new affordable housing in Salem
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
and the other investment is actually in
 
01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
an existing Manufacturing Housing
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative that without the investment
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the block grants would be closed down
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
because the electrical conditions the
 
01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
condition of the electrical
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is so poor that it was
 
01:46:54.119 --> 01:46:55.450 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is so poor that it was
really

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:55.460 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
critical to the health and safety of the
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
residents there that that be improved so
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
the block grants were actually able to
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
be leveraged along with utility funds to
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
improve the electric infrastructure
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the park at Friendship Drive
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
so just two examples in one Community
 
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
really different circumstances but where
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
the block grants were leveraged into
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
that Community to make an impactful
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
results for local residents
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
the result resulting support will ensure
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire communities continue
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
to have access to these millions of
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal resources that are
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
meeting the critical needs to economic
 
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
success in our state These funds are
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
really aligned with a number of
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
strategies that the state of New
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has developed and that we are
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
part of advancing including the office
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Business and economic
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
Affairs and their retention and
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
recruitment strategy as well as the
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
Council on housing stability strategic
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
plan for housing
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's cdbg program prioritize
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
investments in areas that support these
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
strategies including the development of
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
affordable housing expansion of
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
affordable quality Child Care Facilities
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
you have an example of that in your
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
handout at the Mid-State Health the
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
Mid-State health is a federally
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Center in Plymouth they
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
had been operating a facility in the
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
basement of a church for around a dozen
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
students and they recognized in their
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
Community through a planning Grant
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually through the block grants that
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a deficit of about
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
300 Slots of child care and so Mid-State
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
Health decided to take advantage of a
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
building that that was vacant purchase
 
01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
that building using the block grants
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
they were actually able to expand that
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
to 60 60 families that Center opened
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
this spring as in and is in operation in
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
addition to the 60 families that have
 
01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
access to child care they also increase
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
the employment so they increased Quality
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
Employment and as a federally qualified
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
Health Center they were able to hire
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
child care workers and ensure that they
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
had benefits and livable wages in their
 
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.450 align:start position:0%
had benefits and livable wages in their
field

01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
cdbg projects in New Hampshire like that
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
the project at Mid-State Health they
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
leveraged millions of dollars of
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
additional investment into our
 
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.530 align:start position:0%
additional investment into our
communities

01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just speak a little bit about the
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
City of Laconia and some work that we've
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
done there I imagine that that many
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
people know about Laconia and um and we
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
highlight Community progress indicators
 
01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:21.659 align:start position:0%
so these are information about every
 
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
community and we use this information to
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
really understand the conditions of
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
what's happening there and to be able to
 
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
assist municipalities and thinking
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
through how they could put together a
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
block Grant application that's where we
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of that technical assistance
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
so Laconia is the most populous
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
municipality in Belknap County as I'm
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure you all know it has the highest
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
rates of snap which are the food stamps
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
as well as the free and reduced price
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
lunch those are two of the indicators
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we collect we collect 13 indicators
 
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
on all 206 230 form municipalities
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
across the state really giving us that
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
snap snapshot and idea of what's
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
happening in communities
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
across Belknap County families spend 27
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
percent more than the Benchmark of 30 of
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
their household income on housing so
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
housing costs in Laconia are really high
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
and more than eight percent don't have
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
health insurance household income is
 
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
statistically lower than the state
 
01:50:18.729 --> 01:50:18.739 align:start position:0%
median income
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
which along with the snap in the school
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
meals enrollment can be a good indicator
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
of how people in Laconia are faring
 
01:50:25.199 --> 01:50:26.450 align:start position:0%
of how people in Laconia are faring
financially

01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
so cdfa uses these indicators and other
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
information to engage municipalities on
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
projects that could be meaningful in
 
01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
their community and over the last decade
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
we've made significant Investments to
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
help this community meet basic human
 
01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.050 align:start position:0%
help this community meet basic human
needs

01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of examples of our investment
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
include the facility improvements at the
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
Boys and Girls Club of Laconia allowing
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
that building to be a former church that
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
was vacated and was empty for a number
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
of years to be
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
um used by the the Boys and Girls Club
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
to provide that service
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
assisting the Lakes Region Mental Health
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
Center in consolidating in its
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
facilities into one central location
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
being able to provide then better
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
services to the residents of the area
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
and also to improve the efficiency of
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
their operation
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
renovating the Cornerstone downtown arts
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
and culture venues like the Colonial
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
Theater and the Belknap Mill although
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
not done with the block grants the
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
engagement with the block grants allows
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
us to then use other community Economic
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
Development tools and to make those
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
investments in the community
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
so it's unfortunate our representative
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
from Laconia is missing today
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you some Financial stuff
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
so I would I would guess that this 200
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
and this 540
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
000 is half of your administrative costs
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
would that be right that's about right
 
01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.430 align:start position:0%
would that be right that's about right
okay

01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.810 align:start position:0%
okay
now

01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
um it says here that in 2022
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you made grants of 19.8 million but
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
on the front of the page it says you
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
expect for two years to make grants of
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
21 million so is the program getting
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
much smaller or is something going on
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
there no no we administer other funds as
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
well so this is a this is a suite of
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
programs that cdfa and administers
 
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
including a state credit program some
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
other Grant and loan programs as well
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
all focused on community Economic
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
Development so the block grants are
 
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
about 10 million dollars of our total 20
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars invested each year
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay so we're only involved in the 10
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
million dollar part yeah and and there's
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
something else going on I see gotcha
 
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.490 align:start position:0%
something else going on I see gotcha
okay

01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Campbell's
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Sweeney thank
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so through your data
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
analysis you seek out communities that
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
may need may need help uh or does it
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
work the other way do communities come
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
to you because they're aware of this
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
department yeah so it's both
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
um the programs are all open and
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
accessible to all municipalities so each
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
municipality in New Hampshire could
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
access as much as 1.5 million dollars a
 
01:53:02.699 --> 01:53:03.890 align:start position:0%
access as much as 1.5 million dollars a
year

01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and communities know about the block
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
grant so when they have a project that
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
really serves low and moderate income
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
people they seek us out we provide them
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and support for
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
working through an application and also
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
being competitive in the competitive
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
Grant programs which are twice a year
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and um you say the communities
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
know about these programs uh in what way
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
how do they know is their advertising or
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
is it just a common thing that all all
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh these communities know yeah so we
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
work on um annual advertising we work
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
with Partners like the New Hampshire
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the center for
 
01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:42.950 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the center for
non-profits

01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and really ensure that all
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
communities have information and access
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
about the program we also gather
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
statistics on who's applied and who
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't applied particularly
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
um if they haven't applied we really do
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
that Outreach to ensure that they know
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
about the program we know Municipal
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
staff have so many things that they're
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
really handling
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
particularly over the last three years
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to provide that
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
Hands-On technical assistance so that
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
they can access the program
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it provides is
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
actually Grant administrative support so
 
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
we work with both private Grant
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
administrators and the regional planning
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
commissions to be sure that communities
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to take the burden of
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
applying and then administering the
 
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
funds on themselves but they have the
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
support of Grant administrators
 
01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.830 align:start position:0%
support of Grant administrators
yep

01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:30.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman are we as a state
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
accessing the maximum amount of grant
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
money available for us are we leaving
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
money on the table under this umbrella
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so with this uh with the
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
recommendation and approval of these
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
funds we would be accessing the entire
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
amount available to the state of New
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a follow-up question you
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
had mentioned using statistics for a
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
community for median household income
 
01:54:50.159 --> 01:54:51.649 align:start position:0%
community for median household income
whatnot

01:54:51.649 --> 01:54:51.659 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
um obviously projects going on in my
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
district in Salem we have wealthy
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and we have low-income
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that kind of skew our
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
average cities like Nashua Manchester
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
are the same position so when you're
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
assisting communities applying for these
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
federal grants what is the language
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
utilized to the federal like don't look
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
at the one towns you know average income
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
or whatnot how are you do you go down to
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood level like census block
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
or what's the what's how do you how do
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
you factor that yeah so we look at
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
community to be wide information and we
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
also look at census information as well
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gets its allocation based
 
01:55:35.590 --> 01:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
on a federal
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
federal allocation formula so it's
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
overarching it's actually for the State
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and its income and and
 
01:55:46.729 --> 01:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
population that determine the amount
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
that the that HUD provides to the state
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for the program but
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
then as we're understanding what the
 
01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
needs are in any given Community we're
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
looking more granular particularly in
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
those larger communities that have
 
01:55:59.890 --> 01:55:59.900 align:start position:0%
really differences amongst
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods or areas
 
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.410 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods or areas
yep

01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
and in the Salem example I think is a
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
really good we're both looking at
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
existing conditions so what's the
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
conditions in a community
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
um that really need improving so is it a
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
public health uh like the mental health
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
center whose facilities aren't adequate
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking to improve existing
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
facilities but then also to be building
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
new as well
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
here so I have a couple of questions so
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
the the amount of the match that's
 
01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
Illustrated here when the block grants
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
are made to the municipalities or
 
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.970 align:start position:0%
are made to the municipalities or
whomever

01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
have you already provided the match or
 
01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
do they have to provide more match money
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
to get a grant or how does that work
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so they do not have any required
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
match so a community could actually
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
apply for the funds and it could be the
 
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
the total amount to cover the cost of
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
the project a community doesn't have to
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
match the administrative cost that's
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
done by the state and then we generate
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
revenue from other activities to
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
complement and the additional
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
administrative needs of the program
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
right and then I had one other question
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm more familiar with the New
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority so they get
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
involved in housing as well so what are
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
those sort of lines of funds some that
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
you have and some that they have yeah
 
01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely so they administer a couple
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
of funds that are also administered by
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Housing and Urban
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
Development including the home program
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
and also the Housing Trust Fund cdfa is
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
actually similar in governance to New
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing but we focus on
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
Community Development so while we do
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
invest in new housing construction we
 
01:57:45.729 --> 01:57:45.739 align:start position:0%
are often the sole funder in things like
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
housing Rehabilitation also Child Care
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer that allows
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
for housing to be built so there's a a
 
01:57:55.199 --> 01:57:56.109 align:start position:0%
for housing to be built so there's a a
different

01:57:56.109 --> 01:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
focus of the block grant funds but we do
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes partner on projects the
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
project in Salem that we had spoken on
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
and used as an example it has
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
significant funds from New Hampshire
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
sure housing and then the block grants
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
well so you mentioned child care now a
 
01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
couple of times and of course that's a
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
big issue in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:58:21.250 --> 01:58:21.260 align:start position:0%
I mean as the grants come in are you
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
prioritizing needs of the state or
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely yep so Child Care is a high
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
priority in our prioritization of
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
applications okay
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
and we do um a process annually of
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
really evaluating the data of the most
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
needs and getting public input and using
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
so in general this is a competitive
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
situation right you get a some number of
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
Grants and you figure out the best X
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
that meets the amount of funds you have
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
yes yes as opposed to
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
you take everybody who qualifies and and
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
divide up the funds so some they might
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
get 60 percent of what they would need
 
01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
or something like that right it's the
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
former so it's a competitive grant
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
program and those that align most with
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
the priorities the state of the projects
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are funded we also provide planning
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
grants so to ensure that projects are
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
ready for the implementation part of the
 
01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
guidance and assistance that the
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
authority provides is to to provide
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
planning grants without which allow a
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
project to be ready for that
 
01:59:28.679 --> 01:59:30.290 align:start position:0%
project to be ready for that
implementation

01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
So when you say Child Care does that
 
01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
mean you're giving grants to private day
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
care centers and things like that or you
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
have to be non-profit
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
and they have to be primarily serving
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
low and modern income households so 51
 
01:59:46.129 --> 01:59:46.139 align:start position:0%
of the households served by the
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
non-profit facility need to be
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
um need to be low in moderate income so
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
they have to already exist they don't
 
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.129 align:start position:0%
they have to already exist they don't
actually

01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:55.139 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
um they don't have to already exist and
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
we have done some new facilities
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
um but they have to be non-profit owned
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
and serving low and moderate income
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
families those are the priority well but
 
02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't know who they're serving
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
until they start serving yeah so we
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
often in that case encourage them to
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
come in for a planning Grant to do a
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
market study because we do want to
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's the families that
 
02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:17.219 align:start position:0%
need the care
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
um that are going to be eventually using
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
the program but we found that
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
considering the information around the
 
02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
care gaps in New Hampshire that that's
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
not ever been a problem
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
really great for these sorts of Grants
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
yeah across our program so we administer
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
the state tax credit program so the
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
Community Development tax credit program
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
which is an allocation of five million
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
dollars of state tax Authority each year
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's provided to similar Community
 
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
Development projects we also
 
02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
competitively apply for grants that the
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
state would otherwise not be able to
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
complete an application for recently a
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
small business administration Grant to
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
support very small businesses which are
 
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
the majority of businesses in New
 
02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
the majority of businesses in New
Hampshire

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:01:13.129 --> 02:01:13.139 align:start position:0%
um and so across all of our programs we
 
02:01:14.209 --> 02:01:14.219 align:start position:0%
probably see about double the
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
applications for the funds then we have
 
02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
funds available
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative hatch thank you Mr
 
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you and thank you for
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
the very good work you do it's um been a
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
real benefit for my area in many many
 
02:01:27.719 --> 02:01:29.089 align:start position:0%
real benefit for my area in many many
cases

02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
um but my question is um the unutilized
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
black grants that often can happen
 
02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.250 align:start position:0%
black grants that often can happen
um

02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
you alluded to it somewhat but how hard
 
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
do you work to uh assure that everybody
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
knows that this is available and what
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
its utilization what it can be utilized
 
02:01:49.199 --> 02:01:50.089 align:start position:0%
its utilization what it can be utilized
for

02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
um because again I've seen more than
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
several times where the funds were
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
unutilized but there was certainly a lot
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
of needs that needed to be met so just
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
how do you address that I guess yeah
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so if any funds are ever
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
unutilized um they're not they don't
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
we've never returned funds to the
 
02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
federal government so we uh
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
re-re-reauthorize them into a new
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
project but we do recognize that there's
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of needed Municipal
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
capacity to carry out these important
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
projects so that's part of what we
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
really look to provide is support to the
 
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
municipality so they can complete the
 
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
application and then meet the federal
 
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
requirements that are necessary to
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing the funds
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
um we have had some challenges during
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
covid with projects but we've actually
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
had no failed project so we've had to
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
provide additional technical assistance
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
really ensuring that they are successful
 
02:02:44.689 --> 02:02:44.699 align:start position:0%
at doing the competitive bid process and
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
finding contractors and completing the
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
work we've had to have a few extensions
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the work can be completed
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
but it's all been done within the time
 
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
frame required of the federal funds and
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
those projects to date have all been
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
successful so it is
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
um we really do look to your point to be
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
sure that particularly communities with
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
very limited staff can access this
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
resource because communities across New
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need it
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:12.050 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need it
mm-hmm

02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming thank you
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.010 --> 03:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
so being a few minutes after one o'clock
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%

03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
and look forward to the Department of
 
03:34:54.889 --> 03:34:54.899 align:start position:0%

sort of publicly thanked them both for
 
03:35:28.250 --> 03:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
all the hard work they've done on the
 
03:35:28.260 --> 03:35:30.590 align:start position:0%
all the hard work they've done on the
budget

03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
the I'm gonna

all the words I'll take you through it
 
03:35:45.290 --> 03:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
in a summarized fashion and
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
um it looks like we have a an hour
 
03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
budget and so feel free to you know stop
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%

but I'll take you through this fairly
 
03:35:53.279 --> 03:35:54.889 align:start position:0%
but I'll take you through this fairly
rapidly

03:35:54.889 --> 03:35:54.899 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
um it's great to be here I think this is
 
03:35:59.450 --> 03:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
my fourth
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
um test testimony budget work session
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
before Division One Finance and and
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
fifth it'll be my fifth um uh budget
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
that I've done since I've been with the
 
03:36:12.170 --> 03:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
state as the commissioner of doit
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the department of Information
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
Technology is a heavily centralized
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
organization uh you know Pro maybe the
 
03:36:22.190 --> 03:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
most in the country and you might ask
 
03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
yourself well why does that matter I'll
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
get into that a little bit later but one
 
03:36:27.650 --> 03:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the things that helps us do is we
 
03:36:29.330 --> 03:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
really do know a lot about what's going
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
on in I.T in the executive branch and it
 
03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
helps us on the coordination and and
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
driving efficiencies and things like
 
03:36:37.849 --> 03:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
that and we'll show you some examples of
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
that as we go forward through the the
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
presentation our responsibilities and
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
Authority are outlined in the RSA 21r
 
03:36:50.210 --> 03:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
there are a couple uh requested changes
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
to that built into this presentation
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
which I'll hit on when we when we get to
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
them moving on to page two
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um also want to point out we do have a
 
03:37:01.490 --> 03:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
strategic plan that's posted publicly
 
03:37:04.610 --> 03:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
online is available and and in fact uh
 
03:37:07.490 --> 03:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
rep able as a member of the information
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
Technology Council helped us with that
 
03:37:12.530 --> 03:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I won't go into any detail but it is
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
available if the link is in the document
 
03:37:17.809 --> 03:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
which we did share with uh with Melissa
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
I believe and and available also if you
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
Google uh New Hampshire doit uh you'll
 
03:37:26.690 --> 03:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
find that right away uh call out the
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
Strategic themes a couple of the uh more
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
important ones that we you know some of
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
the stuff I would call like hygiene of
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
course we want to you know have strong
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with the agencies and all
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
of our constituents and of course
 
03:37:41.330 --> 03:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
performance and effective Resource
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
Management you should expect that of all
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
the organizations in the state and we we
 
03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
take that pretty seriously but in terms
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
of you know key initiatives This Modern
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
digital government and cyber security
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
are pretty big we're spending a lot of
 
03:37:54.889 --> 03:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
Cycles on that and and
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's driving a lot of what we do today
 
03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
moving on to page three
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
without going into the detailed words
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
um covet really changed the way we
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
operated and we haven't changed back and
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple key areas one was we
 
03:38:14.450 --> 03:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
had already our strategic plan had
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
already called for enterprise we used to
 
03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
call it Enterprise partnership now we
 
03:38:20.570 --> 03:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
call it strategic partnership and really
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
what that meant was if there was an
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use the same solution
 
03:38:27.290 --> 03:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
across multiple agencies or even all
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
agencies we should be doing that rather
 
03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
than buying the same thing here and here
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
and here and here and you know not
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
getting economies at scale and
 
03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
potentially running them differently and
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
less effectively so so we had already
 
03:38:40.010 --> 03:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
started that through our previous
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
strategic plan turned out to be really
 
03:38:46.010 --> 03:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
really helpful when covid hit because we
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
had things in place that that really
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
allowed us to turn things around quickly
 
03:38:52.370 --> 03:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
another thing that and so we're going to
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
continue that
 
03:38:55.610 --> 03:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
um going into this biennium and we'll
 
03:38:57.170 --> 03:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
take you through a little more detail on
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
that another thing that it did is it
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
accelerated the pace of everything we do
 
03:39:04.610 --> 03:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
and everybody was saying okay well now
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's time to slow down you know covert
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
is over or whenever we were saying that
 
03:39:09.729 --> 03:39:09.739 align:start position:0%
but we haven't
 
03:39:12.050 --> 03:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
and it's two things one is that we just
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
got used to moving more quickly uh I
 
03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
think our work our teams got accustomed
 
03:39:17.460 --> 03:39:18.889 align:start position:0%
think our work our teams got accustomed
to

03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
um being able to make decisions and
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
Implement more quickly and had
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
confidence in the in themselves to do so
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
so it was really a two-fold thing
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
um you know continue focus on Enterprise
 
03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
partnership and Enterprise Technologies
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
to drive Effectiveness in in the
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government
 
03:39:40.610 --> 03:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
and of course we'd I'd be remiss not to
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
talk about cyber security
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
we uh starting right before covert we we
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
initiated a comprehensive cyber risk
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
assessment for the executive branch and
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
we learned a bunch of things there we
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
found some strengths and weaknesses and
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
we we worked to address those weaknesses
 
03:40:02.469 --> 03:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
and um and so in many ways
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
we came out of uh the other side of
 
03:40:07.190 --> 03:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
covet stronger on the cyber security
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
side but
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
our enemies keep getting smarter and
 
03:40:13.969 --> 03:40:13.979 align:start position:0%
more effective and changing the way they
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
operate so moving on to Paige the next
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
page just to summarize all those those
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
paragraphs you know we have to keep we
 
03:40:24.410 --> 03:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
have to keep adapting we have to keep
 
03:40:24.420 --> 03:40:25.809 align:start position:0%
have to keep adapting we have to keep
investing

03:40:25.809 --> 03:40:25.819 align:start position:0%
investing
 
03:40:29.210 --> 03:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
to stay ahead of all the threats that
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
are out there and that's one of the
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
things that we spend a lot of time on in
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
the we have a cyber security section for
 
03:40:37.610 --> 03:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
each Information Technology council
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
meeting and uh and it's a big focus of
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
ours to make sure that we're transparent
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing and and we're also
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
adapting to what the threat threat
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
landscape is out there so
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
so moving on
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
um to page five at the top
 
03:40:55.739 --> 03:40:57.170 align:start position:0%
um to page five at the top
um

03:40:57.170 --> 03:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
we build this budget over a period of a
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
year or so working collaboratively with
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
our agency partners so the way we're
 
03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
organized is we have we have a division
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
that focuses on agencies and we'll talk
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
more about that as we get into the into
 
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
the presentation but for each agency
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
there's an I.T lead and that I.T lead
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
collaborates with the folks inside the
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
agency to develop their budget and so we
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
at the same time we developed there what
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
is called an aitp an agency Information
 
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
Technology plan and so we use those
 
03:41:35.450 --> 03:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
aitps every every biennial budget cycle
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
to help align with their budgets in
 
03:41:40.010 --> 03:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
other words okay so here's your aitp
 
03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
here's what you say is important from a
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
technology perspective for your agency
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
and here's what your budget says and we
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
hope that the budget aligns with what
 
03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're saying is important to them and
 
03:41:52.010 --> 03:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
try to steer it in that direction so
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a very high level overview
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
of how we how we build the the it budget
 
03:41:58.370 --> 03:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
particularly the age agency direct I.T
 
03:41:58.380 --> 03:41:59.690 align:start position:0%
particularly the age agency direct I.T
budget

03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's some budget Trends
 
03:42:04.130 --> 03:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that the the areas
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the budget have gone up quite a bit
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
and and I thought it would be important
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
to explain what the trends are that
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that are driving some of
 
03:42:15.190 --> 03:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the first and most important is
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
agencies continue to invest that
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
technology density I call it inside the
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
agencies is increasing they're using it
 
03:42:22.680 --> 03:42:24.110 align:start position:0%
agencies is increasing they're using it
more

03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and and they're asking for more in
 
03:42:28.250 --> 03:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
each biennial cycle that we've gone
 
03:42:30.050 --> 03:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
through so and we'll talk some more
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
about that as we get into the the bones
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
of the of the budget proposal
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
but it really is and and there's so
 
03:42:40.010 --> 03:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing that in some cases
 
03:42:42.290 --> 03:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're moving stuff that was in their
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
budget into our budget so like dot did
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
that for the last budget cycle they had
 
03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:48.779 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of I.T stuff that actually
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't in our budget that got moved into
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
our budget so it looked like the spend
 
03:42:54.170 --> 03:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
went up but it really didn't
 
03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh overall
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are also asking for increasing
 
03:42:59.520 --> 03:43:02.330 align:start position:0%
agencies are also asking for increasing
resources

03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.150 --> 03:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm I got to leave very
 
03:43:07.190 --> 03:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
shortly so I'm going to jump to the end
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
and interrupt you
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so your budget ends on page
 
03:43:14.690 --> 03:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
um 56
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's where the big totals are it's
 
03:43:18.410 --> 03:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
very similar to page six of your
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
presentation correct except that
 
03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:22.090 align:start position:0%
presentation correct except that
includes

03:43:22.090 --> 03:43:22.100 align:start position:0%
includes
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
2022 actuals
 
03:43:28.849 --> 03:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
so there's a big jump between uh 2020 to
 
03:43:32.570 --> 03:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
actual and 2023 authorized about almost
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
so are you going to spend more like 2022
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
or more like
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
well we always we always have a
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
significant underspend in the in the um
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits space because we
 
03:43:52.610 --> 03:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're always historically we operated uh
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know around a nine or ten percent
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now we actually have
 
03:43:58.729 --> 03:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh a little over I think it's a little
 
03:44:00.530 --> 03:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
over 12 percent vacancy rate so it's
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually Low by uh the state standards
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
some of our my agency partners have much
 
03:44:07.190 --> 03:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
higher vacancy rates but that that means
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know that that salary and benefit
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
line we're going to understand and and
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
agencies you know we do understand
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
um at the agency level for some of the
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
agencies and and also in our shared as
 
03:44:20.690 --> 03:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
well based on uh particularly if if
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
things are based on PC counts and you
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
know we're billing based on PC accounts
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
and there's less
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um there's actually less less employees
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
than we plan for because we plan for
 
03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:33.469 align:start position:0%
than we plan for because we plan for
authorized

03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
so if there's fewer than authorized then
 
03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
you know we may be could have found any
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah so but a 10 vacancy
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a 10 million dollar thing
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
or even less right this is a 20 million
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
dollar thing right so yeah yeah so we we
 
03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
will We historically do understand what
 
03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
our budget is by a significant
 
03:44:58.370 --> 03:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
significant amount and and so and then
 
03:45:02.090 --> 03:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
you're expecting an an extra 16 million
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
from 23 authorized to 24. maybe some of
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is what you said
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
um D.O.T is adding and some of these
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
kind of things right you know yeah in
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
fact I have that a page for that in this
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
presentation if you'd like to jump to it
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure you get what you
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
need when you take off so um sure yeah
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
let me let me find out what page that is
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
here uh all right uh let's go to page
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
eight if you would
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
in our presentation we'll talk about the
 
03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.150 align:start position:0%
in our presentation we'll talk about the
uh

03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
the the largest
 
03:45:37.729 --> 03:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
chunk of that increases agency Direct
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
agency direct part of the budget is the
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
part that's large almost completely
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
driven by agency business priorities in
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
other words we they tell us what they
 
03:45:49.969 --> 03:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
want we do it and that's not people
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
that's things and you can see kind of a
 
03:45:55.010 --> 03:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
general list of the types of things that
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
are purchased on that and and the ask
 
03:45:59.950 --> 03:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
from the agencies
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
compared to 23 adjusted authorized
 
03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
versus what the ask is for 24 and 25 you
 
03:46:09.290 --> 03:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
can see it's a you know it's a 30 almost
 
03:46:12.530 --> 03:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
31 percent increase in the requests that
 
03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
we've got from the agencies
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that they actually
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
spent spend that then we would be in at
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know at a 62 million run rate
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
agencies do typically
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
underspend that line not all of them
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
though um
 
03:46:33.410 --> 03:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
it you know really depends on whether
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
they actually have the ability to
 
03:46:38.090 --> 03:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
execute or in some cases like we look at
 
03:46:40.010 --> 03:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh priorities change in the middle of
 
03:46:41.330 --> 03:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
the biennium and they do something
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
different than what they were planning
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
on doing that uses their resources and
 
03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
they don't end up doing the I.T project
 
03:46:50.030 --> 03:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
so it's it really there's no one thing I
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
could point to that says that is the
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
lever that gets pulled that says they're
 
03:46:56.690 --> 03:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
either going to use all their I.T
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
um direct it's budget or not but we do
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.690 --> 03:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
so that's so that's more software
 
03:47:10.849 --> 03:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
licenses and more Hardware but it
 
03:47:13.849 --> 03:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't really take more people to spend
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
that it does it does in fact because I
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't see any people counts changing
 
03:47:25.010 --> 03:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
right well um so in in uh it's if we if
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
we go towards the end of the
 
03:47:28.610 --> 03:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
presentation uh
 
03:47:32.210 --> 03:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
see I feel further down I'll take you to
 
03:47:32.220 --> 03:47:33.650 align:start position:0%
see I feel further down I'll take you to
page

03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:47:33.660 --> 03:47:37.070 align:start position:0%
page
15.

03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
these are positions that were requested
 
03:47:42.410 --> 03:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
in our initial submission
 
03:47:43.870 --> 03:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:47:46.610 --> 03:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
were not published or not approved in in
 
03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget but the agencies
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
had asked for it's a mix
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
the all but the very top line of that
 
03:47:59.530 --> 03:47:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'll jump to I'll skip mine and jump to
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
the liquor commissions for extra two
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
extra heads they uh 70s that were
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
submitted for to help them with their
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
next gen project
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
safety had asked for two and these the
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
ones that aren't 70s are are currently
 
03:48:18.590 --> 03:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
sitting as unfunded positions in my
 
03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:20.389 align:start position:0%
sitting as unfunded positions in my
budget

03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so dos asked for two Revenue asked
 
03:48:25.370 --> 03:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
for two and your revenues logic there
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
was um rather than hiring Consultants
 
03:48:30.769 --> 03:48:30.779 align:start position:0%
from there from the fast systems who
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
runs their revenue information system
 
03:48:35.150 --> 03:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund state employees
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
which is actually less expensive
 
03:48:39.130 --> 03:48:39.140 align:start position:0%
then there's
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
the area of of
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
I.T leads fish and game and Veterans
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
Home don't have an IET lead so they
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
agreed to share one in their direct
 
03:48:53.870 --> 03:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
budgets and um and so and so
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and so um we're gonna we're actually
 
03:48:59.090 --> 03:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
asking for all these positions get put
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the agencies themselves have have
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
authorized the spend inside their their
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
budget obviously you need to authorize
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
it but but
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and I think a lot of these are
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
actually division one
 
03:49:09.899 --> 03:49:11.929 align:start position:0%
actually division one
um

03:49:11.929 --> 03:49:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
um agencies as well so the top one is
 
03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
the Chief privacy officer function for
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
the state what we're seeing now there's
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
I think there's over 20 States now that
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
have a Chief privacy officer and
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a pretty mature cyber
 
03:49:29.510 --> 03:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
security program and so like if you were
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
to come ask me what are you doing about
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
this cyber security thing and do you
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
have a consistent policy and approach
 
03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:36.779 align:start position:0%
across all executive branch agencies I'd
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
be able to say yes very definitively but
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
on the Privacy side I would not
 
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I I you know I think that our privacy
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
we don't have a privacy function in in
 
03:49:49.969 --> 03:49:49.979 align:start position:0%
the state government for the executive
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
branch and uh I think it's becoming more
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
and more important I'm seeing
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
legislation coming up I'm seeing
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions coming and I think you know I
 
03:49:59.570 --> 03:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
think it would at this time it would be
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
wise for the state to invest in in this
 
03:50:03.769 --> 03:50:03.779 align:start position:0%
function and this function is really two
 
03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
ftes it's a it the way I Envision it
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's an appointed
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's an unclassified Chief privacy
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
officer who who has to go through the
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
nomination and GNC approval process so
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's that transparency to who gets
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
placed in in the position and then
 
03:50:20.690 --> 03:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a policy administrative
 
03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
support individual there
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so anyways I would I would
 
03:50:27.650 --> 03:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
I definitely would like to fund that
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's not something the agencies ask
 
03:50:31.610 --> 03:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
for it's something that I'm asking for
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
and based on what I've observed going on
 
03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the legisl our
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislations that's coming up around
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
privacy as well as things we're hearing
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
from the public things like that so
 
03:50:46.010 --> 03:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
so those are the people that are being
 
03:50:47.330 --> 03:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
so be a little more clear about what's
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
the distinction between security and
 
03:50:56.210 --> 03:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
privacy sure sure um so cyber security
 
03:50:58.330 --> 03:50:58.340 align:start position:0%
really is about
 
03:51:00.530 --> 03:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
protecting protecting from the
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
unauthorized access to data or the or
 
03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
the ability to take down systems by
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
virtue of ransoming and things like that
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
so it's it's basically
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
stopping bad things from happening
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
privacy is the the discipline and the
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
function of determining how information
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be managed inside the
 
03:51:21.359 --> 03:51:22.729 align:start position:0%
is going to be managed inside the
organization

03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:51:26.809 --> 03:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
so who get who has access to it how when
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
if at all that kind of stuff so it's
 
03:51:32.210 --> 03:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
it gets confused a lot but it really is
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
very different and stay and like I said
 
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
the um the 20 plus states that have what
 
03:51:39.650 --> 03:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
they call a CPO Chief privacy officer
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a a chief information security
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
officer and they had a Chief privacy
 
03:51:46.190 --> 03:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
officer as well
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
so so you mean like just because I'm
 
03:51:51.290 --> 03:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of dra I can't look up what
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
your taxes are or something like that
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
exactly and also I mean it's really
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
getting kind of important like you're
 
03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
seeing particularly in Europe right
 
03:52:02.450 --> 03:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
Europe was the leader on that but you
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
see it now a lot of times where
 
03:52:07.969 --> 03:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
um there's a shift in the world from
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
entities a lot of times corporate
 
03:52:13.010 --> 03:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
entities or other entities who are using
 
03:52:14.929 --> 03:52:14.939 align:start position:0%
data in a way that you didn't
 
03:52:16.610 --> 03:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about as an individual
 
03:52:18.290 --> 03:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
or authorized that's kind of the heart
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and soul of what the Privacy function is
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
is all right how do we interact with our
 
03:52:24.050 --> 03:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses in the state
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
how we're whether they're authorizing
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
our use of their data and how and how
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
that relates to all the different pushes
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
and shoves for example in some cases the
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
federal government requires us to do
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
things to access funds that we wouldn't
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily do on our own account for
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
example you know so it's mean it's it's
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a complex Art and Science all by
 
03:52:47.279 --> 03:52:54.190 align:start position:0%
kind of a complex Art and Science all by
itself

03:52:54.190 --> 03:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
so carrying on a little bit from
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's questions I
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
wish we still had Lynn over here because
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
as you recall maybe Lynn's watching saw
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
a little wave there but
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
every year we see a
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
pretty significant climb in your
 
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
requests if I recall and it was always a
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
concern of those of us that have been
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
here a long time that at some point that
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
should start going down I mean those of
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
us that run smaller businesses or you
 
03:53:28.010 --> 03:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
have your own home system you buy a
 
03:53:29.690 --> 03:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
laptop it lasts for a couple of years
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
you don't have that continual expense
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
where you cost your agency is all other
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
funds but those other funds can in fact
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
be General funds say from Corrections or
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
some other agency so what you do even
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
though there are other funds we have to
 
03:53:50.929 --> 03:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
look at the general fund impact now I'm
 
03:53:52.190 --> 03:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
like the Department of Health and Human
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
Services on page eight
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
and of course most of that's Federal
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
funding but that's a significant amount
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
of money 31 million dollars for 24 32
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars for 25 and I'm just
 
03:54:08.929 --> 03:54:08.939 align:start position:0%
curious if you could put something
 
03:54:12.290 --> 03:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
together for maybe the last six years on
 
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
what the request for just those
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
particular agencies that you have this
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
the top seven agencies
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
because it just seems we never go
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
backwards you know I did see one thing
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
in parentheses in red here somewhere but
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
we continually climb and I understand
 
03:54:31.370 --> 03:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
that uh you only went to about 90
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars and spend last year but
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about 125 million
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh for 25 it's a lot of money and again
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
people will use the argument with us
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
that well it's just other funds but it
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
really is there's a lot of General funds
 
03:54:47.809 --> 03:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
oh it is in fact Rose can you remember
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
what about what percentage are our total
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
General funds is that like 40 cents 47
 
03:54:58.210 --> 03:54:58.220 align:start position:0%
running around
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
46.7 yeah so you can kind of assume that
 
03:55:04.370 --> 03:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
whatever is approved what do we actually
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
spend about a little under 50 of that
 
03:55:09.290 --> 03:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
will be General funds and the rest will
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
be for other other you know so the color
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
of money is determined at the agency
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
level yeah but but we've we calculate
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
back particularly for uh Governor's
 
03:55:20.030 --> 03:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
offices always asking us that as he's
 
03:55:21.769 --> 03:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
developing the budget to know what
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
impacts are having a general fund
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
impacts uh certain decisions would would
 
03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:27.950 align:start position:0%
impacts uh certain decisions would would
have

03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:55:30.650 --> 03:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative evil followed by
 
03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um thanks for being here commissioner so
 
03:55:38.809 --> 03:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
I remember especially the Health and
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
Human Services I.T budget from the
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
capital budget side was always massive
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the reason for that is that
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
there were requirements for the federal
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
government in order to process payments
 
03:55:56.510 --> 03:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
and all that kind of stuff so
 
03:55:59.330 --> 03:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
is more of what I was used to seeing in
 
03:56:01.370 --> 03:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
the capital budget now in the operating
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
budget or and how much of this is
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
required as you know like it's not
 
03:56:10.030 --> 03:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
really optional whether you do it or not
 
03:56:14.530 --> 03:56:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.170 --> 03:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
HHS has a challenge right now in that
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
they have quite a few pretty old systems
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
so I think a lot of what we're seeing
 
03:56:23.929 --> 03:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
there and in fact I'm going over to
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
division three with um
 
03:56:28.849 --> 03:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
with the HHS folks next Friday to talk
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
about because division three breaks it
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
up so I'll be there for the I.T part of
 
03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
up so I'll be there for the I.T part of
it

03:56:33.290 --> 03:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh well MMI uh mmis is one of the big
 
03:56:40.010 --> 03:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
systems yeah so the so HHS has two of
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
the three largest systems in in the
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
state the three biggies are New
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first which is our Statewide
 
03:56:48.610 --> 03:56:48.620 align:start position:0%
Erp system
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility which is also
 
03:56:52.929 --> 03:56:52.939 align:start position:0%
called New Heights New Hampshire easy
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
and and the Medicaid system it's called
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
mmis so those are the three biggies so
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
two out of three of the big three of the
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
three biggies
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
all right HHS plus they have a bunch of
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
other systems and a lot of those are
 
03:57:07.319 --> 03:57:08.689 align:start position:0%
other systems and a lot of those are
transitioning

03:57:08.689 --> 03:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
transitioning
 
03:57:10.969 --> 03:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
from older technology right now to newer
 
03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
stuff and adding features to to
 
03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:14.809 align:start position:0%
stuff and adding features to to
um

03:57:14.809 --> 03:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:16.969 --> 03:57:16.979 align:start position:0%
to to mitigate the fact that they're you
 
03:57:18.950 --> 03:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
know that they're having Staffing
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
challenges like everybody else so yeah
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh I you know off the top of my head I
 
03:57:25.610 --> 03:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you exactly where that
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
stands but but I if you know one of the
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
things that if it might be interesting
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
to uh listen in on the division three
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
um hearing on next Friday because uh
 
03:57:38.570 --> 03:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
that'll I'm sure representative Edwards
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
will go deep into that
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
for that question
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
well it's it's actually more of a
 
03:57:47.330 --> 03:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
comment what we saw in the capital
 
03:57:49.969 --> 03:57:49.979 align:start position:0%
budget is we ended up spending so much
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
on I.T it actually acted to you know let
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
the leaking roofs uh continue to leak
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and as I said part of it was that
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
some of these system upgrades were
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
really being required by the feds they
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
did match but you still had to do it so
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah they're massive 10 of a lot of
 
03:58:12.950 --> 03:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
money is still a lot of money so whether
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's a 90 10 match or a 70 30 or
 
03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
whatever that yeah so indeed in fact and
 
03:58:18.300 --> 03:58:19.130 align:start position:0%
whatever that yeah so indeed in fact and
and

03:58:19.130 --> 03:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:19.140 --> 03:58:19.849 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:58:19.849 --> 03:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:22.210 --> 03:58:22.220 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of
 
03:58:25.729 --> 03:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
you know we do see a lot of additional
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
requests both on the capital side and on
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
the operating expense side through DHHS
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
for it stuff and there's not a single
 
03:58:34.130 --> 03:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
thing I look at those projects and
 
03:58:35.450 --> 03:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
there's not a single thing on there
 
03:58:37.010 --> 03:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
though like oh we shouldn't be doing
 
03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
that it's all good stuff and that and we
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
we never
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
um you know on the capital side they
 
03:58:44.929 --> 03:58:44.939 align:start position:0%
never get all the stuff they ask for
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
fund it so
 
03:58:50.769 --> 03:58:50.779 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin well
 
03:58:53.689 --> 03:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
so all of that leads
 
03:58:56.929 --> 03:58:56.939 align:start position:0%
into my question I think
 
03:58:58.849 --> 03:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
um this morning
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
you spoke about uh the number of
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
applications and I think there's like
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
600 applications and we talked about one
 
03:59:08.160 --> 03:59:09.130 align:start position:0%
600 applications and we talked about one
specific

03:59:09.130 --> 03:59:09.140 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
application that was 14 years old and
 
03:59:15.050 --> 03:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
needed to be replaced
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
is there a way
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of applications or
 
03:59:23.290 --> 03:59:23.300 align:start position:0%
are they likely to grow
 
03:59:25.969 --> 03:59:25.979 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
what is the uh typical
 
03:59:33.790 --> 03:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
lifespan of an application okay well the
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
my desire is to reduce the number of
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
applications and that relates directly
 
03:59:42.410 --> 03:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
to the Enterprise approach so if I have
 
03:59:46.250 --> 03:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
a an and HHS is doing the same thing so
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
historically what they did is they
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
implemented by division inside HHS and
 
03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
now what we're trying to do is look
 
03:59:55.130 --> 03:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
across HHS and say all right we should
 
03:59:57.769 --> 03:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
have one case management system the
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
services all are different you know
 
04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
basically I call them lines of business
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
but they call them programs and so we're
 
04:00:08.330 --> 04:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
working on so today if there's let's say
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know a half a dozen case management
 
04:00:10.680 --> 04:00:12.050 align:start position:0%
you know a half a dozen case management
systems

04:00:12.050 --> 04:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:00:14.809 --> 04:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh the strategy at HHS now is to move
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
those all to a single platform so we
 
04:00:19.370 --> 04:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
would go down from say six or eight to
 
04:00:19.380 --> 04:00:20.689 align:start position:0%
would go down from say six or eight to
one

04:00:20.689 --> 04:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:00:22.370 --> 04:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is and it didn't
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
really come out and I felt bad about it
 
04:00:26.210 --> 04:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
today at fiscal it didn't come out that
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we're not coming to
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
look for a fiscal transfer for to do a
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
to do a an upgrade we're generally
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to budget it there's certainly
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
upgrades in in the HHS budget and the
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
other agency budgets or you might see it
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
in a capital budget like for example uh
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue did there replace their 30 plus
 
04:00:48.410 --> 04:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
year old system with a with a capital
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation now this the question on
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
how long systems last
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
practically speaking you should get you
 
04:00:59.389 --> 04:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
know you're investing a lot of money to
 
04:01:01.070 --> 04:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
implement a new system
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the shorter time it lives
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
the you know the you know the more
 
04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
expensive per year it is actually to run
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
it if you amortize that out right so I
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
would think at least we should get at
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
least 10 years out of a system and and
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
then you know at a certain point you you
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
hit a diminishing curve where the the
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know technology has improved to the
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
point where you could do a lot better if
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
you replaced it but you still have to
 
04:01:26.210 --> 04:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
invest so that's the challenge of this
 
04:01:28.130 --> 04:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
the software life cycle that I spoke
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
about at fiscal this morning is you know
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
where's that line and and then you may
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
hit that line and still not get funding
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
to replace it for example labor
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
department has a long-standing LBI audit
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
finding that you know they've been
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
running a really really old 30 year old
 
04:01:44.809 --> 04:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
system and
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
which is true but they went for a long
 
04:01:48.769 --> 04:01:48.779 align:start position:0%
time without actually getting funding to
 
04:01:50.450 --> 04:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
replace it so there's that challenge as
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
well sometimes now there's a new Factor
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's come into play which is the the
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
software as a service cloud computing
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that's going to do to
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
software life cycle you know it and it
 
04:02:04.250 --> 04:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
in in software life cycle may be driven
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
by a new set of factors it's fairly new
 
04:02:09.530 --> 04:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
particularly for the state so we don't
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know a preponderance of our
 
04:02:13.490 --> 04:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
application portfolio is still running
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
in our data centers now but what we're
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
seeing is as new applications are being
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
procured by agencies we're seeing them
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
being deployed as Cloud applications in
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
the in generally in the you know
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
government clouds which are you know
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
protected from a security perspective
 
04:02:28.439 --> 04:02:30.110 align:start position:0%
protected from a security perspective
and

04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
and what's that going to mean for life
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
cycle what's going to drive changing in
 
04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
the future because the software is a
 
04:02:37.140 --> 04:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
the future because the software is a
service

04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
they they manage their own life cycle
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
inside their product you're buying a
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
subscription so it might be more
 
04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
performance of the vendor or things like
 
04:02:49.729 --> 04:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
that maybe the driver in the future
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
versus oh this is just really old and I
 
04:02:54.170 --> 04:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
need to replace it but we don't know
 
04:02:56.090 --> 04:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
because it's we're fairly new on to that
 
04:02:57.290 --> 04:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
game and that's going to be one of the
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
things where we're we're thinking about
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
as we go forward and planning is a whole
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
bunch of new things that we're learning
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
how to do as it relates both on the kind
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure side as well as on
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
the application side as it relates to
 
04:03:11.929 --> 04:03:11.939 align:start position:0%
managing in the cloud environment versus
 
04:03:13.969 --> 04:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
the old you know in my data center
 
04:03:19.130 --> 04:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.140 --> 04:03:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:03:24.530 --> 04:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps helps clarify the
 
04:03:27.170 --> 04:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
situation but if I do the math and you
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
have 600 applications and
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
you get a 10-year life cycle it's about
 
04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
60 applications a year you have to deal
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
with that's pretty intense
 
04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
yes and and we we almost never have an
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
app that lasts only 10 years
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
I might in the private sector I might do
 
04:03:48.889 --> 04:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
that and you know if you look at a
 
04:03:51.050 --> 04:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
private sector comparison you you might
 
04:03:54.250 --> 04:03:54.260 align:start position:0%
capitalize a implementation and then
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
depreciate it over a period of seven or
 
04:03:57.650 --> 04:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
ten years whatever you thought the life
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
cycle was once that was done you know
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
you you may have the financial impetus
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
to go do it again and state government
 
04:04:06.290 --> 04:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're operating leaner
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
than that and so 10 years would be
 
04:04:11.150 --> 04:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
unusual to see it happen that much it's
 
04:04:12.769 --> 04:04:12.779 align:start position:0%
more I'd say the average is probably
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
more like between 15 and 20.
 
04:04:16.739 --> 04:04:22.189 align:start position:0%
more like between 15 and 20.
foreign

04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.849 --> 04:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
I also remember from from uh from Public
 
04:04:27.889 --> 04:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
Works we used to talk about these
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
massive investments in I.T and that
 
04:04:34.370 --> 04:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
it would take two or three years to
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
actually make the purchase
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
be effective and to be installed and all
 
04:04:42.769 --> 04:04:42.779 align:start position:0%
do you do you work that into a concept
 
04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
into your operating budget or you go for
 
04:04:49.010 --> 04:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
the Big Kahuna and then
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
um do you know what I'm trying to say
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
yes exactly well the new implementations
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
the big new ones are often uh Capital
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and so we're looking at
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
usually a two to three year
 
04:05:03.530 --> 04:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
implementation plan and then we and then
 
04:05:05.330 --> 04:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
it goes in what I call
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
capex to Opex so you so so it's
 
04:05:08.760 --> 04:05:10.429 align:start position:0%
capex to Opex so you so so it's
legitimate

04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
it's it's legitimate to fund you know
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
say licenses during the implementation
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
phase with capital but it isn't once
 
04:05:19.130 --> 04:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
you're running it because that's really
 
04:05:21.290 --> 04:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
truly an operating expense so kind of be
 
04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
improper to do it with capital at that
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
point so where it might get wacky is if
 
04:05:28.490 --> 04:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
you were ahead of schedule and you were
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
running and you were using capital for
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
that or on the other side if you were
 
04:05:31.859 --> 04:05:32.630 align:start position:0%
that or on the other side if you were
late

04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
late
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
and um you know you're and you know you
 
04:05:38.150 --> 04:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
you have you don't have capital and you
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
move into an operating expense mode but
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
you actually aren't live yet so that's
 
04:05:44.330 --> 04:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
kind of the push and shove on how new
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
applications get funded replacing an app
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
is even in more complex because you say
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
you've got a run rate expense for let's
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
call it application a
 
04:05:54.180 --> 04:05:55.309 align:start position:0%
call it application a
that

04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and then now you application a is 30
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
years old and you you need to replace it
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
so now you're going to replace it with
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
application B well you're going to spend
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take you like uh
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue took three years to get theirs
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
done right and they actually did it
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
really fast compared to other states and
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
so during that time you have all the
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
expense of application a for whatever
 
04:06:22.849 --> 04:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
your implementation period is plus the
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
additional expense for implementing
 
04:06:27.290 --> 04:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
application B then and and the revenue
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
again did a great job with this as soon
 
04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
as you're live on application B you want
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
to cut out that application a expense
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
but you're double dipping for that
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
entire time
 
04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
so not only like going back to the
 
04:06:41.050 --> 04:06:41.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee discussion this morning
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
on Erp if you know Not only would a new
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
implementation be considerably more
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
expensive than than migrating to the
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
latest but also we'd be double dipping
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
that whole time
 
04:06:58.729 --> 04:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
so it's fun you actually application I.T
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
people have to be really good Finance
 
04:07:03.530 --> 04:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
people so it turns out like being a geek
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
represent Camp rails do you have any
 
04:07:13.130 --> 04:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
questions so far all right so we'll
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
continue through your presentation all
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
right well there's one page that's all
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
right this is your this is your meeting
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
so you should take it where you want to
 
04:07:21.239 --> 04:07:22.490 align:start position:0%
so you should take it where you want to
go

04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so going back to page
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
um the drivers I just wanted to make
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
sure because a lot of what you were
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
hitting on was were these things it's
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
page five
 
04:07:33.300 --> 04:07:33.950 align:start position:0%
page five
um

04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we did get you know so we hit the
 
04:07:38.570 --> 04:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
first two already pretty well
 
04:07:38.580 --> 04:07:39.229 align:start position:0%
first two already pretty well
um

04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
the and I and we just talked about the
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
what I call the capex to Opex shifting
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
from one time so it may not be as
 
04:07:48.650 --> 04:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
expensive in other words if you say uh
 
04:07:51.769 --> 04:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
I spent 10 million dollars on to
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
implement something and it's going to
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
cost me 1.2 million a year then then
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
you're going to pick up that 1.2 million
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know once you go live in in the next
 
04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
biennium so we see a lot of that
 
04:08:04.979 --> 04:08:05.650 align:start position:0%
biennium so we see a lot of that
um

04:08:05.650 --> 04:08:05.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
there's been a change in the market as
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
well our our vendors who sell to us are
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
shifting from this
 
04:08:15.889 --> 04:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
buy it
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
give me a lot of money to buy it and
 
04:08:18.479 --> 04:08:19.309 align:start position:0%
give me a lot of money to buy it and
then

04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
give me a modest amount to maintain it
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
and then every six or seven years I'll
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
make you buy it again
 
04:08:28.370 --> 04:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
very bumpy Revenue curve for them right
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
so so what they're doing now is they're
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
offering subscriptions instead so it's
 
04:08:33.769 --> 04:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
not a purchase maintenance model anymore
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's a subscription model so it's not
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
bumpy from a revenue perspective
 
04:08:42.170 --> 04:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
but for us on any one year that might in
 
04:08:45.650 --> 04:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
as we shift from a capital intensive
 
04:08:45.660 --> 04:08:46.849 align:start position:0%
as we shift from a capital intensive
approach

04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
approach
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
to implementing and paying for systems
 
04:08:52.130 --> 04:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
to to an operating expense approach it
 
04:08:54.410 --> 04:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
increases the operating expense even
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
though average cost over say a 10 or 20
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
year period is probably similar
 
04:09:01.490 --> 04:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
so so that's a factor we're seeing now
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
happening big inflation in
 
04:09:08.410 --> 04:09:08.420 align:start position:0%
uh Hardware software services
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
and the late and outside contract labor
 
04:09:14.689 --> 04:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
as well to help Implement them big
 
04:09:14.699 --> 04:09:16.370 align:start position:0%
as well to help Implement them big
increase

04:09:16.370 --> 04:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:09:18.769 --> 04:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
and then shorter equipment life cycles
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening is
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
the security and compliance world is
 
04:09:28.130 --> 04:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
driving our vendors to
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
to to a shorter life cycle now I think
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
part of that cynical because they said
 
04:09:35.150 --> 04:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
all right you know if you want to stay
 
04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
compliant you have to buy something new
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
and instead of every seven or eight
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
years now it's every five or six years
 
04:09:45.410 --> 04:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
so that you know kind of adds to the yes
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
but we must stay compliant because we
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
get audited continuously uh well we we
 
04:09:52.370 --> 04:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
must stay compliant because it's the
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
right thing to do from a cyber security
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
perspective but also we do get audited
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
continuously and um you know both on the
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
from our federal Partners as well as the
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
payment card industry and our liquor
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
business is the largest
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
um payment card um
 
04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
Revenue producer in the state and I
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
think DMV is the second largest buy but
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're not even close Liquor's way
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
I feel like the The Liquor Commission
 
04:10:23.150 --> 04:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
just recently upgraded all its credit
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
card systems but I feel like there was a
 
04:10:28.969 --> 04:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
budget request that had to do with
 
04:10:31.250 --> 04:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
upgrading that again or replacing it or
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
is my memory well believe it or not they
 
04:10:37.150 --> 04:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
did it seems like they just did but
 
04:10:40.610 --> 04:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
it actually was a while yeah I guess
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
I've been around yeah yeah no I I have
 
04:10:45.650 --> 04:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
the same thing because we just did their
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
networks over in all their stores again
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'm like didn't we just do that I'm like
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it it and we're getting better at
 
04:10:59.330 --> 04:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
doing Liquors there's so many stores and
 
04:11:01.610 --> 04:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
and have you have to have a system to
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
get it all done so we're getting a
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
little better at doing that but
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.729 --> 04:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
all right so moving on page six is kind
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
of important you've seen the the you
 
04:11:16.010 --> 04:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
know in your budget book you've seen a
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
lot of these numbers but
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I want to take you through some of
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
the how it works these different
 
04:11:24.050 --> 04:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
accounting units because it's important
 
04:11:25.729 --> 04:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
they're all very different in some
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
pretty important ways the first one is
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
direct and again I mentioned this before
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
direct is largely driven by agency
 
04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
priorities in other words we put in
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
there what they tell us to put in there
 
04:11:40.370 --> 04:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
and unless it's ridiculous or they don't
 
04:11:42.889 --> 04:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
need it but for the most part what
 
04:11:44.450 --> 04:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
they're asking for aligns with their
 
04:11:46.849 --> 04:11:46.859 align:start position:0%
Agency information technology plans and
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
and makes sense at least from an
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
operational perspective
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
so that's the biggest part of the
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
increase the the next one the 7703
 
04:11:58.929 --> 04:11:58.939 align:start position:0%
shared sir we call it shared services
 
04:12:02.330 --> 04:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
that iDrive that's called that's what I
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
call Hygiene that's the stuff that has
 
04:12:05.330 --> 04:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
to be there but you don't get any credit
 
04:12:05.340 --> 04:12:06.889 align:start position:0%
to be there but you don't get any credit
for

04:12:06.889 --> 04:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you know and everybody uses that and
 
04:12:12.050 --> 04:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
we allocated out based on a formula and
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
we'll go into that more detail later in
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
04:12:18.170 --> 04:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
is pretty large as you see
 
04:12:24.410 --> 04:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
and that is roughly 50 50. in other
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
words half of those are supporting
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
shared stuff and are being allocated out
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
according to a formula the other half is
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
direct and is being billed directly
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits to agencies
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so you saw those those additional
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
head count asks that the agencies were
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
requesting earlier in the presentation
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
those are those are the direct part
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
those would be billed directly and those
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
are at the request of the agencies
 
04:12:56.769 --> 04:12:56.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.779 --> 04:12:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the governor's approved
 
04:13:03.650 --> 04:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
budget requests that were
 
04:13:05.450 --> 04:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
talking about then I'm looking in the
 
04:13:07.490 --> 04:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
document that we have and then the
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
numbers don't line up I
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
what you have is 129 million for 24.
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
That's not including talk talk oh yeah
 
04:13:26.090 --> 04:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's Telecom
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
is added so if you look at just the
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
without Telecom it's 123 or you know the
 
04:13:37.010 --> 04:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
Telecom is 6.145 that's a that's a
 
04:13:37.020 --> 04:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
Telecom is 6.145 that's a that's a
different

04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
a different uh accounting unit okay
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah I audited it back when the after
 
04:13:45.769 --> 04:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
his presentation the other day I ran
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
back to my office and made sure the
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
numbers total numbers matched because I
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
was with something we worry about
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
so that the total numbers do match I
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
think what you're looking at doesn't
 
04:14:00.050 --> 04:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
include Telecom okay
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
which is a nice segue because I just
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
went over salaries of benefits Statewide
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
Telecom Communications is a is a
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
 
04:14:09.239 --> 04:14:10.070 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
um

04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
or dedicated fund that supports the core
 
04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
Network and and all the phones
 
04:14:20.090 --> 04:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
for executive branch and so the way we
 
04:14:21.170 --> 04:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
operate that's a little different
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's staff and um and equipment
 
04:14:30.050 --> 04:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
that gets funded in that we over collect
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
over a period of about five years and
 
04:14:36.429 --> 04:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
then we re-buy stuff without
 
04:14:39.410 --> 04:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
asking for Capital Appropriations
 
04:14:41.450 --> 04:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
so that's a nice
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's a nice transparent way to run an
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
I.T business because we're actually
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
collecting what it actually costs to run
 
04:14:51.110 --> 04:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
the business versus Under collecting
 
04:14:52.610 --> 04:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
and then coming to you for a capital
 
04:14:54.889 --> 04:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
appropriation to replace stuff
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small part of our
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
budget as you see we'd love to have it
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
be a bigger part because it's
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know as I said I think it's it's it
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
represents that shift to an operating
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
expense mode that our vendors are
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
pushing on us and so we're doing that
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
ourselves and and so that works out
 
04:15:14.809 --> 04:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
pretty well so the core network is
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
funded in that the core executive branch
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
Network which is a pretty big Network
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's fairly expensive to replace I don't
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
have to come
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
ask you you know I don't have to ask you
 
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
for additional Appropriations for that I
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to ask for Capital
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to do that we do that out
 
04:15:32.689 --> 04:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
of our regular operating the last time
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
we went before the Joint Committee for
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds we were able to show
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we were not over collecting we were
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
in fact it was amazing how close to what
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
we were collecting and what we were
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
actually needed to run the business was
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
so I know it's always a concern of over
 
04:15:48.110 --> 04:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
collecting or having a slush fund but
 
04:15:52.849 --> 04:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
so what you said it's a dedicated fund
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
what is the source because I heard that
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
they want to repeal the communications
 
04:16:04.210 --> 04:16:04.220 align:start position:0%
attack or is that oh no no that's better
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
what's that's doing I think that's
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
funding some of the um
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
some of the 911 operations and things
 
04:16:12.889 --> 04:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
like that oh okay yeah I think that
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
flows into I I could be wrong because
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
it's not my area of expertise but
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
um okay that's something different
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
what this is is basically what we do is
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
we say we calculate what does it cost to
 
04:16:27.889 --> 04:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
put a phone on somebody's desk
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what we Bill them per month
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
what does it cost with a phone plus
 
04:16:34.610 --> 04:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
voicemail and and we have a rate card
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
for that in fact we didn't bring it with
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
us but we can share right right now in
 
04:16:41.450 --> 04:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
fact a we're charging uh what's the VoIP
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.150 --> 04:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
so a basic telephone
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
um a basic telephone line that most
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
people have is
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's a purchase and where's the uh
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
where's the monthly charge
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah about 32 dollars a month that's
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
what we're charging for to put a phone
 
04:17:03.170 --> 04:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
on somebody's desk but we've got a rate
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
card and we set that rate card every
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
reset it every biennium
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's that's what drives the actual
 
04:17:09.479 --> 04:17:10.490 align:start position:0%
it's that's what drives the actual
budget

04:17:10.490 --> 04:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:17:13.490 --> 04:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
and for what and we also all of the wide
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
area network is in that so we have
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
almost 400 connections back to the
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
Mothership so our main data centers at
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
27 Hazen drive and we have almost 400
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
connections back there that support all
 
04:17:29.150 --> 04:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things anything from dot sheds
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
to uh to uh you know HHS district
 
04:17:35.929 --> 04:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
offices or the unemployment you know
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
nhes employment security has their their
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
offices so you add all of that up and
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's almost 400 connections the way we
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
do that is we take cost plus 10 and
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's what we build and the 10 percent
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
the that extra helps pay for the staff
 
04:17:53.150 --> 04:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the 10 people 10 or 11 people that we
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.729 --> 04:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the the chunks of our
 
04:18:03.889 --> 04:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
budget and how they are how they kind of
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
fit together the second table down there
 
04:18:08.450 --> 04:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
is just showing the percent increases
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's really the same numbers
 
04:18:14.210 --> 04:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
um page seven is a breakdown by glass
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
line so you can really see what the blue
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted is where all the big
 
04:18:20.450 --> 04:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
increases are and this is the total doit
 
04:18:20.460 --> 04:18:22.729 align:start position:0%
increases are and this is the total doit
budget

04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's a total of all of those accounting
 
04:18:28.610 --> 04:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
and so you can see it's Hardware
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
software and Consultants are the big the
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.370 --> 04:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
question do you think we save in the
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
number of employees we need because of
 
04:18:52.250 --> 04:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
all the I.T that we have are there any
 
04:18:52.260 --> 04:18:54.530 align:start position:0%
all the I.T that we have are there any
savings

04:18:54.530 --> 04:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say well what I can tell
 
04:18:59.090 --> 04:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is there's no way we
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
could run the business a lot of these
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
businesses with the same amount of staff
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have the technology
 
04:19:06.359 --> 04:19:08.090 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have the technology
so

04:19:08.090 --> 04:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:08.100 --> 04:19:10.490 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
in fact there was there you know I I've
 
04:19:14.689 --> 04:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
heard discussions about oh you know we
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
should what if we just got rid of these
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
systems wouldn't that save money well no
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
because then you'd have to run that
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
business manually
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we we're seeing other areas
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
where I know that we're investing in
 
04:19:25.920 --> 04:19:28.189 align:start position:0%
where I know that we're investing in
where

04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:19:28.199 --> 04:19:29.210 align:start position:0%
where
um

04:19:29.210 --> 04:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
an agency is having trouble keeping up
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
with their work and we're trying to find
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
solutions for technology that would help
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
get it done with the same amount of
 
04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
people because they're having trouble
 
04:19:38.279 --> 04:19:39.530 align:start position:0%
people because they're having trouble
recruiting

04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
04:19:41.570 --> 04:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a Focus right now too
 
04:19:44.090 --> 04:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
because of the job market and the labor
 
04:19:45.410 --> 04:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
market and trying to you know the
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
difficulty of recruiting particularly
 
04:19:51.530 --> 04:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
well kind of a follow-up
 
04:19:56.809 --> 04:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
um to representative Evil's question
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
have you ever figured out how many uh
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
seats you've vacated through technology
 
04:20:05.929 --> 04:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
I have not you have not been kind of
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
interesting it's interesting because we
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't talk generally talk about that
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
um you know when I was in my whole
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
private sector career that was the deal
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
right if you were a department
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
and you wanted X millions of dollars to
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
implement a new system
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
part of what the c financial officer
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
would say all right well
 
04:20:25.610 --> 04:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
what are you going to give me you know
 
04:20:28.189 --> 04:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
and then that is you know we don't link
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
we don't link employees back to projects
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
because this isn't how the state
 
04:20:33.600 --> 04:20:35.929 align:start position:0%
because this isn't how the state
operates

04:20:35.929 --> 04:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
operates
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell's yes thank you
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I noticed on the one of the
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
page where you showed uh the additional
 
04:20:46.370 --> 04:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
bodies that are being requested I think
 
04:20:48.889 --> 04:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
totaled six or seven
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
um upon the budget you go from 370 to
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
372 so that's an increase of two
 
04:20:56.760 --> 04:20:57.469 align:start position:0%
372 so that's an increase of two
um

04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
what what's the real number of employees
 
04:21:02.040 --> 04:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
what what's the real number of employees
yes

04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Rose Curry Director of
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
Finance for doit in the budget process
 
04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
we had 470s that were presented those
 
04:21:27.769 --> 04:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
are new positions in the 24-25 budget as
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
we went through the governor's phase
 
04:21:33.290 --> 04:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
they did not approve those positions but
 
04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
when they disapproved them for two of
 
04:21:37.250 --> 04:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
the positions they reduced the dollar
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
amount but the position count was not
 
04:21:42.349 --> 04:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
updated so as we went through the
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
process at the end of the year we'll
 
04:21:47.210 --> 04:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
figure out and come to we'll reconcile
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
the position count but the official
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
count is 374 DOI take okay follow up and
 
04:21:54.779 --> 04:21:57.189 align:start position:0%
count is 374 DOI take okay follow up and
um

04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
currently what is your your vacancy rate
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh how many open positions do you have
 
04:22:06.410 --> 04:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
that are not filled uh 12 12 percent
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome which is about
 
04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
between two between two and three
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
percent up from the norm pre-covered so
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're actually not doing horrible knock
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
on wood even though it does that extra
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
two or three percent does hurt but it's
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know I'm hearing 20 from some of my
 
04:22:27.769 --> 04:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
peers so I'm feeling better about where
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.330 --> 04:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
the consultant cost would they be what
 
04:22:36.769 --> 04:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
you had all the employees you need or is
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
that just it's amazing to me when you
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
get new software you always need to have
 
04:22:48.889 --> 04:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
Consultants not you one yes
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
um the the challenge with recruiting and
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
the Staffing levels
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the agencies does
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
drive a lot of use of Consultants
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing more of it in fact we
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
have a staff augmentation contract with
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
administrative Services has a staff
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
augmentation contract for technical type
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
people and we're the Run rate of usage
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
on that is is higher than ever right now
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
and it's driven by
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
you know that the inability to recruit
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
particularly certain skill sets in the
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
tech Arena
 
04:23:24.769 --> 04:23:24.779 align:start position:0%
there's wage inflation and Tech has gone
 
04:23:24.779 --> 04:23:25.849 align:start position:0%
there's wage inflation and Tech has gone
crazy

04:23:25.849 --> 04:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
crazy
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
and so recruiting certain skill sets and
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
they happen to be the ones that all the
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
new systems use
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
are are pretty difficult to recruit in
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.490 --> 04:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
so going to positions again and
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
following up and maybe representative
 
04:23:52.210 --> 04:23:52.220 align:start position:0%
cambrell's comments on page 12 you list
 
04:23:54.729 --> 04:23:54.739 align:start position:0%
authorized positions of
 
04:23:57.010 --> 04:23:57.020 align:start position:0%
370 at the top
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
unfunded 14.
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
so is the governor's Budget on funding
 
04:24:07.610 --> 04:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
14 of these 370 positions or no that's
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
just what we we historically carry
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions and so that's how
 
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
many we carrying in the in the
 
04:24:22.010 --> 04:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:22.020 --> 04:24:23.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
I don't remember where I was here uh
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I think you know I think I'm going to
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
skip some pages because we really
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
already went through a lot of the
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
details of
 
04:24:35.040 --> 04:24:36.469 align:start position:0%
details of
eight

04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:24:36.479 --> 04:24:41.689 align:start position:0%
eight
nine

04:24:41.689 --> 04:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.699 --> 04:24:43.729 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:47.809 --> 04:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
10 uh what's 11. you saw that's the one
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
negative number in there
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and that's simply structural I
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.560 --> 04:24:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:24:56.330 --> 04:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
um that's that I think that's structural
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
but one less pay period in in that year
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
which is what drove that because
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
typically that goes up structurally
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
because of Step increases and things
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
04:25:15.960 --> 04:25:17.090 align:start position:0%
um there is
um

04:25:17.090 --> 04:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:19.610 --> 04:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
speaking of positions on page 11 at the
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
bottom there's some requested House Bill
 
04:25:24.889 --> 04:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
two two budget Cycles ago I removed we
 
04:25:34.010 --> 04:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
we requested division one remove the
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
designations for our divisions because
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
we were in the process of kind of
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
reassessing our skill sets and our
 
04:25:40.199 --> 04:25:41.689 align:start position:0%
reassessing our skill sets and our
organization

04:25:41.689 --> 04:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:25:44.210 --> 04:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
having completed that we have names now
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the divisions and
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
we thought it important to get those
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
names into statute so all this is doing
 
04:25:54.889 --> 04:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
is essentially taking
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
putting back the names that we removed a
 
04:26:00.530 --> 04:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
couple budget Cycles ago but with the
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
actual names as they are now versus the
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
old names that we removed so that's the
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
essence of the requested hb2 language at
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change any salaries or
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
anything like that by
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
it it does not all all it does is put in
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
in statute what we're actually doing now
 
04:26:24.359 --> 04:26:26.030 align:start position:0%
in statute what we're actually doing now
okay

04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
I guess uh for the LBA something to add
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
to our hb2 list thanks yes we got we've
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
got a full list and and I don't think
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.520 --> 04:26:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:26:40.250 --> 04:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
so you on page 12 we've already been
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
there and you can see one of the things
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
I like to point out in the table at the
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 12 and you can see the
 
04:26:50.570 --> 04:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
names on the org chart you see the old
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
names that were in statute a couple
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
years ago and then the new names that
 
04:26:58.849 --> 04:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
were requesting be placed in statute
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
under that hb2 language
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
also one things we like to look at is I
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
always I always fear you know throughout
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
my history that you know we have become
 
04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
two top heavy as an organization and I
 
04:27:15.889 --> 04:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
always watch for that so
 
04:27:18.050 --> 04:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
um when I look at this I say okay that's
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
pretty good because we've got you know
 
04:27:23.450 --> 04:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
60 percent of our um
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
60 of our spend is is unclassified those
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
are the people that are out there
 
04:27:30.290 --> 04:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
getting the work done and you look at
 
04:27:32.050 --> 04:27:32.060 align:start position:0%
your your your
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
unclassified some pretty small percent
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Senior Management of the of the
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
organization so I just wanted to call
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
that out because we're I think we're
 
04:27:40.859 --> 04:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
that out because we're I think we're
running

04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:27:44.570 --> 04:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
fairly reasonable proportion there not
 
04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
not super top heavy
 
04:27:50.929 --> 04:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
a telecommunication we already talked
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
about but there is a budget footnote
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we all that's been in in the budget
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
for as long as I have been around at
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
least and
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
what that essentially does is allow us
 
04:28:03.359 --> 04:28:05.349 align:start position:0%
what that essentially does is allow us
to

04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:08.570 --> 04:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
expand excess funds beyond the
 
04:28:10.849 --> 04:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
for that once in a while big thing that
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
I described before so like if you recall
 
04:28:18.769 --> 04:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
I pointed out that this for this
 
04:28:21.170 --> 04:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund we over collect and every
 
04:28:23.809 --> 04:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
once in a while we'll have a large Buy
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's beyond the appropriation of what
 
04:28:29.689 --> 04:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
we're collecting during any in uh
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
biennial budget and that goes to the
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the other the other checking balance
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
there obviously is the Joint Committee
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
for dedicated funds where we do
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
reporting on it whenever that that
 
04:28:48.889 --> 04:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.969 --> 04:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
okay so in the page 14 is a summary of
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
all the um
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
the hb2 requests
 
04:28:57.600 --> 04:29:00.050 align:start position:0%
the hb2 requests
um

04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.290 --> 04:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
the first one again has been in statute
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think for
 
04:29:05.040 --> 04:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
I think for
um

04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
two budget Cycles now essentially what
 
04:29:10.849 --> 04:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
this allows us to do is I'll give you
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
the prime example somebody retires
 
04:29:16.010 --> 04:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
we don't think we need that position
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
anymore but we need a different one
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting an entire budget
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
cycle we we unfund the retired position
 
04:29:25.849 --> 04:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
and fund
 
04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
one of the unfunded positions so we
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
don't add positions
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
and then we hire somebody into the role
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that we need so that allows this
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
language allows us to do so it doesn't
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
allow us to overspend our appropriation
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
and allows us to operate considerably
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
more effectively inside any biennial
 
04:29:44.699 --> 04:29:46.010 align:start position:0%
more effectively inside any biennial
budget

04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
so I would request that that continue to
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
be placed
 
04:29:53.210 --> 04:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
in in house bill 2. um the the next one
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
we already spoke about which is the
 
04:29:57.290 --> 04:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
actual the naming of the divisions
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
inside doit and the last one is um
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
our Information Technology Council is in
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
statute the membership is
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
without going into detail it's in 21r
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
but the membership is agency heads
 
04:30:15.410 --> 04:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
um out you know education outside
 
04:30:15.420 --> 04:30:16.849 align:start position:0%
um out you know education outside
business

04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:30:16.859 --> 04:30:17.570 align:start position:0%
business
um

04:30:17.570 --> 04:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
County government city government and
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
two reps
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so we thought that it might be good
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
to have two more additional reps on the
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
council for two reasons one is we have
 
04:30:35.330 --> 04:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
trouble scheduling and getting more than
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
one rep at any one meeting I'd I'd like
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
to have more exposure and transparency
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
through the I.T Council so it'd be great
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
to have two or three reps at any one
 
04:30:46.439 --> 04:30:47.450 align:start position:0%
to have two or three reps at any one
meeting

04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:30:50.330 --> 04:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
and and just generally more transparency
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
I find that you know having uh
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
representatives there and participating
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the development of our strategic
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
plans and our cyber security strategy
 
04:31:01.130 --> 04:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff is helpful to us and
 
04:31:03.290 --> 04:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to you so you can kind of
 
04:31:05.809 --> 04:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing and not feel like
 
04:31:08.570 --> 04:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're out there um you're running a muck
 
04:31:08.580 --> 04:31:09.950 align:start position:0%
we're out there um you're running a muck
so

04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
um that one is important to me I'm not
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the the speaker would want to
 
04:31:18.050 --> 04:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
do it because there's a lot of you know
 
04:31:19.490 --> 04:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
assignments that have to be done but I'd
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
love to have four reps on the executive
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
on the it Council if I could
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
all those divisions all about
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
transparency as we've witnessed so far
 
04:31:28.560 --> 04:31:29.570 align:start position:0%
transparency as we've witnessed so far
this

04:31:29.570 --> 04:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:31:29.580 --> 04:31:30.649 align:start position:0%
this
term

04:31:30.649 --> 04:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:31:33.889 --> 04:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
um so the three requests I guess we can
 
04:31:36.290 --> 04:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
anyone have any issues with those
 
04:31:36.300 --> 04:31:38.929 align:start position:0%
anyone have any issues with those
collectively

04:31:38.929 --> 04:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
the yes I mean I already mentioned this
 
04:31:45.050 --> 04:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
to the to the commissioner I just know
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker isn't wild for these
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
councils anyway and I'm I'm
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'd be I don't know
 
04:31:56.330 --> 04:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'd be cautious about that just because
 
04:31:59.689 --> 04:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure what the feeling would
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
be so
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
I mean it's obviously our recommendation
 
04:32:03.899 --> 04:32:05.389 align:start position:0%
I mean it's obviously our recommendation
but

04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:10.010 --> 04:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.769 --> 04:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
yeah we're under orders to cut out a lot
 
04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
of these commissions and things like
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
that when did you ever fall award well
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:22.080 --> 04:32:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.210 --> 04:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
um no heartburn either way on that one
 
04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.939 --> 04:32:33.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:32:33.530 --> 04:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
so the we're back at the the last couple
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
of pages here which is um
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
the um the head count asks all of them
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
except the Chief privacy officers were
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
were motivated by agency requests and
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
and the agencies were willing to um
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
to spend that money and you know
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
prioritize that spend inside their
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
budgets and we after the governor
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
published his budget we went back to the
 
04:33:04.131 --> 04:33:04.141 align:start position:0%
agencies and spoke to each one of them
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
again and made sure that they wanted us
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
to ask for this and I know some of them
 
04:33:09.490 --> 04:33:09.500 align:start position:0%
already have
 
04:33:12.529 --> 04:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
I think revenue for example may have I
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
don't know for Evan has been before you
 
04:33:15.769 --> 04:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
yet but no they haven't
 
04:33:18.410 --> 04:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
but they've been before us for just a
 
04:33:20.449 --> 04:33:20.459 align:start position:0%
presentation but not a budget
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
presentation but while we're on these
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
agencies I noticed representative
 
04:33:28.970 --> 04:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
Edwards on House Bill 5 19. I guess is
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
requesting the Chief privacy officer is
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
that their Chief Financial Security
 
04:33:35.929 --> 04:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
Officer for the Department of
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Information Technology so is it Chief
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
Information Security Officer yeah yes
 
04:33:40.920 --> 04:33:41.830 align:start position:0%
Information Security Officer yeah yes
well

04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
so jive with so uh that actually
 
04:33:46.561 --> 04:33:47.090 align:start position:0%
so jive with so uh that actually
um

04:33:47.090 --> 04:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:50.449 --> 04:33:50.459 align:start position:0%
I already have so again what that
 
04:33:53.209 --> 04:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
legislation and and that resulted from a
 
04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
phone call one day on a weekend from rep
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
Edwards he's like hey you know he had he
 
04:33:59.929 --> 04:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
had had a whole bunch of cyber security
 
04:34:04.131 --> 04:34:04.141 align:start position:0%
questions for me and I answered them to
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
his satisfaction and then he said well
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
what do you need from me and I said well
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
I have a chief information security
 
04:34:13.131 --> 04:34:13.141 align:start position:0%
officer but it's not in statute so this
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that request from rep Edwards had
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note because it didn't need
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
one because I already have that position
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
established it's already been it's
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
filled and it's been filled for over a
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
decade and it's and its salary is set by
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
the jcec so it's a done deal so it's
 
04:34:32.929 --> 04:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
simply uh I call it legislative
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
for exec yeah yeah
 
04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
I'll review okay well it doesn't cost
 
04:34:45.410 --> 04:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
anything and it all it does is establish
 
04:34:47.929 --> 04:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
the role in statute which is you know my
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
role is already established so it's it's
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
just consistent with some of the other
 
04:34:54.289 --> 04:34:54.299 align:start position:0%
stuff we're doing and and it's really
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
important because
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
cyber security is a big deal so I want
 
04:35:00.830 --> 04:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that whoever the
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
individual is I'm on my third Chief
 
04:35:04.970 --> 04:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
information security officer in uh
 
04:35:06.650 --> 04:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
almost eight years I've been here so
 
04:35:06.660 --> 04:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
almost eight years I've been here so
it's

04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's a it's important that whoever comes
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
in knows what their responsibility and
 
04:35:14.449 --> 04:35:14.459 align:start position:0%
Authority is if another you know if
 
04:35:16.250 --> 04:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
somebody decides to Triple their salary
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and leave leave the state you know again
 
04:35:18.240 --> 04:35:20.449 align:start position:0%
and leave leave the state you know again
so

04:35:20.449 --> 04:35:20.459 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:20.459 --> 04:35:23.051 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:35:23.051 --> 04:35:23.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.170 --> 04:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's a couple other things in uh on
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
the last page flip over page 16 that our
 
04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
agencies had requested in the governor's
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
budget didn't get funded and they wanted
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
to have and I think liquor already may
 
04:35:40.090 --> 04:35:40.100 align:start position:0%
have spoken to you about
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
their their two head count that they
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
asked for the 270s as well as some of
 
04:35:48.410 --> 04:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
this other stuff that was on page
 
04:35:50.689 --> 04:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
16 they would like that put put into
 
04:35:52.849 --> 04:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
their budget and then Lottery had a
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
system that is really important to to
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
them that they wanted to ask us we
 
04:35:59.449 --> 04:35:59.459 align:start position:0%
confirmed again with both liquor and
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
Lottery that they wanted this stuff and
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just asking that that be
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
placed back in their their direct
 
04:36:05.760 --> 04:36:07.429 align:start position:0%
placed back in their their direct
budgets

04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
and and then the the very last thing are
 
04:36:11.890 --> 04:36:11.900 align:start position:0%
we we
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
froze our budget for the governor and
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
then we had last minute requests coming
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
in from agencies so these two bullets
 
04:36:22.730 --> 04:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
are housekeeping type requests that came
 
04:36:22.740 --> 04:36:23.929 align:start position:0%
are housekeeping type requests that came
in

04:36:23.929 --> 04:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
to us after we had closed the governor's
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
budget and they didn't have time to put
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
them in
 
04:36:28.920 --> 04:36:30.230 align:start position:0%
them in
so

04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
um so that's all that is those last two
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
and I think one of them's already being
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
one of them's already being dealt with
 
04:36:36.180 --> 04:36:39.051 align:start position:0%
one of them's already being dealt with
so

04:36:39.051 --> 04:36:39.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.250 --> 04:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
and um that concludes our uh our
 
04:36:43.260 --> 04:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
and um that concludes our uh our
official

04:36:44.330 --> 04:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
official
 
04:36:47.689 --> 04:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh testimony uh attachment a which you
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
have is the details associated with all
 
04:37:06.650 --> 04:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
that actually would go into the specific
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
agency budgets and not you orders both
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
actually because the what happens is
 
04:37:16.910 --> 04:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
they end up in their class 27 line and
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
then they end up in our detail lines so
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
they're in both places that's why it's
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
really important it's confusing
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
it requires coordination and if you look
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget you'll see there's acts so
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
basically it gets double counted and
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
then there's a place down low somewhere
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget where the double count is
 
04:37:40.609 --> 04:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.189 --> 04:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I have to compare I'm just looking at
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
the additional prioritized needs for
 
04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
liquor which you had identified here and
 
04:37:52.010 --> 04:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a lot of things not
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
lining up
 
04:37:53.879 --> 04:37:54.890 align:start position:0%
lining up
um

04:37:54.890 --> 04:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:56.090 --> 04:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to look at that a little
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
more yeah I'll give you the I was done
 
04:37:59.570 --> 04:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
before I was going to comment because
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
liquor did send us what they asked for
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
and it didn't look like what we had so
 
04:38:06.051 --> 04:38:06.061 align:start position:0%
no I would agree different I would agree
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
with you like they were asking for more
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
money correct I think it's into the
 
04:38:11.170 --> 04:38:11.180 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
but it may not be the same thing so yeah
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
we if you want what we'll do is we'll
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
take the action of going back to Tina
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
and Joe
 
04:38:20.689 --> 04:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
and reconcile that and get that back to
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
you ASAP
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll we'll make a copy of this for
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
you and make sure we get the numbers
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
eight there was some confusion with
 
04:38:30.051 --> 04:38:30.061 align:start position:0%
their numbers as well so we'd ask them
 
04:38:31.970 --> 04:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
for some additional information so we'll
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
get you this we were scrambling with
 
04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
liquor a little bit because their their
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
testimony was pretty quick and after the
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
after the governor had released his
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
budget and and so we we we probably
 
04:38:44.209 --> 04:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
caused some of that confusion just
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
because we were trying to do it quickly
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
yeah they're uh I.T wants here are much
 
04:38:51.890 --> 04:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
more substantial than what you are
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
showing so it's yeah some of that may
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
not be in our class 27 too because
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
liquor has stuff that they spend on
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
store operations that isn't always in
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
our class 27 budget you might be in one
 
04:39:05.090 --> 04:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
all right well I'll give you this and
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
other further questions for
 
04:39:13.010 --> 04:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the deputy or
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.529 --> 04:39:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.010 --> 04:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
second table what maybe some of the
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
really big drivers are of the 30 and 20
 
04:39:38.330 --> 04:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
almost 25 percent increases are there
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you have them yeah but
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're pretty eye-popping and we might
 
04:39:45.890 --> 04:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
explain them as we get into it well the
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
we do have the drivers for the 25 and
 
04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's on page
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the the 30 is a little more complicated
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
because it's agency by agency but we can
 
04:40:06.170 --> 04:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
get we can get that well I mean there
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
may be some really no we we can
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
definitely do that but I would say I I
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question on as it
 
04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
relates to the shared service portion is
 
04:40:17.448 --> 04:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 10. okay and um it
 
04:40:20.570 --> 04:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's three different areas it's the you
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
know inflation of
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hardware cost it's the
 
04:40:29.208 --> 04:40:29.218 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise the the Microsoft 365
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
costs which are everybody who's running
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
Microsoft 365 in the world is seeing
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
increases there both in terms of how
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
much of it we're using as well as they
 
04:40:41.090 --> 04:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
had a price increase for their for their
 
04:40:41.100 --> 04:40:42.590 align:start position:0%
had a price increase for their for their
um

04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:45.850 --> 04:40:45.860 align:start position:0%
for their platform and then
 
04:40:49.130 --> 04:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
we're spending uh contract money a
 
04:40:51.650 --> 04:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
little above what we had historically
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
done to support the um some of our
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
projects that we're working on and
 
04:41:00.650 --> 04:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually a great example
 
04:41:00.660 --> 04:41:02.270 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually a great example
um

04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:04.610 --> 04:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
back filling staff that we don't have
 
04:41:09.288 --> 04:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.730 --> 04:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
you're welcome we'll get you that other
 
04:41:18.368 --> 04:41:18.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
thank you much have a good weekend
 
04:41:23.550 --> 04:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for your great work there
 
04:41:23.560 --> 04:41:25.970 align:start position:0%
thanks for your great work there
[Music]

04:41:25.970 --> 04:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:41:28.330 --> 04:41:28.340 align:start position:0%
we could have made it without you guys
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.520 --> 04:42:10.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:42:10.970 --> 04:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
whatever page we were on with the
 
04:42:20.330 --> 04:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
additional requests uh page 16 16.
 
04:42:22.368 --> 04:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
there's an item from
 
04:42:24.410 --> 04:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
for lottery
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
that division two was ready to approve
 
04:42:33.170 --> 04:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
but we usually coordinate between the
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
divisions and the LBA analysts to make
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
sure that both divisions are in
 
04:42:37.860 --> 04:42:39.470 align:start position:0%
sure that both divisions are in
agreement

04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:42:40.970 --> 04:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the word that they heard yesterday
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
from the lottery was that it wouldn't
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
impact any Revenue to the education
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
04:42:50.400 --> 04:42:51.708 align:start position:0%
trust fund
so

04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
so your recommendation is we I would put
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
a check mark there if division two is
 
04:42:59.448 --> 04:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
happy and they've been
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
um assured that there's no Revenue
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
impact than it
 
04:43:04.850 --> 04:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's probably good to go everybody good
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:43:06.900 --> 04:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
with that
yes

04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.010 --> 04:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
yeah although there's some overlap like
 
04:43:15.890 --> 04:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
with oit and you'll see as we go further
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
along you probably remember from last
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that
 
04:43:22.010 --> 04:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
overlap and
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of confusing and that's why
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
we have people like the treasurer here
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
to help us out
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
so nice to see you madam treasure if you
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
come forward and
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have a handout you're
 
04:43:46.010 --> 04:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:50.090 --> 04:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
so 164 everybody if you're looking
 
04:43:54.900 --> 04:44:28.750 align:start position:0%
so 164 everybody if you're looking
foreign

04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the records
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the treasurer Monica mazzapelli and I'll
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
be using the handout just to facilitate
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
the um the discussion and then the
 
04:44:41.930 --> 04:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
references that I included in the
 
04:44:41.940 --> 04:44:43.368 align:start position:0%
references that I included in the
handout

04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I hope I'm using the right document
 
04:44:48.050 --> 04:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
is is the actual um Governor's budget
 
04:44:51.050 --> 04:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
document that was posted on the
 
04:44:52.368 --> 04:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
um Department administrative services
 
04:44:54.288 --> 04:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
website I'm still trying to orient
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
so I will start with
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
um just a brief overview of our agency
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
the State Treasury and the first the
 
04:45:11.930 --> 04:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
second page of the handout which is I'm
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
as you know we are responsible for um
 
04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're us we're a central uh Service
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
Agency responsible for processing
 
04:45:30.410 --> 04:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
um our cash and debt management
 
04:45:30.420 --> 04:45:31.730 align:start position:0%
um our cash and debt management
um

04:45:31.730 --> 04:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
business of the state and um in
 
04:45:39.650 --> 04:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
as part of um as part of what we do we
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
have our offices structure and and if
 
04:45:45.170 --> 04:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
there are essentially two divisions but
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
um this budget is proposing one change
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the structure and I'm also
 
04:45:55.368 --> 04:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
using another section of our office to
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
really highlight a piece that has not
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
been highlighted in the budget which is
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
the college savings scholarship program
 
04:46:05.930 --> 04:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
so if we move to uh page three it's just
 
04:46:07.368 --> 04:46:07.378 align:start position:0%
I'm describing
 
04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
um again the areas that our office is
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
focusing on and that are now part of the
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
um for the first time we are split in
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
what we call our trashy operation
 
04:46:23.410 --> 04:46:23.420 align:start position:0%
treasury operations and it's now where
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
we as part of our agency budget we
 
04:46:29.690 --> 04:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
requested to split that office into and
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
create the office of investment and debt
 
04:46:34.010 --> 04:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
management the office of debt management
 
04:46:37.010 --> 04:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
is actually established in RSA 6B but it
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
was never really clarified in the Statue
 
04:46:44.090 --> 04:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
so we decided to do that because a year
 
04:46:46.550 --> 04:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
ago we prepare a three-year strategic
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
plan and as part of you know the the
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
goals and and what we were discussing as
 
04:46:53.208 --> 04:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
part of our what we want to see over
 
04:46:55.490 --> 04:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
time and the treasury
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
um we realized that the um the sum of
 
04:47:00.050 --> 04:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
the roles and responsibilities needed to
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
be clarified so this is a little bit of
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping internal housekeeping to be
 
04:47:06.288 --> 04:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
able to um
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
again be in compliance with the Statue
 
04:47:11.690 --> 04:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
attract expenditures and the budget in a
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
better way provide transparency and and
 
04:47:17.930 --> 04:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
also clarify some of those roles and
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of some positions that
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
will help us with succession planning
 
04:47:25.128 --> 04:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
and and all sorts of goals that we have
 
04:47:25.138 --> 04:47:26.330 align:start position:0%
and and all sorts of goals that we have
so

04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
um so that's a difference you will see
 
04:47:28.260 --> 04:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
um so that's a difference you will see
that

04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:31.368 --> 04:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
um difference in this budget compared to
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
previous budgets
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
we also have our random property
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
division this the division responsible
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
for the claim property program and the
 
04:47:43.730 --> 04:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
stay we return property that gets
 
04:47:46.250 --> 04:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
reported to us and remitted to us and we
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
report that we return that to a rightful
 
04:47:48.600 --> 04:47:50.270 align:start position:0%
report that we return that to a rightful
owner

04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
owner
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:47:53.810 --> 04:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
um the the last piece that we highlight
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
as part of our office is our College
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
savings scholarship program so we've had
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
this program so sometimes but now we
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a position that is supporting
 
04:48:06.288 --> 04:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
um you know in addition to treasure and
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
the deputy Treasurer who did the work
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
before now we have a specific position
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
that supports those programs who are
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
which are very um they take a lot of
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
time in our office so we're trying to
 
04:48:21.288 --> 04:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
again just clarify those roles and and
 
04:48:24.170 --> 04:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
all of this is in our budget so
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so page four is just um
 
04:48:30.650 --> 04:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
right now we have 23 positions this body
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
is actually abolishing one it position
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
and it will go down to 22 positions and
 
04:48:39.050 --> 04:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
this this this this this or chart the
 
04:48:40.910 --> 04:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
only minor changes
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
um this section that relates to
 
04:48:44.570 --> 04:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
investment and debt management uh we
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
just again move some positions to define
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
those roles and responsibilities so it's
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
a minor change but it's important to our
 
04:48:51.120 --> 04:48:53.570 align:start position:0%
a minor change but it's important to our
department

04:48:53.570 --> 04:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.090 --> 04:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
um so on page three um you take
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
questions during your presence
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely anytime Mr chairman are there
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:49:05.090 --> 04:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
I do have one nobody else does
 
04:49:07.368 --> 04:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
so you just mentioned that you're
 
04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
eliminating an I.T and I see that you're
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
migrating to our state doit is that
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
going to save you money or is it going
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
to cost you money to
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
I would assume you're going to save some
 
04:49:22.010 --> 04:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
money because you're eliminating a
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
position but I'm just curious of the
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
cost difference
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes no that's a great question that was
 
04:49:29.208 --> 04:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
going to be my next point so yes so as
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
part of yeah so as part of what we're
 
04:49:33.288 --> 04:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
proposing a diff a difference in this
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
budget as we we would like to migrate to
 
04:49:41.448 --> 04:49:41.458 align:start position:0%
doit so the state treasury the T the T
 
04:49:43.250 --> 04:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
component of the treasury was always
 
04:49:46.430 --> 04:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
in-house and we had two positions in the
 
04:49:49.128 --> 04:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
past supporting the entire operation and
 
04:49:51.410 --> 04:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
it was just a sign that way since the
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
very beginning of time and as you heard
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Goulet cyber security
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
is a big deal it's really important and
 
04:50:02.090 --> 04:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
we've had the I.T position that we want
 
04:50:04.850 --> 04:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
to abolish we've had a vacant for some
 
04:50:06.650 --> 04:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
time and it has been practically
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
impossible to fill it and so the
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
decision is we want to grow our tea
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
Department which is essentially
 
04:50:14.810 --> 04:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
impossible or we want to just you know
 
04:50:17.930 --> 04:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
move with doit and the rest of the group
 
04:50:20.448 --> 04:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
and again as you heard the work that
 
04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet is doing it's all
 
04:50:24.288 --> 04:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
about protecting the state it's all
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
about you making ensure our
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is safe and so to me it
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
was a no-brainer to request this change
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
the governor approved that and I just
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
hope is is you know continuous with this
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
but so the the answer to your question
 
04:50:40.610 --> 04:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
is yes we're gonna save some money
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
abolishing the position it's gonna the
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the general fund portion is gonna
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
increase slightly compared to what we've
 
04:50:50.030 --> 04:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
been paying because
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
um we still have one it person that will
 
04:50:54.530 --> 04:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
coordinate the work between the treasury
 
04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
and and the uit and but this person has
 
04:51:00.770 --> 04:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
done an amazing job to protect our
 
04:51:05.090 --> 04:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
treasury to protect our bank accounts to
 
04:51:08.030 --> 04:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
keep our costs down but that's about to
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
change slightly if we move with the rest
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
of the group which again is is all to
 
04:51:15.050 --> 04:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
benefit the treasury and the benefit the
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
state as a whole to be protected
 
04:51:19.730 --> 04:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
made me think about that that decision
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
was the fact that Duit was receiving all
 
04:51:27.050 --> 04:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
this Federal funding and and you know
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
support from legislature and the
 
04:51:31.128 --> 04:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
governor and unfortunately as a little
 
04:51:32.690 --> 04:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
house you know it house we weren't
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
getting anything so this didn't feel
 
04:51:34.378 --> 04:51:35.208 align:start position:0%
getting anything so this didn't feel
right

04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of the reason so
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be a slight increase but I
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
think overall obviously after that you
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
won't see any changes but um it will be
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
part of what the uit requests every year
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's so that's the second
 
04:51:52.910 --> 04:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
change in this in this request in this
 
04:51:52.920 --> 04:51:54.350 align:start position:0%
change in this in this request in this
budget

04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:51:54.360 --> 04:51:55.430 align:start position:0%
budget
um

04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
again minor things but um important to
 
04:51:58.200 --> 04:52:00.890 align:start position:0%
again minor things but um important to
us

04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and um again
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
we do have a question
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair well in the
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
interest of efficiency wouldn't the
 
04:52:11.570 --> 04:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
employee that's working for you in IIT
 
04:52:15.530 --> 04:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
move over to doit or wouldn't they want
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
to hire him since he has a lot of
 
04:52:17.160 --> 04:52:18.288 align:start position:0%
to hire him since he has a lot of
knowledge

04:52:18.288 --> 04:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:52:21.530 --> 04:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
and and I'm and I'm they did ask that
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
the unfortunately the funding for that
 
04:52:26.448 --> 04:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
position is with the abandoned property
 
04:52:29.208 --> 04:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
so abandoned property base for that so
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
changing the funding mix
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
um didn't seem appropriate because
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
unless unless you want to play that
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
position with General funds so then we
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
want to keep that position with us to um
 
04:52:43.970 --> 04:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
again to facilitate all of that there's
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
some pieces that so so the request today
 
04:52:51.250 --> 04:52:51.260 align:start position:0%
is to migrate essential I.T
 
04:52:53.810 --> 04:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
components not everything so for example
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
this I.T person uh who's going to stay
 
04:52:58.610 --> 04:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
with us will will still coordinate and
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
manage other other systems that we have
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
for example for the unclaimed property
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
program we deal with a vendor and he's
 
04:53:08.930 --> 04:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
the person responsible and and that
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
works with our vendor and to to support
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
the unclaimed property system the same
 
04:53:17.810 --> 04:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
with our banks you know we use
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
um online banking and all of that is
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
overseen by this person the uit doesn't
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
want to get involved in online banking
 
04:53:26.690 --> 04:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
and in all of this other systems so
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're just getting basic services from
 
04:53:28.980 --> 04:53:30.350 align:start position:0%
we're just getting basic services from
doit

04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
doit
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so moving on to
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
page five it's just again um with the
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
creation of this office of investment
 
04:53:43.208 --> 04:53:43.218 align:start position:0%
and debt management is really a new
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
activity code that we're creating and so
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
we moved all our debt service under that
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
um activity code
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so speaking about that service on
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
page five
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
um we are
 
04:53:56.520 --> 04:53:57.708 align:start position:0%
um we are
um

04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
that is really our largest well in
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
addition to meals and rooms tax
 
04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
distribution this is our largest
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
expenditure so the treasury expenditures
 
04:54:10.970 --> 04:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know the for the Department of
 
04:54:12.530 --> 04:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
Treasury are very small is about two to
 
04:54:14.930 --> 04:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
three percent of our total budget The
 
04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
Debt Service
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
um is another large portion but
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that's for the entire state so
 
04:54:24.050 --> 04:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
we we we house uh our debt service The
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
Debt Service that we pay and
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um our outstanding debt continues to
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
decline but our debt service so and so
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
in this particular budget we are in
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
order to budget and estimate what our
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
debt service is going to be so in
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
addition to our existing that service we
 
04:54:43.970 --> 04:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
are assuming that we will issue 60
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
million in 60 million in bonds each year
 
04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
and that's what um and that's the debt
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.610 --> 04:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
um so we also um I guess one comment I
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
want to add is
 
04:55:00.060 --> 04:55:01.850 align:start position:0%
want to add is
um

04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:04.970 --> 04:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
the The Debt Service the principal and
 
04:55:09.288 --> 04:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
interest of the bonds that help pay for
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
the Rems project from the for the
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
revenue information management system
 
04:55:17.810 --> 04:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
project that dra has
 
04:55:21.410 --> 04:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
um now that that service by law I needed
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
to um be paid beginning in fiscal year
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
22 from this a dedicated fund that they
 
04:55:31.010 --> 04:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
created they established uh called the
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
revenue information management system
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
account so in beginning of first year 22
 
04:55:37.010 --> 04:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
that that service is being paid from
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
that fund so be 422 that was paid with
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
General funds now is being paid with
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
this dedicated fund we try to ask dra to
 
04:55:51.170 --> 04:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
put that that service line in their
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
budget unfortunately with all the
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
discussions and we tried again with the
 
04:55:57.730 --> 04:55:57.740 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but that didn't happen
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that can happen and during
 
04:56:03.530 --> 04:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
the house phase but if not we just we
 
04:56:05.570 --> 04:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
will deal with that it's really just the
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
location of what that service line
 
04:56:10.850 --> 04:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
um just like all of the agencies that
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
have there are self-funded they pay
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
there on that service we typically see
 
04:56:18.288 --> 04:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
that that service line and their budget
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
right now it's sitting in our budget as
 
04:56:23.810 --> 04:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
older Revenue so it really makes more
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
sense to move it to dra but again it's a
 
04:56:28.010 --> 04:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
tactical thing that perhaps we could fix
 
04:56:30.050 --> 04:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
in the future there's not enough to time
 
04:56:30.060 --> 04:56:31.730 align:start position:0%
in the future there's not enough to time
or

04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:56:34.128 --> 04:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
um because tra will have to add it to
 
04:56:35.930 --> 04:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
could you get an explanation to us I was
 
04:56:40.250 --> 04:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
very good but something in writing that
 
04:56:43.128 --> 04:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
to the LBA we can take a look at that
 
04:56:46.250 --> 04:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely represent Maguire
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so am I right that
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
the total State debt is somewhere not
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
including unfunded pension is something
 
04:56:57.128 --> 04:56:57.138 align:start position:0%
like 1.2 billion
 
04:57:00.288 --> 04:57:00.298 align:start position:0%
yes for our Geo bonds uh actually for
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
all of our bonds revenue bonds and and
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
general obligation bonds I think
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
including turn by include intern
 
04:57:07.850 --> 04:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
practice oh let's start a stop yes could
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
we get a is there a list in here about
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
which areas are in have debt and like
 
04:57:18.170 --> 04:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
that Turnpike is so much and you know
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
UNH is so much and I can certainly get
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
that for you as is not included in this
 
04:57:25.610 --> 04:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
in this presentation the presentation so
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
what we house in our budget we pay
 
04:57:30.410 --> 04:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
general fund um
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
we we include so our budget includes
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
Geo Debt Service
 
04:57:39.410 --> 04:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
that is paid with General funds it is so
 
04:57:42.770 --> 04:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
it also includes a portion that we pay
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
for the University system of New
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also what um we what the
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
school building ate that service and the
 
04:57:54.288 --> 04:57:54.298 align:start position:0%
community college debt service
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
so those are the components all of the
 
04:58:00.288 --> 04:58:00.298 align:start position:0%
other Debt Service as in the individual
 
04:58:02.690 --> 04:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
agency budget so for example fishing
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
game has their own Debt Service
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
in Turnpike highway so the only ones
 
04:58:10.368 --> 04:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
that we keep here and the treasury are
 
04:58:12.650 --> 04:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
general fund funded with General funds
 
04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
and those that I just mentioned and
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're really because they don't really
 
04:58:17.810 --> 04:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
have a house anywhere else they end up
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:58:23.090 --> 04:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
um could I continue yeah thank you so
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
the 60 million we're paying
 
04:58:28.610 --> 04:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
this is interest and principle yes
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay on so it's on a
 
04:58:33.770 --> 04:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
fraction of that 1.2 billion is that
 
04:58:34.970 --> 04:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that is what I'm
 
04:58:37.550 --> 04:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
saying yes okay so do you know how much
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
roughly or is it
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
so this is the annual Debt Service
 
04:58:42.480 --> 04:58:43.190 align:start position:0%
so this is the annual Debt Service
um

04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
that is scheduled to be paid or
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
projected to be paid in fiscal 24 and
 
04:58:47.520 --> 04:58:49.368 align:start position:0%
projected to be paid in fiscal 24 and
25.

04:58:49.368 --> 04:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
25.
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that relates that number relates to
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
just the general fund portion of the
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
state so it total that's so out of the
 
04:58:59.810 --> 04:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
total outstanding of the 1 billion that
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned only about
 
04:59:05.770 --> 04:59:05.780 align:start position:0%
500 and close to 600 million
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
belongs to a general fund just get that
 
04:59:08.520 --> 04:59:09.890 align:start position:0%
belongs to a general fund just get that
number

04:59:09.890 --> 04:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:59:09.900 --> 04:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
number
okay

04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the general fund piece
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the piece that we um
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
in our when when
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
um when we asked for a recommendation of
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
how much should be bonded typically we
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
we mentioned about 120 million for the
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
biennium so 60 million for each year and
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what and it's only the self
 
04:59:34.680 --> 04:59:36.288 align:start position:0%
so that's what and it's only the self
um

04:59:36.288 --> 04:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
um it's only the general fund portion
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
that we suggest anything that is paid
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
with other funds essentially
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
if the agencies have how to pay it then
 
04:59:48.288 --> 04:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
that's that's they can pay it but we
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
worry about the uh the tax what we call
 
04:59:54.288 --> 04:59:54.298 align:start position:0%
what we call the tax supported debt
 
04:59:55.970 --> 04:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the one that we typically
 
04:59:58.010 --> 04:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
pay more attention to right so if we
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
borrow 120 billion for the biennium
 
05:00:03.288 --> 05:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
million yes sorry 120 million for the
 
05:00:05.208 --> 05:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
buyer yes million
 
05:00:08.288 --> 05:00:08.298 align:start position:0%
um and we pay back
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
66 or something yes is that because six
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
is interest and six and
 
05:00:17.770 --> 05:00:17.780 align:start position:0%
and 120 is
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
re-going the principle for the principle
 
05:00:20.218 --> 05:00:21.530 align:start position:0%
re-going the principle for the principle
yes

05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:00:21.540 --> 05:00:22.610 align:start position:0%
yes
um

05:00:22.610 --> 05:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:24.890 --> 05:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
what's our current interest rate on this
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
kind of debt budget itself has the
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
breakdown actually I should have it has
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
um is principle and interest it's just
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
not the obviously the budget um
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
at that level doesn't have the detail
 
05:00:41.820 --> 05:00:42.830 align:start position:0%
at that level doesn't have the detail
but

05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so for example for 24
 
05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
yes 42 42 million is going to be
 
05:00:52.970 --> 05:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
principal and 20 million is going to be
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
05:00:57.530 --> 05:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
so so yeah so I I guess to
 
05:01:00.410 --> 05:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
to answer your question or or in general
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
we paid
 
05:01:05.810 --> 05:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
um we have us we structure our debt in a
 
05:01:07.610 --> 05:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
way that we can pay
 
05:01:10.448 --> 05:01:10.458 align:start position:0%
more principle during the first 10 years
 
05:01:13.550 --> 05:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
60 of the principal as paid during the
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
first 10 years and the other 40 percent
 
05:01:17.930 --> 05:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
during the other 10 years so this is a
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
20-year Bond so we try to have this more
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
aggressive way of paying our debt and
 
05:01:24.770 --> 05:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
that works really well for us this is
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I mentioned is
 
05:01:27.360 --> 05:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I mentioned is
a

05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:01:31.970 --> 05:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
um the benefits of the state it's it's a
 
05:01:33.890 --> 05:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
credit positive we call it because the
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
rating agencies like the way we handle
 
05:01:38.448 --> 05:01:38.458 align:start position:0%
and our debt management our policy how
 
05:01:41.690 --> 05:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
do you have us do you have a sense
 
05:01:48.050 --> 05:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
if we had an extra 100 million dollars
 
05:01:50.930 --> 05:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
say um if we put it towards retirement
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
saving retirement
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
um unfunded liability versus putting it
 
05:02:01.730 --> 05:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
in the um rainy day fund
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
would it be sort of a wash as far as our
 
05:02:08.810 --> 05:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
our credit rating goes or is it not
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
quite or what do you think the the
 
05:02:14.208 --> 05:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
rating agencies would like to see more
 
05:02:16.910 --> 05:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
money in the rainy day font and the
 
05:02:19.368 --> 05:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because they wanna
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
they wanna make sure that our state is
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
prepared for the next next downturn so
 
05:02:28.250 --> 05:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
if we have our capacity which is the 10
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the unrestricted Revenue
 
05:02:33.170 --> 05:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
they would love to see that amount and
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund the unfunded
 
05:02:35.458 --> 05:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund the unfunded
liability

05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:02:42.530 --> 05:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
along with all of our debt in general we
 
05:02:46.368 --> 05:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
are a low debt state is is so compared
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
to our expenditures and our revenues the
 
05:02:51.288 --> 05:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
amount that we have it
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
in total of that it's it's just we have
 
05:02:56.570 --> 05:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
a very lower ratio so it's it's a very
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
good um position that we have so they
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
would rather see us increase our
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
reserves to be prepared for the next
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know a time of concern or any
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
emergencies that will come up
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
again the the the liabilities are not
 
05:03:16.610 --> 05:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
high compared to in our overall position
 
05:03:19.970 --> 05:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
of the state okay now
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
would you say the last few years was an
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
emergency did it affect the the uh
 
05:03:29.208 --> 05:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability at all
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability of the state of
 
05:03:34.850 --> 05:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
the pension I mean the um the rainy day
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
fund yeah so for example for example yes
 
05:03:39.890 --> 05:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so when we had
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
um the economic downturn in 2020
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the rate indices were expecting that
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
all states were using money for from the
 
05:03:49.550 --> 05:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund because that's the time
 
05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
where you want to use it when you
 
05:03:54.050 --> 05:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue performance when you were
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
expecting a deficit that's it that's the
 
05:03:58.010 --> 05:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
that's the time and that's how the law
 
05:03:59.690 --> 05:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
is written to be able to do it in those
 
05:03:59.700 --> 05:04:01.128 align:start position:0%
is written to be able to do it in those
times

05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
um anything else is not really an
 
05:04:05.090 --> 05:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
emergency you have other you know if you
 
05:04:07.128 --> 05:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
want to use the money from the rainy day
 
05:04:08.208 --> 05:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
fund that's really not called an
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
emergency so that could you know that
 
05:04:10.020 --> 05:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
emergency so that could you know that
could

05:04:10.970 --> 05:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:04:12.890 --> 05:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
raise questions as to why that's
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
happening we could always try to justify
 
05:04:17.628 --> 05:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
it but uh but you know it again it
 
05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
really has to be that and the law allows
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
us to do that just for for deficit
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
projected deficits and um in uh when
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue sign up before so did you see a
 
05:04:31.010 --> 05:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
dip during 2020 in the rainy day fund so
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
so the way the state handle it
 
05:04:36.770 --> 05:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
um that's when the governor froze higher
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
in and that's when we had to um some
 
05:04:41.090 --> 05:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
agencies were asked to reduce their
 
05:04:44.090 --> 05:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
spending by 20 so the way to stay
 
05:04:47.448 --> 05:04:47.458 align:start position:0%
managed expenditures we didn't have to
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
tap into the rainy day font so that was
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
well seen I mean the way we were able to
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
manage our our operations and again we
 
05:04:58.490 --> 05:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
had a um to the point that one of the
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
rain agencies gave us uh you know right
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
now we have a positive outlook and
 
05:05:05.050 --> 05:05:05.060 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the step before
 
05:05:08.810 --> 05:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
potentially we get um an upgrade so
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
um again it all has to do how we manage
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
further questions from the division
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil thanks just uh real
 
05:05:23.448 --> 05:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
quick so what is our rating at this
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
point from the rating agencies for a
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
bond yeah so Moody's is double a one SMP
 
05:05:34.730 --> 05:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
is double A and for fetches double A
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
Plus so twist close to the highest is
 
05:05:37.680 --> 05:05:38.990 align:start position:0%
Plus so twist close to the highest is
one

05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
it is excellent yes
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative kimbrells thank you Mr
 
05:05:51.170 --> 05:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
chair just secure our city question uh
 
05:05:53.930 --> 05:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
and the abandoned property division uh
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
how long do you try to reach the
 
05:05:59.448 --> 05:05:59.458 align:start position:0%
rightful owner and is there a limitation
 
05:06:01.490 --> 05:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
and after which you get to keep the
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
money for for the state
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question so for
 
05:06:08.448 --> 05:06:08.458 align:start position:0%
the Vandal property program we we
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
received a property from from the
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
holders and the status says if we can't
 
05:06:17.090 --> 05:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
return that property within three years
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
we um
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
we as cheat funds to the counties and
 
05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund however the rifle
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
owners can always come back and ask us
 
05:06:31.250 --> 05:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
for their money so what we do and that
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
will lead me to my next
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
piece of my my presentation
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
um if I can find My Documents now oh
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
here it is while you're looking for your
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
documents they're just going to back you
 
05:06:45.170 --> 05:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
up a bit on our indebtedness yes so on
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
page 169 uh you paid off about 55
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
million in 22 and I see that in 24 and
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
25 we're adding in a little more than
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
five million dollars you're assuming
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
obviously the governor's budget and
 
05:07:04.970 --> 05:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
there are a number of items I guess he's
 
05:07:07.610 --> 05:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
put in there to bond could you give us a
 
05:07:10.610 --> 05:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
list of those projects that are causing
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
that number to elevate itself yeah so I
 
05:07:16.490 --> 05:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
I could certainly give you yeah you'll
 
05:07:17.930 --> 05:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
have to do it to now but you know right
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
but I think I could probably give you
 
05:07:21.530 --> 05:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
the reason of the difference so I think
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
I think so that the 55 million is low so
 
05:07:29.170 --> 05:07:29.180 align:start position:0%
in general our debt Services declining
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
in in what is happening right now is so
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
so actually the activity in 22 has to do
 
05:07:40.490 --> 05:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
is has two reasons one is we did a
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
refund then we should re we we should
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
refunding Bonds in 2021
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
2020 and when we did that we achieved
 
05:07:53.690 --> 05:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
significant savings that were applied
 
05:07:59.330 --> 05:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 no 2020 and no I'm
 
05:08:02.650 --> 05:08:02.660 align:start position:0%
sorry 21 in
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
22. so we saw so with that because we
 
05:08:09.650 --> 05:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
essentially removed Prince we removed
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
some bonds from the market we paid a
 
05:08:13.490 --> 05:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
significant amount with those refunding
 
05:08:16.250 --> 05:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
bonds so those uh Debt Service savings
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
we again we apply them and fiscal year
 
05:08:23.208 --> 05:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 and that was about 11 million
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
dollars so with that sort of
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
restructuring we we that's the that's
 
05:08:30.770 --> 05:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
what you see The Debt Service that we
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
pay that's sort of the result of that
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
refunding the other thing that is
 
05:08:38.410 --> 05:08:38.420 align:start position:0%
happening is we as I mentioned before
 
05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
we planned or we say we we're going to
 
05:08:43.970 --> 05:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
issue about a 60 million dollars in
 
05:08:43.980 --> 05:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
issue about a 60 million dollars in
bonds

05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
05:08:48.410 --> 05:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
but but that but that didn't happen over
 
05:08:50.448 --> 05:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
the last couple of times we issued bonds
 
05:08:53.570 --> 05:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is one when we were
 
05:08:55.730 --> 05:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
having the pandemic the governor also
 
05:08:59.170 --> 05:08:59.180 align:start position:0%
froze Capital expenditures so we Bond
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
based on spending not so much we don't
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
say we're going to bond 60 million this
 
05:09:07.610 --> 05:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
year we bomb because what we do is we
 
05:09:07.620 --> 05:09:08.948 align:start position:0%
year we bomb because what we do is we
spend

05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
spend
 
05:09:11.930 --> 05:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
the spending occurs we only issue once a
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
year and so then we we see how much has
 
05:09:16.368 --> 05:09:16.378 align:start position:0%
been spent over the last six months and
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
we say okay we're only going to need to
 
05:09:18.000 --> 05:09:18.890 align:start position:0%
we say okay we're only going to need to
bond

05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
bond
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
30 million 50 million or whatever the
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
amount is and we also project how much
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're gonna again we're not gonna we
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
don't think we're gonna Bond again
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
another year so we we take the actual
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
spending project the spending and we
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
determine an amount so those amounts
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
have been lower than the 60 million and
 
05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's the reason the debt service has
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
been decreasing so the Assumption of in
 
05:09:44.090 --> 05:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
2024 and 2025 we are assuming again
 
05:09:47.208 --> 05:09:47.218 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue 60 million bonds
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the increase could
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
you give us those assumptions it's not
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
today but yeah so it's very simple it's
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
just as soon as assuming that we're
 
05:09:58.490 --> 05:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to use 60 million and what the
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
projects may be that gets you to that
 
05:10:00.718 --> 05:10:02.090 align:start position:0%
projects may be that gets you to that
assumption

05:10:02.090 --> 05:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
so not now but you know
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
at some point I don't need you to try to
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
recall but you know at some point just
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
give us an idea why it's going up and
 
05:10:14.690 --> 05:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
what your assumptions are based on
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
giving us the 60 and 63 million so sure
 
05:10:20.208 --> 05:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
I can slowly share the products that go
 
05:10:22.368 --> 05:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
behind that I know the governors
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
proposed a number of projects and I'm
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
just curious are they hoping to bond
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
those I know some are coming out of a
 
05:10:30.288 --> 05:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund but just a list so we can
 
05:10:34.010 --> 05:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
have an idea what our bonds costs are as
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
they may be in here well it's a variety
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
of things but yeah
 
05:10:41.208 --> 05:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
clarify so when we when we project this
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
amount they're not really tied to
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
specific specific products
 
05:10:48.110 --> 05:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I can probably show you some of again
 
05:10:51.050 --> 05:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
we look at what husbands spend so we
 
05:10:52.970 --> 05:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
look at Capital
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
um expenditures we look at fund 30 and
 
05:10:57.530 --> 05:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
we see okay these are all the projects
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
all these ages have spent all this money
 
05:11:01.490 --> 05:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what we are planning on
 
05:11:03.230 --> 05:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
bonding so we're about to issue bonds
 
05:11:05.208 --> 05:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
right now and that's that's what we're
 
05:11:07.490 --> 05:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
doing we are looking at okay how much
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
ages have spent how much revenue they
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
have collected because some of those
 
05:11:14.330 --> 05:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
projects are fair of funds funded with
 
05:11:16.610 --> 05:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
federal funds so we take what it's it's
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
what's essentially just going to be
 
05:11:21.530 --> 05:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
paired with General funds and that's the
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
amount we bonds so it's it's not
 
05:11:26.830 --> 05:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
essentially linked to a specific project
 
05:11:31.128 --> 05:11:31.138 align:start position:0%
is is more in aggregate like we bomb for
 
05:11:34.010 --> 05:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
we don't know what at some point we have
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
to identify what products we have to
 
05:11:38.570 --> 05:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
bomb because for tax purposes we do have
 
05:11:40.368 --> 05:11:40.378 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we track those
 
05:11:44.208 --> 05:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
expenditures for uh for IRS purposes
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
um but when we're projecting these
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
numbers in the beginning just to prepare
 
05:11:50.090 --> 05:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
the budget they're not really tied to
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
specific projects because if obviously
 
05:11:55.368 --> 05:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
we don't bond anything I know that's not
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
the case because I know there's a line
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
in there for taking money from the
 
05:12:02.030 --> 05:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
liquor fund in here but there's another
 
05:12:04.330 --> 05:12:04.340 align:start position:0%
line that says it's coming out of the
 
05:12:07.368 --> 05:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund for 14 million dollars so
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious on how that assumption
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
I mean again don't you don't have to go
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
any further now but just okay it's give
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
us something so we have an idea how you
 
05:12:19.250 --> 05:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
get to that assumption okay because to
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
me it should be going down if we're not
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
bonding many projects or depending on
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the size of the projects but yes so so
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
it will go down so this is a very
 
05:12:32.208 --> 05:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
conservative assumption so in reality we
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
use this number and likely if we if we
 
05:12:36.530 --> 05:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
don't bond that we wouldn't want to bond
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
more than that but if we don't bond that
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
it just lapses right
 
05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
right but yeah
 
05:12:44.090 --> 05:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
further questions represent evil I just
 
05:12:44.100 --> 05:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
further questions represent evil I just
remember

05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
remember
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
um when I was on capital budget we used
 
05:12:49.250 --> 05:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
to get confused because we thought you
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
bonded by project which isn't what you
 
05:12:53.930 --> 05:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
do at all you just sort of
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
do this aggregate
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
got almost kind of a thing it's exactly
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
that we don't we don't look at specific
 
05:13:04.850 --> 05:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
project it has to so once we Bond we do
 
05:13:06.830 --> 05:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
have to specify what Pro and like our
 
05:13:09.050 --> 05:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
bond documents include a list of
 
05:13:09.060 --> 05:13:10.610 align:start position:0%
bond documents include a list of
projects

05:13:10.610 --> 05:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:13:13.550 --> 05:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but those and this is going down into
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
the weeds but those could actually be
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
swapped for others if for example if
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
some projects take too long to sometimes
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know again we take spec expenditures
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
and if a project started and all of a
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
sudden is delay for whatever reason and
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
we need to you know for again for our
 
05:13:34.730 --> 05:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
for our Arbitrage rules we need to
 
05:13:38.208 --> 05:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
verify that the money gets spent so if
 
05:13:40.610 --> 05:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
the if the agency is not spending fast
 
05:13:43.610 --> 05:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
enough we need to swap what's behind the
 
05:13:46.570 --> 05:13:46.580 align:start position:0%
bond to make sure that we are funding
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
projects that are really moving so we
 
05:13:51.650 --> 05:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
have to always monitor the projects that
 
05:13:53.930 --> 05:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
are part of those bonds that we issue
 
05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
but when we are issuing bonds
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we take a less that we think is going
 
05:14:01.368 --> 05:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
to be funded with that money
 
05:14:03.128 --> 05:14:03.138 align:start position:0%
but that could be flexible
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I think
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm probably asking it prematurely but
 
05:14:15.050 --> 05:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll be an introduction to your
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
next section
 
05:14:19.610 --> 05:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
how how big is the abandoned property
 
05:14:19.620 --> 05:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
how how big is the abandoned property
number

05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:23.040 --> 05:14:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:14:23.810 --> 05:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
well I think overall and I just asked
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
that question recently
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
um in total I think we have about
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
three million 300 million dollars in
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property in total
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
um some of it has been as cheated to the
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
general fund as I was as describing
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
earlier but I think in total that's
 
05:14:48.650 --> 05:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
that's the number
 
05:14:48.660 --> 05:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
that's the number
um

05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
again when when you know if if that's
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
property that was received
 
05:14:56.690 --> 05:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the number exactly of
 
05:14:58.850 --> 05:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
the property that
 
05:14:58.860 --> 05:14:59.570 align:start position:0%
the property that
um

05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
we've had for three years not not as
 
05:15:04.970 --> 05:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
cheated yet um but I can certainly get
 
05:15:06.650 --> 05:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
you that number
 
05:15:09.050 --> 05:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
um and if I met Mr chair if I could
 
05:15:10.490 --> 05:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably continue that way I could
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
probably describe
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to get you know
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
um just need to make sure I take all my
 
05:15:22.250 --> 05:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
all my questions with me all the
 
05:15:24.410 --> 05:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
questions when they yeah so so the next
 
05:15:26.810 --> 05:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
section it was um I guess this is a
 
05:15:28.250 --> 05:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
request and the treasury doesn't really
 
05:15:34.010 --> 05:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
have a requests often and but page six
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
um we're we're asking for the first time
 
05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
we're asking
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
to budget the amount
 
05:15:43.610 --> 05:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it is what we we call in the law is
 
05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
called subsequent
 
05:15:47.690 --> 05:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
um subsequent claims and those are those
 
05:15:47.700 --> 05:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
um subsequent claims and those are those
claims

05:15:49.310 --> 05:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
claims
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh the the money or the fun the property
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
that has been is cheated to the general
 
05:15:57.650 --> 05:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
fund we as I mentioned before we do
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
return the property to any person who
 
05:16:02.090 --> 05:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
comes forth asking for you know they
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
found the money we we do pay that we we
 
05:16:07.368 --> 05:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
do pay that money but the current the
 
05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
the way we've been doing it the way the
 
05:16:12.410 --> 05:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
structure currently currently reads is
 
05:16:14.330 --> 05:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be approved by
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
government Council so
 
05:16:16.400 --> 05:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
government Council so
every

05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
time government executive Council meets
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
we have to go and ask for the
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
authorization to so that so the
 
05:16:28.550 --> 05:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
controller can issue a warrant for money
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
so otherwise otherwise not appropriated
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
and to be able to give his authority to
 
05:16:35.448 --> 05:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
pay those funds and that has been going
 
05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
on since 19 since 1985 and
 
05:16:39.958 --> 05:16:40.610 align:start position:0%
on since 19 since 1985 and
um

05:16:40.610 --> 05:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:42.890 --> 05:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
this is the first time we're asking to
 
05:16:44.990 --> 05:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
put an amount and the budget is really
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that we're asking is 2.6
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
million which is
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
um about this about the month that we
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
pay every year
 
05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
um relative to this post SG claims and
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
the reason we're doing this is
 
05:16:59.040 --> 05:17:00.650 align:start position:0%
the reason we're doing this is
um

05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
first of all it seems less transparent
 
05:17:04.970 --> 05:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
or it will look be more transparent to
 
05:17:06.708 --> 05:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
show the amount that we pay if we
 
05:17:08.750 --> 05:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
include it in the budget the second
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
piece says sometimes it just takes too
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
long to issue this check so if we have
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
to wait two weeks in order to to issue
 
05:17:19.010 --> 05:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
these checks the claimants will like to
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
have their money A little bit sooner so
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's one reason there are times that
 
05:17:24.530 --> 05:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
the executive Council only meets once a
 
05:17:26.750 --> 05:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
month and during those times those those
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
folks have to wait even longer about a
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
month for for their checks so by
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
providing the authority to have the
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
money and the budget and giving us
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
authority to issue those checks as soon
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
as we're able to verify that that's the
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
right person then we'll be able to make
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
these payments and so this will require
 
05:17:45.890 --> 05:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
a change in in the law so that was
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
including household to the governor
 
05:17:51.770 --> 05:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
agreed to do this and um this will help
 
05:17:54.770 --> 05:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
obviously the public will be better
 
05:17:57.530 --> 05:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
customer service and what what we're
 
05:18:01.070 --> 05:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting here is is to um
 
05:18:03.890 --> 05:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
you know if the one point if if the 2.6
 
05:18:06.050 --> 05:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars is not enough we can
 
05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
always go back to
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal committee and the governor
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
Council to to essentially ask for more
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
money but again is the law that allows
 
05:18:16.610 --> 05:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
us to pay these funds in perpetuity this
 
05:18:18.350 --> 05:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
would just facilitate and make it more
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
efficient to to be able to make this
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
payments more timely and to you know
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
obviously this folks as soon as they
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
find they realize they have money they
 
05:18:28.970 --> 05:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
didn't know they had they want to have
 
05:18:31.010 --> 05:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
their money right away so this will help
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
with that process
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
questions on this item absolutely
 
05:18:34.798 --> 05:18:39.170 align:start position:0%
questions on this item absolutely
representative

05:18:39.170 --> 05:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.180 --> 05:18:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
Griffin

05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
05:18:43.490 --> 05:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
05:18:43.500 --> 05:18:45.288 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
um so after a period of three years see
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
a street law
 
05:18:53.208 --> 05:18:53.218 align:start position:0%
comes in to date does that change the
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
list or is the is is there a public list
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
and Does it include
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
all the abandoned properties since the
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
original the state law was passed
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know so every every October so so
 
05:19:11.090 --> 05:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes as part of our requirement we have
 
05:19:15.650 --> 05:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
we we publish we issue a publication so
 
05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
every year in October we we issue a list
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and then the union leader we use the
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
unit leader to prepare that list and um
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
that list contains all of the new
 
05:19:34.368 --> 05:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
property that we received during the
 
05:19:37.850 --> 05:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
last reporting year so that led to the
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
newspaper that you see in the union
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
leader every October only includes the
 
05:19:44.570 --> 05:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
new property the rest of the property
 
05:19:46.610 --> 05:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
you could always find that by going to
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
our website so on our website we have we
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
now have the ability
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and businesses and anyone
 
05:19:56.208 --> 05:19:56.218 align:start position:0%
can go to our website and search for
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
property and and they'll be able to find
 
05:20:01.090 --> 05:20:01.100 align:start position:0%
out property since the beginning of time
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
now now we can also issue claims so the
 
05:20:06.530 --> 05:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
the you know the the individual and the
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
companies can actually initiate claims
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
right online so we've we've improved our
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
technology in order to allow that
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and then also individuals com
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
companies can always go to
 
05:20:22.490 --> 05:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
missingmoney.com that's also linked to
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
our missing money come as a place say
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
you know it's for property all over the
 
05:20:30.970 --> 05:20:30.980 align:start position:0%
country and but now there's um because
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
missingmoney.com has a new vendor and
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's the same vendor we use for
 
05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property system now when
 
05:20:39.890 --> 05:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
someone searches in that website that
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
claims comes directly into our database
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
and we're able to issue that immediately
 
05:20:46.250 --> 05:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
and then we just need to verify that
 
05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's the right person
 
05:20:50.208 --> 05:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
hope I answer your question for the
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
question represent Griffin represent
 
05:20:52.440 --> 05:20:53.868 align:start position:0%
question represent Griffin represent
Maguire

05:20:53.868 --> 05:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
05:20:56.570 --> 05:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so is this the
 
05:20:56.580 --> 05:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so is this the
money

05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about under current
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
expense on page 172
 
05:21:04.970 --> 05:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
um the money that we're talking about is
 
05:21:07.850 --> 05:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
on page 166
 
05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
um that is called
 
05:21:10.020 --> 05:21:17.628 align:start position:0%
um that is called
um

05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's called return of general fund
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
deposit and that has always been in sort
 
05:21:24.770 --> 05:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
of housed in my office but never
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
appeared in the budget before so this is
 
05:21:30.110 --> 05:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
the first time that we actually budgeted
 
05:21:32.810 --> 05:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
in an amount like if you look at our
 
05:21:34.368 --> 05:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
statement appropriation so the
 
05:21:37.250 --> 05:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
accounting system you're gonna see
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
um what has been actually the expenses
 
05:21:42.170 --> 05:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
right there so the fiscal year 22 shows
 
05:21:46.010 --> 05:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
an amount of 2.6 million
 
05:21:48.050 --> 05:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
um obviously the fiscal year 23 is
 
05:21:49.490 --> 05:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
showing nothing because we never budget
 
05:21:52.010 --> 05:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
or anything but with this new biennium
 
05:21:55.550 --> 05:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
we are we are suggesting asking if we're
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
able to budget at 2.6 million in every
 
05:22:01.010 --> 05:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
so there'll be corresponding income then
 
05:22:07.490 --> 05:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
to this 2.6 so as general fund so
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
because we have exceeded this money to a
 
05:22:12.170 --> 05:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
general fund essentially
 
05:22:14.810 --> 05:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
um we need to take it back from the
 
05:22:17.170 --> 05:22:17.180 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
well yeah so let's go to page 172.
 
05:22:23.810 --> 05:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
is this a different this is the same
 
05:22:31.970 --> 05:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
I would love to fix this too but I think
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
the number in
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
um scheme is a little bit uh has been
 
05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
there for a long time
 
05:22:45.730 --> 05:22:45.740 align:start position:0%
172. so so that so page 172 is is
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:22:51.410 --> 05:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
the cost of the division itself so
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
um that is what is really just the
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
administration of running the program
 
05:23:00.650 --> 05:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's what that is and it's paid yes so
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
so the law allows us to pay for this
 
05:23:04.378 --> 05:23:05.810 align:start position:0%
so the law allows us to pay for this
cost

05:23:05.810 --> 05:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:23:08.448 --> 05:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
from the abandoned property that we have
 
05:23:08.458 --> 05:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
from the abandoned property that we have
yes

05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:23:11.570 --> 05:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
but that's the property that hasn't is
 
05:23:13.610 --> 05:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
cheated to the general fund once it has
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
changed to general fund the sort of we
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
have sort of two buckets the previous
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
cheat and the process cheat and the
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
Prius she pays for the cost of
 
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
administration the the the other money
 
05:23:27.890 --> 05:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
that 2.6 is is general fund I hope I
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
explained myself well well we had a
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
fantastic flow chart of how
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
adequate education when the governor did
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
his presentation you saw this flowchart
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
of how adequate education is calculated
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
right is this plus this plus this minus
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
that maybe in this area we could make
 
05:23:53.350 --> 05:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of flow chart that
 
05:23:55.970 --> 05:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
goes from here to the general fund down
 
05:23:58.448 --> 05:23:58.458 align:start position:0%
there you know something like that
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm wondering this whole area is
 
05:24:04.730 --> 05:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
three million dollars spending right but
 
05:24:07.970 --> 05:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
half of it is current expenses
 
05:24:10.610 --> 05:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
is that checks going to people or is
 
05:24:12.530 --> 05:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
that something else no current expenses
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
is we have contracts with auto firms
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that do Audits and they
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
participate in this state this um
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide audit so for example
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
um they are firms that go all over the
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
country to find holders of abandoned
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
property so sometimes these firms
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
um they audit these insurance companies
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
and their multiple states that
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
participate in this audit so for example
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
so so then these other firms that we
 
05:24:43.730 --> 05:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
05:24:46.670 --> 05:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
um they're the ones that um you know do
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
search records of companies and they
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
determine this is how much you company
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
or all of these various States so
 
05:24:57.410 --> 05:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
they're multi-state Audits and that's
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
what we bought it in this current
 
05:24:58.920 --> 05:25:00.650 align:start position:0%
what we bought it in this current
expense

05:25:00.650 --> 05:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
expense
 
05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
um we we bought it a large amount
 
05:25:06.770 --> 05:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't because we because we
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
contract with multiple firms there are
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
about 10 firms right now and sometimes
 
05:25:16.128 --> 05:25:16.138 align:start position:0%
and we only pay them when they find
 
05:25:19.250 --> 05:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
property they're on a retainer
 
05:25:19.260 --> 05:25:20.410 align:start position:0%
property they're on a retainer
um

05:25:20.410 --> 05:25:20.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
type contract and so if they find
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
property we pay them
 
05:25:27.770 --> 05:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
um 10 I think is is around that
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
percentage of that of of that property
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
they find so we don't know how much
 
05:25:34.010 --> 05:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to find every single year
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
but we have to budget enough to try to
 
05:25:39.170 --> 05:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
have again and have enough money to pay
 
05:25:41.628 --> 05:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
them when they come back to say okay
 
05:25:43.610 --> 05:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
we're bringing you all this property
 
05:25:45.770 --> 05:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's time to pay us
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
but it looks sorry proposing it it looks
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
like we're spending three million
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
dollars per year to return 2.6 million
 
05:25:59.448 --> 05:25:59.458 align:start position:0%
to people yeah I mean and that the 2.6
 
05:26:03.050 --> 05:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
million is only the general fund portion
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
we we return about between six and seven
 
05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
million in total each year oh okay in
 
05:26:13.010 --> 05:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
this this three million total cost is is
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
is to run the operation I don't think
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's just the whole department or the
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
whole section it's it's the division but
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes so current expenses is significant
 
05:26:25.550 --> 05:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
but again that's the reason we we um
 
05:26:27.650 --> 05:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we we just have to
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
build it in a way that is we're going to
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
have enough money that 3 million is in
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
total yes for that division but um we
 
05:26:40.128 --> 05:26:40.138 align:start position:0%
collect from in general every year we we
 
05:26:42.410 --> 05:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
collect or we receive property of about
 
05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
20 million each year
 
05:26:47.208 --> 05:26:47.218 align:start position:0%
we don't get to return it all is so it's
 
05:26:49.970 --> 05:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
we return some between six and seven
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
million each year
 
05:26:54.288 --> 05:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
um the rest the general fund gets it
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
and okay so we need to see the line
 
05:26:59.208 --> 05:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
where that 14 million is coming to the
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
general yeah I can certainly provide you
 
05:27:03.288 --> 05:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
with a different presentation I I wasn't
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
how the how we how that works how much
 
05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
we achieved to general fund the formula
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps you will want to see what's
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
involved in that absolutely thank you
 
05:27:14.690 --> 05:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
we're kind of an unruly bunch here so
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
you never know what's going to expect
 
05:27:18.170 --> 05:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
happy to come back happy to be here all
 
05:27:18.180 --> 05:27:19.030 align:start position:0%
happy to come back happy to be here all
afternoon

05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
05:27:21.890 --> 05:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative kimberles yes thank you
 
05:27:24.170 --> 05:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I'm assuming you you
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's about 300 million
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's being held that hasn't been
 
05:27:32.330 --> 05:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
returned to the uh owners yet I'm
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
assuming you're getting interest on that
 
05:27:38.208 --> 05:27:38.218 align:start position:0%
if it's other than an account and if so
 
05:27:39.650 --> 05:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
um do we get to keep any of that
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
interest or the does the whole the owner
 
05:27:47.448 --> 05:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
get the interest on top of the money
 
05:27:49.490 --> 05:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
that they were owed originally
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
great question the owner doesn't get the
 
05:27:53.690 --> 05:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
interest so
 
05:27:53.700 --> 05:27:54.830 align:start position:0%
interest so
um

05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
they get their property but not the
 
05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
interest so so no we so the jail so the
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
state benefits from that so the interest
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
is is we invest that we invest that
 
05:28:06.128 --> 05:28:06.138 align:start position:0%
money in the state keeps it
 
05:28:10.010 --> 05:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
yeah and just out of curiosity what is
 
05:28:11.810 --> 05:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
it invested in a relatively conservative
 
05:28:14.330 --> 05:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
type of fund so what are the percentage
 
05:28:16.490 --> 05:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
returns because 300 million if you get
 
05:28:19.490 --> 05:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
10 interest is 30 million a year but I
 
05:28:22.430 --> 05:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
doubt it's 10 percent so once this is
 
05:28:24.530 --> 05:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
cheated to a job fund it really doesn't
 
05:28:27.050 --> 05:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's not segregated it's all part of our
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
poo cash so our pool cash is all
 
05:28:31.730 --> 05:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
invested in you know the way we invest
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
when we have access cash so we we have a
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
a portfolio we invest in a variety of
 
05:28:42.530 --> 05:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
types of um Securities but it's all part
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:28:46.368 --> 05:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
um you know strategy how we invest our
 
05:28:48.770 --> 05:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
operating funds so it's no once this is
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
to your digital fund is no longer seen
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
as okay this came from the abandoned
 
05:28:53.760 --> 05:28:55.970 align:start position:0%
as okay this came from the abandoned
property

05:28:55.970 --> 05:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
so our interest rate right now so this
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
is what I was sharing with me ways it
 
05:29:05.520 --> 05:29:06.410 align:start position:0%
is what I was sharing with me ways it
means

05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
means
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
um last week so right now we're
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
anticipating that we you know the yield
 
05:29:12.650 --> 05:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
is going to be about four percent
 
05:29:14.570 --> 05:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
um in the neighborhood of four percent
 
05:29:16.250 --> 05:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
and we we think it's going to stay like
 
05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
that over the next couple of years just
 
05:29:20.090 --> 05:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
because again we're trying to take
 
05:29:22.128 --> 05:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
advantage of the market
 
05:29:22.138 --> 05:29:22.910 align:start position:0%
advantage of the market
um

05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're investing in
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
instruments that allow us to have
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
um that you know higher yield and within
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously our boundaries within our
 
05:29:33.410 --> 05:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
investment policy
 
05:29:41.690 --> 05:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:41.700 --> 05:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
unrelated

05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
apparently there's another expression of
 
05:29:50.638 --> 05:29:51.730 align:start position:0%
apparently there's another expression of
Hawaii

05:29:51.730 --> 05:29:51.740 align:start position:0%
Hawaii
 
05:29:57.050 --> 05:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
so our state prison was built in 1878
 
05:29:59.690 --> 05:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
and uh so the governor seems to think
 
05:30:02.350 --> 05:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
it's worn out after 150 years
 
05:30:04.690 --> 05:30:04.700 align:start position:0%
I know you
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know why but anyways and he
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
wants us to build a 350 million dollar
 
05:30:10.440 --> 05:30:11.690 align:start position:0%
wants us to build a 350 million dollar
prison

05:30:11.690 --> 05:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
prison
 
05:30:14.570 --> 05:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
how should we pay for it
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
correct question
 
05:30:18.490 --> 05:30:18.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer that
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
right I I get to um maybe should we save
 
05:30:24.530 --> 05:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
should we borrow should we do some
 
05:30:27.230 --> 05:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
combination I guess you know
 
05:30:29.570 --> 05:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great question
 
05:30:32.570 --> 05:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so as I mentioned every biennium we
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that we should stay within the
 
05:30:37.930 --> 05:30:37.940 align:start position:0%
120 million
 
05:30:37.940 --> 05:30:39.788 align:start position:0%
120 million
range

05:30:39.788 --> 05:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
range
 
05:30:42.708 --> 05:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
so it's 300 million is a lot more than
 
05:30:45.708 --> 05:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
what we would suggest and again we we
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't really suggest that we just
 
05:30:48.890 --> 05:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
essentially prepare and we're about to
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
issue our debt affordability study where
 
05:30:54.050 --> 05:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
we actually essentially take 120 million
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the biennium we say this is what the
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
Rachel's will look like will will look
 
05:31:00.730 --> 05:31:00.740 align:start position:0%
like over the next five to seven years
 
05:31:03.708 --> 05:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
and we want to see those ratios low the
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
ratio debt to revenue ratio so
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what we want to see
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
because that's what keeps our ratings uh
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
05:31:14.868 --> 05:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we stay with that and
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
then we also know that borrowing costs
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
are gonna you know they have increased
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
really and they will probably stay like
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
that for some time until it's you know
 
05:31:25.850 --> 05:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
clear when things will change
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so that's a great question I mean it
 
05:31:29.690 --> 05:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
could be a combination of borrowing and
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
and paying with General funds it could
 
05:31:34.250 --> 05:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
be I mean one of the things that we we
 
05:31:37.610 --> 05:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
are like to say too is
 
05:31:37.620 --> 05:31:38.270 align:start position:0%
are like to say too is
um

05:31:38.270 --> 05:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
when when
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna issue bonds for capital
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
projects we also have to take a look at
 
05:31:44.878 --> 05:31:45.830 align:start position:0%
projects we also have to take a look at
the

05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:49.490 --> 05:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the life span of that particular
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
project so sometimes now we're using
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
bonds to pay for it costs so hopefully
 
05:31:58.850 --> 05:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
those it costs are going to last longer
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
than 10 years 20 years because we issue
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
bonds for 20 years a prison likely will
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
last us a lot longer in 20 years so
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps that could be you know a
 
05:32:12.288 --> 05:32:12.298 align:start position:0%
possibility to bond for 30 years not I'm
 
05:32:14.448 --> 05:32:14.458 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that but that again
 
05:32:17.330 --> 05:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
because of the type of
 
05:32:19.730 --> 05:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
capital investment that we would the
 
05:32:21.890 --> 05:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
state will make so that could probably
 
05:32:21.900 --> 05:32:23.448 align:start position:0%
state will make so that could probably
fit

05:32:23.448 --> 05:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
fit
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
um again depend you know so there are a
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
variety of options that the state could
 
05:32:27.718 --> 05:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
variety of options that the state could
consider

05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:32:32.570 --> 05:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
um to do that
 
05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
you asked that question
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
um so what are the interest rates you're
 
05:32:45.530 --> 05:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
anticipating us getting on our bonds
 
05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's a great question too
 
05:32:48.120 --> 05:32:49.128 align:start position:0%
yes that's a great question too
um

05:32:49.128 --> 05:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
so I will probably like right now that
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm the four percent range
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so the municipal Market is different
 
05:32:59.810 --> 05:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
than obviously a getting a mortgage
 
05:33:01.730 --> 05:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
um so it all depends on the uh the
 
05:33:04.730 --> 05:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
municipal Bond again Market
 
05:33:07.128 --> 05:33:07.138 align:start position:0%
um we issue bonds
 
05:33:09.770 --> 05:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
um in series so some of them are five
 
05:33:12.890 --> 05:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
years 10 years 15 years 20 years and
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
they all have different rates
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
um the shorter and of or the shorter
 
05:33:21.170 --> 05:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
short-term rates are
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
um are higher than the long-term rates
 
05:33:26.470 --> 05:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
like the 20-year or less
 
05:33:29.628 --> 05:33:29.638 align:start position:0%
so I guess in on average it could be
 
05:33:31.128 --> 05:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
about four percent that's what we're
 
05:33:31.138 --> 05:33:32.510 align:start position:0%
about four percent that's what we're
thinking

05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:33:32.520 --> 05:33:34.010 align:start position:0%
thinking
um

05:33:34.010 --> 05:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:36.110 --> 05:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
because I that that would be my answer
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
right now it could be less
 
05:33:41.448 --> 05:33:41.458 align:start position:0%
um does our rating affect the interest
 
05:33:45.288 --> 05:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
rate that's what I thought it does so
 
05:33:48.530 --> 05:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
um we get a better rate if we have a
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.530 --> 05:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
but not by much right I mean if we were
 
05:34:00.170 --> 05:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
you said we're next to the top right if
 
05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
we were the top
 
05:34:04.010 --> 05:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's like an eighth of a percent or
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
something right is it it's not a lot it
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
does it varies and it depends on the the
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
time of the market but uh it we've we've
 
05:34:14.570 --> 05:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
been very fortunate New Hampshire has um
 
05:34:17.690 --> 05:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
we don't we only issue once a year and
 
05:34:19.788 --> 05:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
so investors like our bonds so when it's
 
05:34:21.288 --> 05:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
time for us to issue we've been there
 
05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
for tonight and the bidders give us a
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
very good rate so
 
05:34:28.850 --> 05:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
um so Soma could say that we get we
 
05:34:32.690 --> 05:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
could look like a AAA type issue
 
05:34:34.368 --> 05:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
um it all depends on the market but we
 
05:34:37.010 --> 05:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know again folks that want investors
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
out there that like to diversify that
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
like our bonds for sure
 
05:34:41.040 --> 05:34:43.010 align:start position:0%
like our bonds for sure
so

05:34:43.010 --> 05:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the the spread and the
 
05:34:47.090 --> 05:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
um that depends on a variety of factors
 
05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
and and the time of the market too but I
 
05:34:53.628 --> 05:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
can provide you with some information if
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
you like to see you know just the
 
05:34:56.448 --> 05:34:56.458 align:start position:0%
difference I don't have it right now but
 
05:34:58.430 --> 05:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean they're comparable States
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
Mike that's right are there are there
 
05:35:03.410 --> 05:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
comparable states that have a similar
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
yes and yes and again I don't have that
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
list right now but but in terms of um
 
05:35:15.948 --> 05:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
the rates are very specific like the
 
05:35:18.410 --> 05:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
market dictates typically okay this is a
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
triple A rate today this is a um you
 
05:35:25.010 --> 05:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
know double a rate today so they they or
 
05:35:27.050 --> 05:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
or obviously last one what they call
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
junk junk bonds so they have obviously
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
different prices per se
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so you can certainly see what the
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
market really dictates so how those
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
rates look like yeah I'd be curious
 
05:35:39.288 --> 05:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
about Maine specifically because I know
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
their retirement system is in better
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
shape than ours
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
so and I don't have I can certainly get
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
to that because I do have I do get a
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
report where I get all of the state's
 
05:35:49.920 --> 05:35:52.550 align:start position:0%
report where I get all of the state's
ratings

05:35:52.550 --> 05:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
ratings
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the distribution moving
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
on distribution I can't even say the
 
05:35:59.890 --> 05:35:59.900 align:start position:0%
word it must be too tired
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
so uh distribution to municipalities
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
there we go yeah so this is just the uh
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the the amount that is is housed in our
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
budget and this is the meal syntax
 
05:36:12.530 --> 05:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
distribution as you all know the formula
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
changed during the last biennium in
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so so that you can see that the the
 
05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
the money going to the municipalities
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
has increased
 
05:36:25.490 --> 05:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
um it even increased
 
05:36:25.500 --> 05:36:26.270 align:start position:0%
um it even increased
um

05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:30.010 --> 05:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
six increase even more and
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
23 because because of the the way the
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
formula is written the way the statue is
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
written it just it just gives them more
 
05:36:40.260 --> 05:36:41.030 align:start position:0%
written it just it just gives them more
um

05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
it gives them it gives them less than 20
 
05:36:45.410 --> 05:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
50 or 22 and then begin in physical
 
05:36:45.420 --> 05:36:47.090 align:start position:0%
50 or 22 and then begin in physical
security

05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
um the way again the way the statue is
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
written it just it just
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
the funding is higher but then it stays
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
about the same going forward let's see
 
05:36:57.650 --> 05:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
what's 16
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I see your note here it says that the
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
governor is suspending
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:12.490 --> 05:37:12.500 align:start position:0%
Stacks distribution that's that's stay
 
05:37:16.368 --> 05:37:16.378 align:start position:0%
and that is now funded with a dedicated
 
05:37:16.378 --> 05:37:17.690 align:start position:0%
and that is now funded with a dedicated
fund

05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:37:17.700 --> 05:37:19.430 align:start position:0%
fund
um

05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:22.730 --> 05:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
that was maintained so that was
 
05:37:27.410 --> 05:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
um continue to be lost here 166.
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so yes so and so the governor did
 
05:37:33.288 --> 05:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
include the amount that we calculated
 
05:37:38.770 --> 05:37:38.780 align:start position:0%
and this calculation for fiscal year 24
 
05:37:42.670 --> 05:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
in 25 included
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
we obtained information from the
 
05:37:46.610 --> 05:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration and
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
the the to determine how their estimates
 
05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
on the meals and room stacks and we just
 
05:37:55.550 --> 05:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
built into this formula a two percent
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth the same as two percent
 
05:37:59.760 --> 05:38:00.948 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth the same as two percent
um

05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:03.890 --> 05:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
expense growth because the
 
05:38:07.368 --> 05:38:07.378 align:start position:0%
as part of the formula the the the
 
05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
cost to administer the the meals and
 
05:38:12.288 --> 05:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
room Stacks program
 
05:38:13.788 --> 05:38:13.798 align:start position:0%
um they can deduct that from that
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
calculation so we just included the two
 
05:38:18.170 --> 05:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
percent assumption for both revenue and
 
05:38:21.890 --> 05:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
expense growth assumption and that is
 
05:38:26.570 --> 05:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
um the 121 million and 24 and 123
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
million and 25 is what the formula
 
05:38:29.280 --> 05:38:31.250 align:start position:0%
million and 25 is what the formula
calculates

05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
calculates
 
05:38:31.260 --> 05:38:32.330 align:start position:0%
calculates
um

05:38:32.330 --> 05:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
the the what what what the governor
 
05:38:38.330 --> 05:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
removed was uh the state of Revenue
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
sharing this is an amount that's still
 
05:38:40.740 --> 05:38:43.070 align:start position:0%
sharing this is an amount that's still
this

05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
this um I guess mandate is still in
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
statute so we have to budget at every
 
05:38:52.610 --> 05:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
time but one more time the governor is
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
suspending the law and House Bill too I
 
05:38:57.770 --> 05:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
have not seen the the the language but I
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
was told that it will it will not be
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
part of our budget well it's not in the
 
05:39:04.490 --> 05:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
budget so it was removed
 
05:39:06.530 --> 05:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
so that's what that
 
05:39:06.540 --> 05:39:11.810 align:start position:0%
so that's what that
representative

05:39:11.810 --> 05:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
the state of Revenue sharing so many
 
05:39:16.368 --> 05:39:16.378 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:39:21.770 --> 05:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the Year this this the state used to
 
05:39:29.330 --> 05:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
pay 25 million dollars to municipality
 
05:39:29.340 --> 05:39:31.128 align:start position:0%
pay 25 million dollars to municipality
municipalities

05:39:31.128 --> 05:39:31.138 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
and but that that amount has been
 
05:39:37.788 --> 05:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
suspended over the last biennium like
 
05:39:39.948 --> 05:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
probably last 10 bienna
 
05:39:39.958 --> 05:39:43.550 align:start position:0%
probably last 10 bienna
and

05:39:43.550 --> 05:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:46.010 --> 05:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
correct that's the second that's the
 
05:39:48.170 --> 05:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
second amount that in the past
 
05:39:50.090 --> 05:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities used to get from the
 
05:39:54.410 --> 05:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
state they both part of our budget but
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms again this year was
 
05:40:00.288 --> 05:40:00.298 align:start position:0%
funded in the past it was capped for
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
upper to a particular amount but then
 
05:40:04.730 --> 05:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
when this formula was
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
during the last biennium the formula and
 
05:40:10.490 --> 05:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
the law was Rewritten and so it's been
 
05:40:12.530 --> 05:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
fun it has been been funded has been
 
05:40:14.570 --> 05:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
funded since then but the revenue
 
05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
sharing amount and we included 25
 
05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
million our agency budget but that was
 
05:40:19.378 --> 05:40:20.330 align:start position:0%
million our agency budget but that was
again

05:40:20.330 --> 05:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
so if we change the suspension to a
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
repeal it would make your life easier
 
05:40:34.970 --> 05:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
because in your agency budget you would
 
05:40:36.890 --> 05:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
never have to think about this thing
 
05:40:38.570 --> 05:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
that that is correct right that is
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
correct because you haven't we haven't
 
05:40:45.230 --> 05:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I think for municipalities hopes
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's that again
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's you know another item sitting in
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
my budget and so page a is just briefly
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
touching on
 
05:41:05.280 --> 05:41:06.550 align:start position:0%
touching on
um

05:41:06.550 --> 05:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
the college savings commission this is
 
05:41:11.810 --> 05:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
we renamed that activity code before it
 
05:41:16.850 --> 05:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
was called unique
 
05:41:16.860 --> 05:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
was called unique
um

05:41:17.750 --> 05:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not even checking around my house
 
05:41:21.410 --> 05:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
call exactly but so now it's called
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
College events uh commission it really
 
05:41:23.878 --> 05:41:24.890 align:start position:0%
College events uh commission it really
is

05:41:24.890 --> 05:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
um the portion of the budget that the
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
college Teresa Savings Plan advisor
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
commission it includes that
 
05:41:33.890 --> 05:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
administration of that commission we so
 
05:41:35.810 --> 05:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
we provide administrative support to
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
that commission and what is part of this
 
05:41:43.128 --> 05:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
um this accounting unit is
 
05:41:46.970 --> 05:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
um the the scholarship funds that flow
 
05:41:49.368 --> 05:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
through our budget essentially the money
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
comes from the what we call the New
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire excellence and higher
 
05:41:57.530 --> 05:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is kept separate
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
but in order to because it's much easier
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
to send payments to universities through
 
05:42:06.830 --> 05:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
the accounting system we use this part
 
05:42:09.948 --> 05:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
of our budget to essentially facilitate
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
those payments so that's what's been
 
05:42:15.170 --> 05:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
used since this I guess scholarships
 
05:42:17.810 --> 05:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
were created in 2006 and so that's
 
05:42:19.730 --> 05:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
what's holding that's what's part of
 
05:42:23.090 --> 05:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
this commission the the other item here
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
is the governor scholarship fund now
 
05:42:28.868 --> 05:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
that fund is funded with General funds
 
05:42:32.448 --> 05:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
that is a program that came to the
 
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
advisor commission a couple biennia ago
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
is part of our budget last year this
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
last biennium this program wasn't funded
 
05:42:47.810 --> 05:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
it or the I think the house the house
 
05:42:49.970 --> 05:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
removed we requested the money the house
 
05:42:52.010 --> 05:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
removed it from the budget
 
05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh it was around the Senate phase that
 
05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
it was decided that funding was going to
 
05:42:59.570 --> 05:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
be given and that funding was provided
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 2 so this program was
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
funded that way
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
this time around we the advisor
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
commission again approved to request
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
three million dollars for each fiscal
 
05:43:12.050 --> 05:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
year we included that in our budget and
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
the governor approved that so it was
 
05:43:16.368 --> 05:43:16.378 align:start position:0%
three million for we requested three
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
million for each biennium now going back
 
05:43:20.810 --> 05:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
to what commissioner Goulet was saying
 
05:43:23.030 --> 05:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
that there's some inconsistencies the
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
month so the money that was because we
 
05:43:29.330 --> 05:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
included the governor scholarship budget
 
05:43:33.230 --> 05:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
and the priority prioritize needs
 
05:43:35.208 --> 05:43:35.218 align:start position:0%
and I don't fully understand how it
 
05:43:39.050 --> 05:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
happened but the DUI T portion
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
um the class that was funding the doit
 
05:43:43.730 --> 05:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
amount which again those those costs
 
05:43:46.250 --> 05:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
came from the uit for us to put in our
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
budget for some reason that didn't make
 
05:43:48.120 --> 05:43:49.310 align:start position:0%
budget for some reason that didn't make
it

05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:43:52.250 --> 05:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
um everything else made it but not the
 
05:43:55.128 --> 05:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
portion that we asked for DRT so we
 
05:43:56.750 --> 05:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
would like
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
to ask as if with those those small
 
05:44:02.930 --> 05:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
dollars get put back into the budget so
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's what we are including I'm
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
including here in page on page eight we
 
05:44:08.930 --> 05:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
requested six thousand a hundred and
 
05:44:10.570 --> 05:44:10.580 align:start position:0%
eighty two dollars for fiscal year 24
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
and 6 357 fiscal year 25. and again
 
05:44:19.368 --> 05:44:19.378 align:start position:0%
somehow they got removed and
 
05:44:21.170 --> 05:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
um but we included that and again that's
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the piece needed for to fund the uit
 
05:44:23.280 --> 05:44:26.868 align:start position:0%
the piece needed for to fund the uit
expenses

05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the last two pieces as
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
um we also have a um this Ben Thompson
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund expenditure that is just an
 
05:44:38.208 --> 05:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
amount that we transfer to the
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
university system in New Hampshire from
 
05:44:42.830 --> 05:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
the come from this trust fund and the
 
05:44:45.288 --> 05:44:45.298 align:start position:0%
other two are the l-chip program and the
 
05:44:47.810 --> 05:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
Community Development proc block grant
 
05:44:50.570 --> 05:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
those are also past programs they just
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
housed in my budget and the treasures
 
05:44:55.490 --> 05:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
budget the l-chip
 
05:44:57.530 --> 05:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
and collaboration with the ill-chip
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
authority their requested five million
 
05:45:01.970 --> 05:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
dollars and so we included five million
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and the Community Development
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
Authority asked for 200 000 and that's
 
05:45:10.250 --> 05:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
what we include in our project
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have for presentation
 
05:45:14.090 --> 05:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any other
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
05:45:18.650 --> 05:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent people
 
05:45:29.770 --> 05:45:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
my plan if all goes well I'll issue it
 
05:45:35.448 --> 05:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
sometimes next week so you you I can
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly send it to the entire
 
05:45:39.708 --> 05:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
um division we typically send it to the
 
05:45:42.410 --> 05:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
chairman or chairs but I can certainly
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
to ever send it to everybody else
 
05:45:45.298 --> 05:45:47.150 align:start position:0%
to ever send it to everybody else
absolutely

05:45:47.150 --> 05:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
05:45:51.650 --> 05:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
should the could the Corpus of this
 
05:45:53.208 --> 05:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
trust fund be transferred to the
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
universities of endowment and then they
 
05:45:55.558 --> 05:45:56.690 align:start position:0%
universities of endowment and then they
could

05:45:56.690 --> 05:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:45:59.208 --> 05:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
pay themselves from it that that's a
 
05:46:00.650 --> 05:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
great question we've had discussions
 
05:46:03.770 --> 05:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
over time about that so what I
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
understood from a department of justice
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:06.730 align:start position:0%
understood from a department of justice
is

05:46:06.730 --> 05:46:06.740 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:10.970 --> 05:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
they could work with us the division of
 
05:46:13.610 --> 05:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
charitable trust they could work with us
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
to change
 
05:46:17.750 --> 05:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose they need they can go to
 
05:46:19.970 --> 05:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
court on our behalf and we could they
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
could be this there's a possibility to
 
05:46:24.170 --> 05:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
do that and just simply give them the
 
05:46:26.090 --> 05:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
entire trust because they are the
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of it so it could be
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
possible to do something like that we
 
05:46:31.730 --> 05:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
just have to engage and do work with
 
05:46:36.170 --> 05:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
it is worthwhile as it is in my long
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
very long list of things to do but yes
 
05:46:42.298 --> 05:46:45.650 align:start position:0%
very long list of things to do but yes
yes

05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I I believe it has nothing to do with
 
05:46:50.810 --> 05:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
a bill I believe it's just uh the
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
department adjuster will have to just
 
05:46:56.330 --> 05:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
um submit a request to the court to
 
05:46:58.368 --> 05:46:58.378 align:start position:0%
change the purpose of the trust this all
 
05:47:00.170 --> 05:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
is separate then
 
05:47:02.690 --> 05:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
um than legislation
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we check with representative Weiler
 
05:47:06.110 --> 05:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
the two of us have served on the
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission for years I stepped aside to
 
05:47:11.208 --> 05:47:11.218 align:start position:0%
let Margie Smith take the position but
 
05:47:13.970 --> 05:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
it has been debated she comes to the
 
05:47:15.890 --> 05:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
commission every quarter
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
to let us know what's going on but what
 
05:47:19.850 --> 05:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
do we had by 19 million dollars we gave
 
05:47:22.868 --> 05:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
out last year or something towards uh
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
scholarships and those are different
 
05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is the difference
 
05:47:30.170 --> 05:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
30 percent of my wire was speaking about
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
the Ben Thompson trust fund oh that's
 
05:47:34.190 --> 05:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
still above then I'm sorry I'm not
 
05:47:36.048 --> 05:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
paying attention that's okay and I I
 
05:47:37.788 --> 05:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
don't really have I don't really have
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
how much money we have in that trust
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
fund I can I can get that number for you
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
but what we transfer to the university
 
05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
system is this small amount and it comes
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
from a very old law in the 1900s that
 
05:47:54.610 --> 05:47:54.620 align:start position:0%
um when the state
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
misspent the funds and it was added to
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
the law that we needed to pay them on a
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis so we still do that
 
05:48:01.860 --> 05:48:02.448 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis so we still do that
um

05:48:02.448 --> 05:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.650 --> 05:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
my apologies I was still up on the
 
05:48:12.530 --> 05:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
commission reading through so yes and
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.288 --> 05:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
