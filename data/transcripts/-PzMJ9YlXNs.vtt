00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
um like to turn the subcommittee's
 
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
attention to Amendment um 0981 H which
 
00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 align:start position:0%
is the one that was just passed around
 
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
this was the official language that we
 
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
talked about the last time we met on
 
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
this bill did have an opportunity to
 
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
look into the one concern that I had
 
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned and it's fine so um I I feel
 
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that um so once again
 
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
line 12 C um just defines station Weare
 
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh which wasn't defined before hi
 
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
Peter um which wasn't defined
 
00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
before um makes the um requirement that
 
00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer tells us whether or not
 
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
past is in the material later on um and
 
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
then on the back side uh one thing that
 
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
was was changed from what we talked
 
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
about on page two line nine uh that
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph should a safe alternative to
 
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
the current firefighting personel
 
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
protective equipment be designed and
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured fire departments may give
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
preference to that it was should but
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
nobody really cares all that much that
 
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
I've talked to out here um because
 
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
really the meat of the bill is below
 
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
that um in sections six beginning
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2025 uh fire department
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
shall not provide as an option the
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing of that station Fireware and
 
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 align:start position:0%
then um on July 1st 2025 fire department
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
shall not provide as an option the
 
00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
wearing of the same so that just um
 
00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
addresses a representative Le's concern
 
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
about downshifting cost it gives them
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
time to get their allowance and then
 
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
time to go out and make the purchase um
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
so that they can transition away from uh
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
the PC lated stuff to safer Alternatives
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
so that once again was just kind of the
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
synopsis on the amendment that we talked
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
about last time we just didn't have it
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
officially so subcommittee wants to just
 
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
take a couple minutes to look at it or
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
if you feel comfortable with it you can
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
know okay
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
this this is the language we've we've
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
been talking about so so it's just a
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
question of having it physically so now
 
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
we can vote on it yeah and of course we
 
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
got some people here this morning I look
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%

have not been here before maybe mostly
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 align:start position:0%

Ed hi nice to be
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
back um so uh when we had the original
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it we didn't really go
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
into any form of detail on the amendment
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
that uh you were presenting if I
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
remember correctly um so I just kind of
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you the opportunity to
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
kind of present that Amendment and give
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
us the highlights as you see them and so
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
we were trying to
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
include more emergency
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
responders um one of the groups I was
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
looking at is the emergency room
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
Personnel in hospitals as we they've
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
requested our services quite a bit
 
00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
lately and when we were doing that we
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
did decided to go with the
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
definition that the feds use for
 
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
emergency responders cuz they kind of
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
change it from time to time add delete
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
so that way we wouldn't have to keep
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
coming back to this to change it to add
 
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.350 align:start position:0%
coming back to this to change it to add
or

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
delete we can just float along with
 
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
them is what we were looking to do uh
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
real quickly represent a so where is
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
that found if you want to attach it to
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
the federal definition so in the
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
minute if you give us a page in line
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
number that'd be
 
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
number that'd be
helpful

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%

state um so we're very fortunate to have
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
this time with you and and happy to
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
answer all these questions um what Mr PR
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
if I can draw your attention to line 20
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh which page sorry on the second page
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
okay um is where we start to talk about
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
the addition of Emergency Department
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel um it's it's important that we
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
Define that as representative CR said um
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking for you we do that
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
um and we utilize the language if if we
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
could just clarify on the copy that we
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
have line 20 you said on page two just
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
says state city town or private
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services level sorry 21 okay
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're the hospital emergency Personnel
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
yep so that is where we start to define
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
those additional individuals that we're
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
looking to support um as representative
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
pu said that's come from a direct
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
request from the hospitals for that
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
support sure uh the men and women in
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
those departments see what we bring in
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
trauma and Devastation to them on a
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
daily basis um and they're left to try
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
to help not only law enforcement put the
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
pieces back together but the men and
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
women in the communities that we serve
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're serving our families as well um
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
and when we bring them those individuals
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
expose them to critical incidents
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
they're often Lo left unsupported um and
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
that is one of the genuine intent of the
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
this change is to make sure that those
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
folks have the support that they need
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
after they're exposed to that trauma
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay one of the bigger one of the other
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
aspects that we were hoping to to
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
utilize to bolster the statute um was to
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
help address the underserved retired
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
population of the law enforcement
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
Community um I don't know how much
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
historical knowledge you gentlemen have
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
of this statute but we were fortunate in
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to have it
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
2013 um this has been a tool that we
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
have utilized across the state in all
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
assets of first the first responder
 
00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:10.839 align:start position:0%
Community to really break down the
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
stigma and barriers that exist to
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
accessing appropriate culturally
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
competent mental health support services
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
across the state um when we wrote the
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
statute one of the biggest oversights
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
was the need to not only retain our
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
retired Personnel on our teams but also
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure sure that our retired
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel had access to support services
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
well after they left our profession um
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen might have heard a lot of
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk throughout the state house this
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
year about the Recruitment and Retention
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
issues amongst the first responder
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
Community um and but being able to
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
retain our retired members on our teams
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
as well as provide services to them will
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely be a tool that we can utilize
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate some of those
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issues
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
question on that one so page two line 28
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
I see where the retired where we add
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
retired to members of the critical
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team yes sir
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
where are we adding the
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
services so in that those Services
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
provided to retirees would come in um
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
under any individuals receiving services
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
so we have bolstered that section it it
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
already stated that the individuals
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
receiving Services uh were confidential
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
and protected by the confidentiality
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
statute as well um but we further
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
expanded that with a more clearly uh
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
outlined uh definition or not definition
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
but more clearly outlined language sure
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
where where is that um what page and
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
line number so we can take a look at for
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
one moment sir yep no rush so that is
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to be on page three and it starts
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
person okay so you're looking to nor any
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
person to include retired people correct
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
sir you didn't want to specify that more
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
clearly because we can I mean we have
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
time to make changes if if the
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee feels that that would help
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
answer any and all doubt or speculation
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the future I absolutely think now is
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
the time to do that yeah well I'll make
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
a note of it anyway so we can discuss
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah Peter did you want to say something
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman so going
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
back to page two
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
uh I have a an issue with the fact that
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
line 22 said while in the hospital
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
emergency department
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
so uh how about if they're outside uh or
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
they get called out somehow it seems to
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
me that the the while in is is not the
 
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.350 align:start position:0%
me that the the while in is is not the
central

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
central
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
aspect uh the the thing is are they are
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
they attached to the hospital emergency
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
department that's that's their
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
employment that's their uh that that's
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
their assignment and so forth whether
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
they're actually physically in the
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
department I think I think is irrelevant
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
if that that's their normal place and
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
they are attached to the hospital and
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
emergency department either full-time or
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
part-time or whatever and and so if
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
they're if they're away called out uh
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
across a block across the street
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they are part of the it's the
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
fact that that that they're exposed to
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
this type of uh work environment that is
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
so stressful that so that's and and I'm
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
okay with expanding that but yeah before
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
before your answer representative just
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
want a clarification sorry um yeah I
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
think the difficulty um representative
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
Schmidt in this from my perspective is
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking to make sure that anybody
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
who's in the space when it happens has
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
access to the care they may or may not
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
be an actual employee correct well we
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
could have like a respiratory Tech come
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
down from the floor X-ray tech come in
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
right so they're in that space that's
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
not their
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
official uh area to work is the
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
emergency room it it's just they come
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a big emergency so you
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
could get a nurse from the uh ICU come
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
down to help them so if they're in that
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
space working um that's fine but I also
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
see representative Schmidt's um idea is
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll take a a nurse from
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
the emergency department stick them in
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
the ambulance for a critical
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
transport to another hospital or
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
something like that right but I would
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
think that because they came up out of
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency room with that patient
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
they should be covered but you know well
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
but you're you're also raising a
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
complete different point and that is you
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
got somebody who is not ordinarily
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
attached to the emergency department but
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
that day they're there and they're
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
exposed to that traumatic
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
experience and maybe it's only one time
 
00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:50.590 align:start position:0%
experience and maybe it's only one time
thing

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
but if it's bad enough one time is
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
enough you're in there and you're seeing
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
something God awful then you've been
 
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
something God awful then you've been
traumatized

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
traumatized
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
so I you're you're covering something of
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
a different aspect but I think both
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
things are equally valid that was the
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
point that I was turning to out I think
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
you got to be careful what you do with
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
the language because you don't want to
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
negate the one by adding the other
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
representative boy did you want to say
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
something thought is exposure I mean you
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
could have civilian Personnel that
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
happen to be in there with one of their
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
family members and they have to see this
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
right as they're being rolled into the
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
and and and of course the other
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
component to this that I think we'll
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
have to keep in mind and try to keep
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
balance whatever we decide to do in work
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
on is this is a peer support network as
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
well correct so I mean you you aren't
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
licensed in the same way as a licensed
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
mental health professional right so we
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
got be a little careful we have specific
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
training and and we have to be trained
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
to fit into this guideline right so I
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
mean the family member may not fit into
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
this because they're not a here there is
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
a actually a a a debar team that does
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
civilians and that's their job and
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're run by the state and we refer
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
them to that or the mental health
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
catchment in their area okay that's good
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
to know any other questions at this
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
point all right if you want to continue
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
and and just for some clarification for
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt um we we hope our
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
genuine intent of covering all those
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
people is very clearly defined uh on
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
page two line 21 uh under sub paragraph
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
number I uh is where it says Hospital
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
Emergency Department Personnel means
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
staff rendering care so the genuine
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
intent there is to capture all of those
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that you're concerned about
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
um and so I I do hope that we adequately
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
address that for you in that language
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
well we do but but I mean representative
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
pu has has pointed out why it says while
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
in because if they're there whether
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're ordinarily attached to but if
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're there in that on that day at
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
that time and expose that
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
trauma yes sir then we need to we need
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
to protect them
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
too thank you any other things that
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
you'd like to highlight from the bill
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to at some point too go
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
kind of through line by line and just
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
address a couple of thoughts I had but
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah absolutely I just will before we
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
move on I would like to make sure to
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
fully answer your question is that we
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
are it is correct we are not licensed
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
but we are trained peer supporters and
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
certified by the international critical
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
incident Foundation to offer these
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
Services the delivery the supports that
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're offering are not clinical in
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
nature we are trained to recognize the
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
normal reactions to stress and Trauma
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
we're trained to educate our peers on
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
what those are normalize those reactions
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
and the biggest component of our peer
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
support network is to make sure that
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
we're able to refer out to culturally
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
competent licensed providers when those
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
needs arise we are genuinely the bridge
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
to those support services that are
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
usually very difficult for our Personnel
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
to access because of the stigma that
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
surrounds First Responders reaching out
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
for help so our genuine mission is to
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we break down those
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
barriers and we are able to connect our
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
peers to those licensed providers to get
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
the support that they need right my main
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
concern was because it is peer driven is
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
there liability if you step outside the
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
scope in some way so if we've gone
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
beyond peer to somebody else are you at
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
all liable for offering services to
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
somebody who according to the um what
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
was it the IC ISF um ICF yeah that um
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
has basically so given us your scope of
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
practice for lack of a better way of
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
putting it scope of practice but it's
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
also the train if you could use the mic
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
represent sorry sorry it's also the
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
training right if if you stay in that
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
model you should be somewhat protected
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
what happens is the confidentiality
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
falls off if it's not one of those
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
gotcha members okay so and that's what
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is to make sure we can
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
provide services to to the people Mo and
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
we only really seek out First Responders
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
right um but they come in many sizes and
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
shapes ski patrol the mountain rescue
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
people uh wide area sometimes you you
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
think oh yeah I all forgot all about
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
those guys um but we want to make sure
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
we have that confidentiality right
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
because like he said the stigma is still
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
there right and we want to make sure uh
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
and not maybe not so much in the Fire
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
EMS side but I know on the police side
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's always been a concern
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
that if my boss finds out what will
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
happen to my job right and more and more
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
that stigma and that whole thing is
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
going away but it's still in the back of
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of Minds so they want want to be
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
sure that when they seek these Services
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
what set in the room stays in the room
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
right so and that's what we're trying to
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
make sure happens is
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
come in confidence know that what said
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
in the room stays in the room and and
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
and when they we send them off to uh a
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
mental health professional that follows
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
them right so that's our big thing about
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.549 align:start position:0%
them right so that's our big thing about
this

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay for members of the committee is
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
everybody pretty
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
well um feel comfortable with the intent
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
of the material what we're trying to
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish all right so having said that
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think we we get the concept and I
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
think for the most part it seems like
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much in support of the
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
concept um just like to get into the
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
specifics of the actual Amendment which
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
would become law to make sure that we
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing and what we're
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
recommending and um so if I may on page
 
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.590 align:start position:0%
recommending and um so if I may on page
one

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
line8 um
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
we start to see the term so we've we've
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
crossed out emergency service provider
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of response to the incident
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we've replaced it with emergency
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
response SLU safety worker we're going
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
to use that several times um so that
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
term I see that it's used and and the
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
meaning of it can be inferred at the top
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
of page two in that first paragraph par
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph F the meaning of that term can
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
be inferred from there is that defined
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere in statute though or should we
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
be defining that and statute because
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's referenced so much in this if
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
then thank you sir very good question so
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
that title uh came from a direct result
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
of our commission to study incidents of
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
PTSD amongst First Responders uh there
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
is a sub there's a committee that's
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
formed legislatively mandated and in
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
place where there are representatives
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
from the first responder community that
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
come together on a monthly basis to look
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
into how we can better support our First
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
Responders there's members of your
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on that that panel with us
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
um we worked very hard to create some
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
additional supports um for families and
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
survivors of suicide um and that term
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
and definition comes directly from some
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
work that we did within the workers
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
compensation statute which is
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
281a um and so that title comes
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
specifically from that language to make
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the definition of First
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
Responders is accurate accurately
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
represented throughout statutes across
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
the state uh I think it's important to
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we meet nearer existing
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
language in other places and so the
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
language proposal that you see there is
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
a means to try to clean up our statutes
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
across the board when it comes to
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with issues revolving around
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
First Responders okay
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
281 so
 
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.389 align:start position:0%
281 so
281a

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
281a
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
correct believe that's the worker
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
workers compens that's workers
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
compensation yes sir so do you know what
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
part underneath
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
that really testing my memory sir I've
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
got the list if you want to look at it
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
17 maybe I've got the list if you want
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yep incident y 17 incident of
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress so that that's our
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's our peer support statute so RSA
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
281 d a semic 177e and then a VC is
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
where emergency response and Public
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.269 align:start position:0%
 
defined

00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:56.669 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes so if you follow on on page two one
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
one second I'm so sorry so 281 a17 and
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
then you said Roman numeral 5 nope sir
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
so uh 281a yeah two and it falls under
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:43.789 align:start position:0%
 
C2

00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
when did you put it that was done in
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
last legislative session maybe
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
it's that could be the I was like
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's not one here if I take this not
 
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
there's not one here if I take this not
at

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
all just not up yeah be next oh okay I'm
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
not going crazy it's just not there yet
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
all right so um emergency response
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
Public Safety worker means call
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer or regular firefighters law
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer certified under RSA
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
106l certified County Corrections
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
Officers emergency communication
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
dispatchers and rescue or ambulance
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
workers including Ambulance Service
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
emergency medical personnel first
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
responder service and um volunteer
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
personnel and that matches
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
what you did in on page two in the first
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
paragraph Y and you you see that we
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
added uh hospital emergency personel uh
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
Corrections Sheriff's um deputy sheriff
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
State Police civilian law enforcement
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
civilian County
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections and then it goes into the
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer reg okay so I mean and the
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee can jump in
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
if you have thoughts on this um if
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to use this and you want to
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
keep it consistent then shouldn't we
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
either amend RSA 281 to include these
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
things or so the one issue with doing
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
that is you're going to a if you're
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
going to look to add the emergency um
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital staff to that you're going to
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
open up the whole workers comp statute
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
to adding those people and including
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
those people within those benefits um
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
because that's where that that's what
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
that statute specifically addresses the
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
the compensation and support that's
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
available to those First Responders uh
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
during workers comp claims so that would
 
00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
be I believe a whole another discussion
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
of whether or not those people are
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
eligible those individuals are eligible
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
for those supports through that statute
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
it seemed a little bit out of the scope
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
of what we were trying to yeah no I I
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
agree with you the concern that I have
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
primarily is you said that you wanted to
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
keep it for consistency across the rsas
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
but this isn't going to be consistent
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
across the rsas because you're Chang
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
if if we keep this as the standard which
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's not really L it's not in this
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas right s workman's
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
compensation in the rsas um you're
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
including more people than just the
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
people in the emergency response Public
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
Safety worker over here so my my concern
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
is and my question is should we be
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
putting a definition into this
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
section that defines emergency response
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
Public Safety worker and includes the
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
people that you want it to include so in
 
00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.669 align:start position:0%
people that you want it to include so in
that

00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
commission it was all about a lot of it
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
was about work workman's comp they had
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh people for primax and labor and stuff
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
so for whatever reason they didn't want
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
to include them in that section in the
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
workers comp but we want to include them
 
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.190 align:start position:0%
workers comp but we want to include them
in

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
on top of that right and my question is
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
and Peter you might you might know
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
better than I should dur instead of
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
doing it here in the first paragraph on
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
page two when we're dealing with
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
definitions on page one should we have a
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
definition section that says emergency
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
response Public Safety worker for the
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
purposes of this
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision um emergency response Public
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
Safety worker shall include any law
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer roll them out so
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
that it's defined in the statute and
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
then when we get to paragraph two or
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph one on page two you don't have
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
to list them again you can just refer to
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
the definition that we've already laid
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
out and that way if it comes up again
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
you can just refer back to the
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
definition because as it stands at this
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
point if you want to make change in the
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
future or something else happened you're
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
going to have to go back and change
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
every other place that listed change the
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
definition next time does that make
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
sense to people okay sure because it's
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
not it's not the same as you have it
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
listed so you want to take that
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph and pretty much make it a
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
definition I want to I want to take that
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
paragraph make it a definition in the
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
first section under definitions and then
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
when you get to this section you can
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
literally just say critical incident
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
stress management team member oh and by
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the way is that supposed to be team
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
member or team
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
member on online one team members twice
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
is it supposed to be there twice it
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it is
 
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it is
oh

00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
yeah strike one of those so plur team
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
member or team members plural okay make
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
it team members okay fix
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
that um so yeah the paragraph would say
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress management team
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
member or team members
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
means um an emergency response Public
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
Safety worker specially trained to
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
provide critical incident stress
 
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519 align:start position:0%
management and crisis intervention
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
services as a member of an organized
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
sense yes sir that that does make sense
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay especially if we clearly Define
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
that on page one and this is essentially
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the definition that you're looking for
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir okay very good anything
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you Mr chairman so it
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that uh that we're getting
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
into a situation where we've got this is
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
all useful I'm not uh you know trying to
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
downgrade it whatsoever but what we're
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
doing is we're creating a
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
category that's got that's got a a long
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
T tail right so and and these people are
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
in that category do we want to create
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of an acronym because
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise we've got half a paragraph
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
Just defining the people or naming the
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
people I should say def definition is
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
important because everybody and these
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
people are they're regular members so
 
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.149 align:start position:0%
people are they're regular members so
there

00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
are acronyms out there like EMT we don't
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
have to say emergeny management we know
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
EMT it's a Trope it's a so once once we
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
Define this on page one then we can just
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
use critical
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
cism team member okay it's just I'm
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
raising the issue because to the degree
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
that we have a long
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
Y and it becomes awkward because and I
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
think unfortunately it has to be a long
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
tail because if you don't Define them
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
then somebody will come along and say
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
covered they don't get the
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality they don't get the
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
services and if you gave them Services
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
now we can hear what we have to know
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
what they said and and we can compel you
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
I I I I I get it and I'm not quarreling
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
with that at all the thing is if you got
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
it's just like this committee is called
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
Edna because otherwise if we said
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
executive departments an administration
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
every time we'd be halfway through the
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
day before we got the name of the
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
committee out there my family still have
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
we got something that we
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
can right abbreviate cism team member
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay even that is a bunch of words
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
team member no no that's too few what
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for is an acronym because
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
then you've got something that becomes
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
people think this person is
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
a CSM I'm only raising the issue I'm not
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
saying I can't support this because
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
here give that some thought guys
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
um okay so so that would take care of my
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
first concern what was making sure that
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
that was defined so that we had a a
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
workable definition for what exactly it
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
thought and other people can take the
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
mic if they'd like to share I mean you
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
guys can switch out a little bit you
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
know absolutely so I
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
think instead ofstead of second person
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
we can get it first person we just
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify to get back to where
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
the some of the initial language came
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
from which might help explain why we
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
were trying to mirror the existing
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
language into yeah know I understand the
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
the it's good to mirror the language I
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that you know
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're clearly defining what we're
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
yes good morning uh my name is Bill
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
ainson I'm the recently retired
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
assistant fire chief in NASA of good 38
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
37 years in the fire service um when we
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
were initially working on on this we
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
looked at uh uh Homeland Security and
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security's definition of first
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
responder and we kind of tossed that
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
around but we didn't want to necessarily
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
add a new definition in But to answer
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
U representative Simon or Matt whatever
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
um to answer your initial question of
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
where we got our you know where where
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
you could find the definition uh
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
according the federal uh um federal law
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
6 USC 101 colon 6 can can slow that down
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
and give it to me again the law is
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
enacted by Congress from 2002 to
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
president it's it's
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
defined yeah the the actual number the
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
federal number six
 
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.430 align:start position:0%
federal number six
USC

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
USC
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
101 uh colon 6 okay great and that
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
basically is the defines emergency
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
response provider and that says that it
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
means federal state and local
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
governmental and non-governmental
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
emergency public safety fire law
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement emergency response emergency
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
medical including hospital emergency
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and related Personnel
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
agencies and authorities okay so that's
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
the federal uh when Homeland Security
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
was formed they came up with a
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
definition that also uh applies it goes
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
into other agencies but basically
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security said this is the
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
definition that we're going to use to
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
define emergency response providers and
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
have we gone outside of that definition
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
here are there more people involved than
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
are in that definition this definition
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
is is a very Global definition and I
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
think we and here in New Hampshire we're
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of tighten that up a
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
little bit okay because confidentiality
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
is pretty much what drives everything
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we do yeah uh as far as a peer
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
support team and members of a peer
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
support team so we were just trying to
 
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
be perhaps too specific but we want to
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we covered everyone that
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
may be uh to your point sir uh we want
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
to to cover everyone that may be
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
impacted by a traumatic event right uh
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarification purposes the
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
only reason why I asked was because
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
originally representative PR had
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned potentially wanting to attach
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
the definition to that um but that is
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
not exactly what we have in this bill
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
and so uh just from the preference so
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss it from the
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
preference of you guys um was the hope
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
to connect it actually in RSA to that
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
federal statute or do you want to stick
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
with the definition that you've come up
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
with I I think we stick with the
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
definition that we've come up with um I
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
was I'm just here trying to to answer
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
your specific question on where where we
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
sort of some more additional background
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
information yep perfect I appreciate it
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions from
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
no okay um are we good with the
 
00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:54.750 align:start position:0%
no okay um are we good with the
definition

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
component okay um so my next question
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
further down on page one uh starting in
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
line 22 that paragraph CR critical
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
incident stress management and crisis
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
intervention services means consultation
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
peer support we're striking counseling
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh debriefing diffusing intervention
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
services management prevention and
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
referral provided by a critical incident
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
Str stress management team and or team
 
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.030 align:start position:0%
Str stress management team and or team
member

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
um the question that I have is is it
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
necessary from your perspective to put
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
in team if a single team member is all
 
00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
in team if a single team member is all
that's

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
necessary so I I guess we provide like
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
two different kinds of service right you
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
have the pier oneon-one and we do
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
debriefings and diffusing which is a
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
team effort at least two to three people
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
go we sit in a room with 15 20 people
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
whoever were involved in the incident
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
and de brief them and then so it may be
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
a team thing but if you want to just
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
leave it as a team member that one team
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
member making
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
U the
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
referral no I actually know it's helpful
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
the reason why I asked the question is
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
to bring out I think what you did so the
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
debriefing and defusing those are two
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
things that would more likely be a team
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
there is a team that provides a service
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
and then there can be just one team
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
member that provid the service yeah let
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
me just I I'll think about that a little
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
bit as far as potential wording or
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it but it's probably not
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
life or death but I just wanted to know
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
why the differentiation between the two
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh we talked about the third
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
one that I had which was on line one um
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about the paragraph anything
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
else um on page two the addition of the
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency department personnel
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
before we move on from that one I think
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
so that's just them adding the
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
Department we we talked about exposure
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
and potentially trying to find some your
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
am well the amendment that I have here
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
yes it's actually represented PR's
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but 033 3H this is where you
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
had brought up your concerned about
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
other people who were outside of the
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
emergency department but we can have
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
that discussion and try to figure out
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
but just wanted to make sure there were
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
no more questions on those on that
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
particular phrase there before we move
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
on past
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
it I think we okay um next line 26 the
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
team shall be registered with the
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
icisf which we know who that is or a
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
similar organization which I know
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
frequently pops up in statute it's not
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
unheard of to put that language in it's
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit boilerplate um just curious
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
who that or who those other
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
organizations may be that might come
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
into play um and then it says to
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
maintain training standards to date as
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
required I'm assuming as required by
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
icisf yes yes and then
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um what H who who holds you accountable
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you do not hold those standards as
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
required does icisf handle it or do we
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
handle it who's holding you accountable
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
for not meeting those standards because
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
we're giving you the right in in statute
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
right to do this um so if the only
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
people overseeing you are icisf I just
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a question about that yeah it would
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
be the icisf and the and the director of
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
safety also helps oversee and I identify
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
any of those other uh training entities
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
or organizations that uh teams are
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to be trained by okay so
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
director of safety so if we threw
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
in potentially something about the
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
director of safety that would be
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
something that you're doing presently
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
correct okay um I just want to make sure
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we potentially have that in there
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
so that there is some someone having to
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
do with the state of New Hampshire that
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
um any anything from anybody else on
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
that particular section good all right
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh line 28 all critical incident stress
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
management team members sworn civilian
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
or retired we get the retired in there
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
um shall be designated by police chief
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%

superintendent of County Corrections
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
chief of Emergency Medical Services
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
director of the division of emergency
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
services and Communications or the head
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
of a union of Emergency Response Public
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
Safety workers as defined by RSA 281 A2
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
obviously some of those are already in
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
statute you're adding some um is this
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
Universal so if somebody if the
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.270 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
Corrections

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
um designates a critical incident stress
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
management team member can that team
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
member work across all disciplines or is
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
it specific to the Department of
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
Correction CS so they could provide
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
support services to all First Responders
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
Responders and from your experience
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with all of those
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
people making that call yes sir
 
00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:19.270 align:start position:0%
people making that call yes sir
okay

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
um okay so this I think we added my next
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
question which is anything from the
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee on page two before we go to
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay um I think we answered my next
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
question we added nor any person
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
receiving any critical in incident
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
stress management and Crisis
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
Intervention that was specifically for
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
retired people but is the scope intended
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be larger than that do you have
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else in mind other than retired
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
individuals not at this time sir okay I
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
do it may be something that we should
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
discuss especially if you already have
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
that question and we have the
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put it in there now it
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
may be very important to make sure it's
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
very clear that that is the population
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're intending to support there are the
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
retirees I agree with you on that yeah I
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
just don't I don't want to go out
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of what you're
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
looking for and accidentally add in
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
other people that we're not intending to
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
so this is specifically for retired
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
individuals to making sure that all of
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
all First Responders receiving services
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
are protected to include retirees yes
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
good anything else from the
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I I would almost leave it

any person receiving I hear any yeah
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
sorry you gotta talk I would leave it
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
any person receiving critical incident
 
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.069 align:start position:0%
any person receiving critical incident
stress

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
covered yeah I only because no I
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and I'm
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
not trying to like y create a problem in
 
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
not trying to like y create a problem in
there

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I like to hear actually
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
Mr user Hut's thoughts on it potentially
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
he might be helpful on this
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I'm not sure if that
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
Care after they're retired because
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're no longer appear at that point
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't defined
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
retirees or any person receiving
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
critical in stress
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
intervention we we'll work on it we'll
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
throw it back past you to make sure that
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
whatever if we change it you know it's
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
it's you're comfortable with it you
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't have any concerns that we're not
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of um uh but I just want to
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
make sure it's clear so that you know
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then um and then later on line five
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
you add disclosed which makes sense so
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
you're getting both the person providing
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
the service and receiving the service
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
involved there which makes sense to me
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
anyway um so that will lead us down to
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
line 13 and following um where we're
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
changing the definition slightly of um
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
what is deemed
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
confidential um or we committee
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving on to that
 
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.549 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving on to that
point

00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
okay um just walk us through why you
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
changed what you changed and what you're
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
hoping to it'll accomplish yeah
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely we're genuinely hoping that
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
the committee doesn't see it as a change
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
but more of a clarification okay um and
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're very clearly
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
defining for everybody uh when and how
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
we need to get our folks additional
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
Support Services when they need it um
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute we were concerned
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
and and other departments coming on
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
board with offering peer support
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
services was were also looking for some
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
clarification so that's why we really
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
leaned into um providing that Clarity to
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's truly understood
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
when somebody is a danger to thems or
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
somebody else and they not only
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
articulate a means but an intent that
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're able to get them help um when when
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
a crime has been committed or is about
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
to be committed we absolutely need to to
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
get an individual help to stop that from
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
happening or to prevent that from
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
happening um and then obviously when
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's ever a threat of violence or
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
danger or crime against the vulnerable a
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population our adults or
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me our juveniles or our elderly
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
that that's all information that we are
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
all as humans in the state of New
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mandated reporters and
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
required to get more assistance to for
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
those individuals to and report that
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
information to the appropriate entities
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
um so when we created the statute in
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
2013 we really wanted to make sure that
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
those things were very clear um but
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
since we have evolved and we are growing
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
we saw the need to make it a little bit
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
more clearer yeah so you're flushing it
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
out a little bit more adding adding a
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay gentlemen thank you very
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
much unless there's something else you
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
want to add I think that brings us to
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
the end and I want to give other people
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%

actually um at OS now and I told them
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
when I we were done today I would go
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
down and give them the last comment so
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
they can draft it up properly uh do you
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
have did you do you guys have one to
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
look at what are he's talking about yeah
 
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
look at what are he's talking about yeah
okay

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.430 align:start position:0%
okay
cool

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
cool
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh I was not here for the original
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
hearing because I zoned it and I was in
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
exec session at fishing game as the
 
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
clerk fortunately for me Daniel papovich
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
Miller was here as a
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor he said he goes to hearings
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
for billly co-sponsors so got to give
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
him credit for for being here to save
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
that so and I think originally uh uh the
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
chair said she might have thought there
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
was some feeling that the bill might not
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
be necessary and we can talk through
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
that with the gentleman here but I think
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
now that we've kind of gotten this far
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
that we're at a good place with thinking
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
that it's something that we should move
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
forward with so that kind of being where
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
it's at that um you have the the the the
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
version with the red lettering on is the
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you need to ask what
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
change I have it highlighted in the
 
01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:06.390 align:start position:0%
change I have it highlighted in the
original

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so you added the the one line
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%

added language I yes and I added that
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know attorney a house has
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
had the has had the time to really take
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
that in and he probably has a better
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
idea of how to say that I'm
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure since I did that at one o'clock
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
this morning yes well I have one from
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
you I've got one from him I've got stuff
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
all over the place for this one so we'll
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh we'll wait our way through and the
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee members can stop and ask
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
questions just yell at me if you got
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions and and actually I would I
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
would add to that from the original Bill
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
amendment with oplc a number of the
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
tasks that we gave to the veterans
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
agency was suggested that OPC should do
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
that which is why when you get to page
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
two of the original Bill most of it's
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
deleted and it's
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
now Incorporated in the amendment or
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's already in what oplc would do
 
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.150 align:start position:0%
it's already in what oplc would do
anyway

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and I I believe that
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative leus asked that question
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
during the original hearing about
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not oplc was doing some of
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
this or should be doing some of this or
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
I think he asked that question so that's
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
probably enough for me to start great
 
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.230 align:start position:0%
probably enough for me to start great
thank

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
you would you like to make some comments
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
on it gentlemen we we're getting it for
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
the first time so I haven't had time to
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
judgest it yet you
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
want you want me to good morning Doug
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
PLC for for the record
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
subit okay too formal I get it take my
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
tie off uh do you me to address the the
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
comment on line b or just kind of an
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
overall statement um overall statement
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
on it so that we can get an an idea of
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
where you are and then once we've done
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
that if you want to add in what you've
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
done and what you'd like to see in there
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
that would be great um so I think I
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
think overall what what we're going to
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
see the progress here is not necessarily
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a speed up of the processing
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
of the application on the opl side but
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
what we're going to see is a stream Ling
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
of kind of what comes before that so
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to clarify what is required
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
for lure in the state and how that you
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
know the military service and the
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
training and experience translate to the
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
licensing here and then what we're also
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
going to see with the VAP is uh licenses
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
coming to the oplc that are complete and
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
ready to go and they're ready to be
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
processed and when we have a complete
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
application I mean sometimes our
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
turnaround can be same day um and it's
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
going to be less than two weeks
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
regardless so we can we can turn a a a
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
complete a completed application around
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly so I think that's where
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to see the benefit from from
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
this statute is sort of everything that
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
predicates that application coming into
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
the oplc and when it comes in correctly
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
we get it right out the door and so I
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
see that that same changed language is
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
in this amendment on page two 30 days
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
after having received we don't have that
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
same language that we did before right
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
well that yeah I think my concern in in
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
1385 is originally proposed was it has
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
this language about 15 days 10 days and
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
then we would need to submit something
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
in writing and get approval if we have
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
to go and it it deviated so far from
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
541a and shortened shortened the leas a
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
little too much and I I it could have
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
been problematic I think the language in
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
the new bill kind of allows us more
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frames to turn this over
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I I think we're okay with just for
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees benefit
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
problematic from the standpoint if you
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
miss that deadline to reject the we
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
would have had no if it was an
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
incomplete or inaccurate application and
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't get approval timely from
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
another agency we would have been forced
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
to deny in my opinion and that makes
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
everybody start the process over so here
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
we just extend that timeline a little
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
bit longer and we're able to turn things
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
around without being put in that
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
situation where it's yes or no on the
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
spot mhm thank you yeah thanks keep
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
going anything
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
else uh are we going to talk more
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
specifically about the language as
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
specifically as you would like to talk
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
about like I haven't I haven't had a
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
chance yet so I can't be as specific as
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
I usually like to be sure I'm just
 
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
I usually like to be sure I'm just
reading

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
it okay uh the colonel is recommending
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh that I I addressed something right
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
out front uh representative Brown came
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
to was this morning and added a on the
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
last page of the document a section D it
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
says the rule shall be complete by XXXX
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
2025 yes you see that
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
I I understand the impotence behind that
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
right to make sure these happen it is a
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
little concerning because it's not
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily in our control and we have a
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
lot of stakeholders we're going to have
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
to work with in order to make this
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
happen um if we want that sort of that
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
so from the LLC perspective we're going
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
to start work on this and this is
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
something we want to have happen and
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to make it happen um
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
as much as we can um that hard timeline
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
is always scary from an attorney's point
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
of view right we miss that deadline
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
there's objections there's stakeholder
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
feedback we weren't expecting now we're
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with the law I'm
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if we
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
could my suggestion was potentially make
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
it file an IP or an initial proposal
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
that way we would still have that time
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
to work I we hadn't discussed that yet
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
no and so backing up a little bit in um
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
you have the original you have the law
 
01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.229 align:start position:0%
you have the original you have the law
there

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
332 so when that was passed and and I'm
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
I'm uh telling you what director
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
Courtney said to me so you're getting it
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
secondhand so take that as you may
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
um so the intent of this was to to to
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
basically have a crosswalk if you're
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
this in the military you should be able
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
to get this in New Hampshire whatever
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
that is doesn't matter could be
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
electrician could be a pharmacy tech we
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
went with medical initially but and
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
director Courtney said to me well we put
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
this in the law a little while ago that
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
all boards would have to do this in
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
rulem which is what it says in
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
there but she told me and you can you
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
can you know fix this up as as necessary
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
that most of them have either not
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
started at all or they're not done one
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
of one or the
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
both so yeah I'll just finish up so I I
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
I I have complete faith and the director
 
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
and and attorney have told me that they
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
will get to this immediately for all
 
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
boards under
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
oplc however those that aren't EMS so
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
again if you're a medic a Corman can you
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
be an EMT or an EMR crossover
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
apparently they haven't done those rules
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
yet um there's there are some already in
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
place where there's automatic crossover
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
so so putting D in was for me to try to
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
get those boards that haven't started
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
this off dead center basically so there
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
must there can be a better way to do
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
this it's fine so you're going outside
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
of oplc there you're doing all boards
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
regardless right does that include the
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
bar it would include include the bar
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
right now uh the the other issue with
 
01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
right now uh the the other issue with
that

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
is um where it's placed right now
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
is oh no this is under 541a
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it this looks like it's amending
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
31016 which is specifically limited to
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
boards is that is that I think well
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me my intent was on the bottom of
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
that second page under number four for
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
all of you on the bottom oh men 332 G
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay right and that'll be more clear I'm
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with that now I thought
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
that was actually put
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
in because this is the first I've seen
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
this version to okay um I see what
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying so cutc out there and
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're switching it over to to
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
anyone to any so yeah so OPC will will
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
take all the boards that they have under
 
01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
their purview but that leaves a few that
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
EMS and and uh the certifications under
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and water and those kind of
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
things that leaves them outside of
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
oplc this doesn't change what they
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
should have been doing but you're just
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find a way to say do it
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
however that is I I don't care so you
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable because oplc is
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
not on the hook the board Is Well
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the hook uh so I don't I
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
mean it's not completely alleviated it
 
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.950 align:start position:0%
mean it's not completely alleviated it
it's

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
not I I I would say there's still
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
implications yeah I would still those
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
other boards that are not covered by
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
oplc there are still implications if
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
they don't get the rules done and Rule
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
making you in my experience my very
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
limited experience and I'm not an
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
attorney is an arduous process it's
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
miserable it's a miserable process right
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and and and very important to
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of both the citizens
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the state but it's
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
it you know trying to get something done
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
in a year of this magnitude may be very
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
very hard what would your what would
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
your recommend Commendation be for a
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
timeline then I I think the shall have
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
submitted an initial proposal
 
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.189 align:start position:0%
submitted an initial proposal
language

01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
gets it it lights that fire and it makes
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
people do the work but it says you know
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
if we get fogged down and there's
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
further conversation that needs to
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
happen in the 541a and jail car process
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to put anybody out of so
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the subcommittee once
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal is filed I think
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
then you would have who
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
where does the train go from there like
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
is it outside like once it started can
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
it stop or is it is it on the train to
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
completion until it's done it can stop
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
it can stop and that's the danger and
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
and I also want to second that I think
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
one of the driving forces behind this is
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
is it is very true that this has existed
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
in statute for a decade and there has
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
not been a lot of progress on it
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
so two-tier dat so that's an interesting
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
I mean that's an interesting point the
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
other alternative is two date initial
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
proposal by 2025 completed by and then
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
extend that deadline out a little bit
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline out for a completion
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
six months even six months because more
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
than more than a miserable process I
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
think it's the timeliness of of Ru
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
making that is is the concern uh one
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
second you talking about converting
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
Moss's to civilian Specialties is that
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is that
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
why it's going to take so long I I just
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
no I I don't think that's the the the
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
problem at all I think the problem is I
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to be the
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
issue I mean we're going to be able to
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to advise the boards and
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
oplc what military experience and
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
training equates to will be able to come
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know we'll be able to work with the
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
board and kind of make those
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
determinations I just think that and and
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
again it was tongue and- cheek comments
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
about ruem it's difficult right it
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
really is that's my experience it's not
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know so uh I think that the it's
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
just getting through the the
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
requirements you know the legal ease you
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
know getting through the requirements of
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
getting the rules drafted sometimes it
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
takes a long time even the simplest
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules that we proposed for the
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
Department you know two years ago took
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
18 months to finish and they weren't
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
they weren't difficult rules I mean
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
simple and and I'm also referring to
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
consensus building reaching out to
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders getting in public input uh
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
for those kind of things both from
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
military expertise and also the like IES
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
in the state so just so we can work with
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
people just giving us enough time and I
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
might be right I'm also advocating to be
 
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
a bit over cautious here so so we don't
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in a situation where
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
we're in violation of the law and I'd
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
like to see that timeline extended just
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't happen that's where I'm
 
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.550 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't happen that's where I'm
coming

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
from that representative boy that is
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
exactly the original tent of what we
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
were looking to do and and uh University
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
of Washington has got a great crosswalk
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it's it's huge for because there's
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
so many Moss's it's mostly a military
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
crossw walk about that says these are
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
these MOS equal this um the Veterans
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
Affair office has something called uh uh
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
Corman to IMT that so the VA created
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
created a
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
position intermediate medical
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
technician IMT techn technician I think
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
where if you were a Corman you you can
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
basically automatically be that it's not
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
quite that simple but so that is kind of
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
what we were looking for and that I It
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
guess is sort of my expectation of the
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
rules I I I can't imagine the difficulty
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
of writing that in rule language but
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's that well that's that's a good uh
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
point you talk of Corman so you're
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
talking Navy I happen to be greenb medic
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
I spent 37 weeks training and I'm
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
equivalent to to a PA but how is that
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
established you know rather than just
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
eweek basic medic course right EXA
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
exactly sir and and and you know I'm
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
familiar I'm not I wasn't a green brave
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
but I was 28 years in the Army and you
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
know I'd rather have doc patch me up
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
than go to the hospital frankly I mean
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
you and you know you live that right so
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
but again I'm not talking about figuring
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
out that crosswalk to find out if that
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
training equals license board licensing
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
requirements I think we can do that real
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly it's the process by
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
which we codify that in administrative
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
rules that carry the way to law over
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
time I think that's where it starts to
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
take more time we can figure those
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
things out I mean there there are
 
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
systems representative Brown referred to
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
that exist we don't even have to make
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
them up they exist we can pull the
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
crosswalk off the internet or off the
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
American Council for uh American Council
 
01:17:45.719 --> 01:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
American Council for uh American Council
for

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
Education by which they advise colleges
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
and universities to Grant credit based
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
on military service and Military TR
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
training so we we have the groundwork to
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
get that done it's really just it's just
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
the process of making sure we get the
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
rules right to protect both the state of
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you know the licensing
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
boards and the citizens in New Hampshire
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's where it's going to take loes
 
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
that's where it's going to take loes
talk

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.390 align:start position:0%
talk
good

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
nice if represent Simon if I could just
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
make a couple of comments just overall
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
yes like this is great legislation right
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
so if we didn't do it we'd be okay and
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
if we do do it we're going to be great
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
right so I would tell you that the
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
department has a tremendous and robust
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
relationship with oplc with regard to
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
licensing and military transfer of
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
transfer of military training to lure
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
experience to lure it's not as codified
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
as it maybe it should be I mean the
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
department as it exists today and the
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for us to do this in the
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
department only came about in about 2020
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
in statute so we We're Young at it we do
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a we do have a uh a person on staff
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
her name is Erica Webb who does this so
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
we we are we are you Cally in bed with
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
oplc to make sure that we can do
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
whatever we can
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
do uh to help veterans or currently
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
serving members of the military get
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
licensing and oplc has done a tremendous
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
amount of work you know one of the
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
things that surprised me very recently
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
was when covid started if you were an
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
army medic you're automatically or you a
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
medic in the military you're
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
automatically can get an LNA license
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
automatically it's there right I think
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
there's a three-year requirement but
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
what a tremendous thing and so we want
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
to help advertise that kind of stuff
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
because most people don't know that that
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
exists so that's the first thing I would
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
like to say second thing is we're
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
working with director Courtney and and
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
the folks at oplc they've got a request
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
for proposal out to rewrite all of their
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and we are going to
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
have input from the veteran perspective
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are considering mil
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
milary experience and training so that
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
we can as as it pertains to licensing so
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's the second thing I would
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
say uh the third thing is as I mentioned
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to use existing systems to
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
kind of sus out how MOS transfers or
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
military occupational specialty or Air
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Force specialty code or you know or
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
whatever we call it in the rates in the
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
Navy uh how that translates to licensing
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know and primarily we want to use
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
the American Council on education
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
because they have a very robust system
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
that looks at uh you know if you were a
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
medic and you were promoted to Sergeant
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
as a medic and at that level you were
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
expected to do these things in your the
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty awarded it equals
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
this many credits towards a uh a med a
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
health degree so we could take that and
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
they automatically line up with
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements we can take that
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
and make that work
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh two things two last comments is we
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
don't approve licensing so it's like in
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
this process and one of the things we're
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
really happy about in the rewrite of in
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amendment that uh
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative Carol's brought by is
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no confusion right so the
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
veteran himself has got to justify he's
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
got a the burden of proof on experience
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
rests on the
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
veteran the burden to issue a license
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
rests at oplc and our job is to
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate that in the department right
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that the veteran
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
has a resource they can go to to
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
translate the requirements of the
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
licensing to what they know and we can
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
get them in the right place and the last
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say is we don't think
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is going to create a tremendous
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
increase in demand to the system right
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
so of the boards that oplc manages just
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
a cursory look without a whole bunch of
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
work going on we only think there are
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
about somewhere between 12 and 18 boards
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
that may even be relevant in this
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
process and we will look at the
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
occupational Specialties across the
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
we don't think that's a very high
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
density piece most most people in the
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
military are you know combat arms and
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
the professionals the logisticians and
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
the Medics they're a smaller cohort of
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the military so the people that might
 
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
even qualify based on Military
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
experience is going to be small just
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
based on what's going on than the
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
recency of your license you're a you
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
know like you're a dock you were you
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
were you were a team doc but those you
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
know those skills have degraded you
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be comfortable
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
doing some of those things today or as
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable as you were when you were on
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
an 18 team 50 years ago yeah and there's
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
been some advances in medical technology
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
right so just you know just so so so so
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
even then the the the proximity of or
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
the timeliness of your your separation
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
from the military is going to shrink
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
that population so we don't think this
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
is going to create a tremendous Demand
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
on the system but what it is going to do
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
is create a tremendous this opportunity
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
for us to make sure people have an ease
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
of getting licenses and everybody
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
benefits from that employers benefit
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
from it electricians plumbers uh Medics
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits from that so it's a
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing that we can do but I
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
mean the floodgates aren't going to open
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see a thousand people
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
or request licenses we we might see 40 a
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
year just based on just based on
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
population so those are the things that
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
I that I would kind of
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.629 align:start position:0%
I that I would kind of
mention

01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
represent schi so I I think your remarks
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
just now are very very important for us
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we we it's a black box
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have any idea what what's in
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
there how it would work what impact it
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
would have so knowing that it's 40 and
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
not a thousand or and that that's very
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
important for us to know what we're what
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're loading on our back or not
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
so that's very helpful to me and I I'm
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
well okay I've had a chance to read it
 
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.030 align:start position:0%
well okay I've had a chance to read it
it's

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
helpful no it's perfect and I heard what
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
you said as well so it's
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh so uh representative Brown nice
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
job catching the executive director
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
thing in paragraph two on the second
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
page oh yeah okay I was going to say
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
that that jumps that like literally
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
jumps off the page at you now it's like
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
wait a second um question um Mr
 
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.310 align:start position:0%
wait a second um question um Mr
osterhout

01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
osterhout
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
um this where was
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
it we have a reference to this for
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
temporary license should we change that
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
license so uh paragraph B page two the
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
applicant must submit a notorized
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit affirming under penalty of law
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
that the applicant is a person described
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
and identified in the application that
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
all statements made on the the
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
application are true and correct and
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
complete that the applicant has read and
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
understands the requirements for the
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
license certifies that they meet their
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and the applicant is good
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
standing in all jurisdictions in which
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
the applicant holds or is held a license
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
or is not subject to discipline and
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that's not even the one I
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
wanted C the next one is the one I
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
wanted the applicant May request a one
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
time 180 day extension of the temporary
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
license if necessary to complete the New
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensing requirements the
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
applicant must make the request within
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
15 days prior to the expiration of the
 
01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.350 align:start position:0%
15 days prior to the expiration of the
temporary

01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
license do we do temporary licenses
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
anywhere did we change that to
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
conditioner license
 
01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:33.189 align:start position:0%
conditioner license
conditional

01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
license so there might be some confusion
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
on that is
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
is so temporary license was a big thing
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
during covid right just to get Workforce
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
right in the door um conditional
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
licenses have a similar purpose in
 
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
that we can get somebody working without
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
having to wait the 90 days for their
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
criminal background check pending other
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
Protections in place so which seems like
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
that's what you're doing here it is what
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing here and that might just be
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
actually that's where it is it starts in
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
a the applicant shall obtain a temporary
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
license for a period not less than 180
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
days while completing the requirements
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
for licensure in the New Hampshire so
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
long as the cost for denial of the
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
license exists uh no cost for denial of
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
license exists under this title or under
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
any other law I under 31016 that whole
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
section is about ter temporary lure okay
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
I think from a practical point of view
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how that plays out in rule
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
it can sort of refer to one or the other
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
so there might be instances where
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
conditional or temporary might be
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat interchangeable I don't know if
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's 100% accurate um if you can find
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
out what the better word is yeah so that
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
if we do this we put the better word
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
into I can take a look at that and then
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
see which
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
word we want to put in there applicant
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
May request it one
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
time yes representative Brown uh thank
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
you so yes the the change that that
 
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
entire piece is in there but the change
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
was the addition of two and three and
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
bold below that and it was included
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
because she had to
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
change um Roman numeral one 2 and three
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
to Roman numeral one ABC d right so
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
that's why that whole thing I don't need
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
to tell you that I guess I'm sorry no um
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
but our our our intent with this was not
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
to ask for temporary or a quick license
 
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
it was just to ask for a fair
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
process that doesn't make a a
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
veteran take courses and take an exam
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't have to do that's
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
basically the idea so but I and I would
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
ask a the gentleman at the table I the
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
reason on the on the first page that I
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
added commensurate training experience
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
in a military occupational
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
specialty is because I didn't see it
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
specific I wasn't sure if it was
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
specific in the new two and three on
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
this page
 
01:27:54.679 --> 01:27:56.990 align:start position:0%
this page
too

01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be clear that
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere there the the veterans we're
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
talking about are not included in Roman
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
numeral one spouse temporary license
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses so I want to make
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure that it's clear in the words that
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
where they are included and I thought I
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
had added it to either two or three but
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
apparently I didn't I think I might have
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
thrown that in one of myund can probably
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
help you there y so I
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm better than myself and I
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
looked at my notes from the other thing
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
I do think looking at C now that should
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
stay temporary license but is referring
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to the temporary licenses
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
and that was not a change that was part
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that was there's a
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
little bit of redlining in what is
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
already existing Statute in here just to
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
clean up the language of 31016 okay if
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen we can live with the
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
language as is but I just that was kind
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
of tighten up the langu language thing
 
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
just a recommendation while we had it
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
open so I do think that piece should
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
stay temporary license okay there um as
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
far as the definition I'm I am there is
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
a concern about putting or commiserate
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
training and experience in a military
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty as determined by
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
the oplc in the very definition of
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
license because to me I think the
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
argument could be made that if I have
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
that training there's no reason to go
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
through the licensing process so I like
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
the that language I don't think um just
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
not there I just not there yeah uh where
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
we want to put that I'm not I originally
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
had bracketed um the new section three I
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
think it could also fit right below that
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
g74 a I'm wondering if it could fit
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
31016 um I could play around with it but
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
my my gut reaction was Roman numeral 3
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
the new proposed Roman numeral 3 okay
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
but I I'd want to look at that more
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
closely because that this morning the
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
first time I saw Roman numeral 3 meaning
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
what you gave me were correct yes okay
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
so the it reads the executive deor shall
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the boards councils
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
and commissions yeah so well I that fits
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
right for what constitutes military
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
education training or service acceptable
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
for this specific regulated occupation
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
and it seems like this commiserate
 
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
training and experience fits right in
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
with that section
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
three yes I agree but that falls under
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
the does because it comes under military
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
service members and spouse will
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
temporary licensure does that negate
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
that am I reading it wrong or am I
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
hard say that again for me sorry so the
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
new Roman numeral 3 is still under the
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh the title military at the top of the
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
page military service members and
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
spousal temporary
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
lure so a a person who has gotten out of
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
the military is not a military service
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
member nor a spouses so that might be a
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
good time to
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
change the title of the section of
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
3106 to make it a little broader and
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
just have
 
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
it office of professional Li Insurance
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
certification military service M members
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
and spouses take out temporary licenses
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
from the title then we have it one kind
 
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
of addresses the title and two and three
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
sort of address the long-term rule
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
making that we're talking about here or
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
the long-term lure that we're talking
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
about here and and and and we just
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
clarify the title a little more and we
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
expand it to two and three by removing
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
those temporary licensure rewards from
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
the from the top there and and I know
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
that you know what I'm asking for
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
but it's still doesn't say that this is
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
for a what's the right word a separated
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
after someone is initially out of the
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
military honorable a veteran just a
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
veteran it doesn't say that honorable
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
discharge I mean it says it in the well
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
it does say it in at the beginning of
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
the entire change to the law it's a the
 
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
veterans veterans license program so
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
maybe it's covered there but that does
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
that make sense yeah I I think I think
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
my reading of it is is sort of implicit
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
in that we're talking military education
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
training experience on its own I I read
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
it implicit in that statement even if it
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
isn't explicitly there I I don't know
 
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
isn't explicitly there I I don't know
what

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
other sorry no I cut you off so I would
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
say it's not important that they're
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
separated or serving what's important is
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
they have the training right so the
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
status of the veteran here is less
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
important then the they're able to uh
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
they have the burden of proof that they
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
have the training on them right so if
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
they're still serving in the guard or
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
the reserves and they have the training
 
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
or if they're separated and they have
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
the training and it's current in
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with the rules then I I I
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
think that's more important that they
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
can substantiate that they have the
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
training and experience than it is what
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
their status is currently serving a
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
veteran service member that's a that's a
 
01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:18.350 align:start position:0%
veteran service member that's a that's a
good

01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
point there's no reason why somebody who
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
has the experienc and is still enlisted
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to apply for a license
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
and receive one is there not so you can
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
plan ahead of time you know you're
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
heading towards retirement and you want
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
to make the change you can get the work
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
done before you're actually in the
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
situation and then just seamlessly walk
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
over does this allow for that we can do
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
it in rule I think okay that's what this
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
would allow for
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
okay again I'm not a lawyer but it
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude it right no I wanted to
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that yeah I wanted to make
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
sure that it was that I think that's a
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
fantastic fantastic way of going about
 
01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
it so I just wanted to make sure that
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
that was an Avenue that we could that we
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
could and mostly mostly in New Hampshire
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
right so in terms of population again
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
back to representative smid's comments
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
earlier we we don't have a we only have
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
about 1,200 actively serving non-reserve
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
members of the military in New Hampshire
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
most of them recruiters they work at New
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
Boston tracking station you know there's
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
not a lot of actively serving regular
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
guys everybody else to the tune of about
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
5,000 are in the reserve components so
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're currently serving they're
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently performing you know that one
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
weekend a month two weeks a year if
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
they're not deployed their military
 
01:34:31.629 --> 01:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
Mission flight Medics you know the guys
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
who pluck the you know hikers off out of
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains and the helicopters
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we send up there those guys are
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely licensed in the
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
National register of emt's licensed they
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
are so and you know electricians you
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
know some construction Engineers
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
plumbers they could do that so again not
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
to belabor it you know the horse kind of
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
turned into glue here but that's our job
 
01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
turned into glue here but that's our job
right

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
so but but it's more important that they
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
can demonstrate the training and
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
experience than it is what their status
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
is in the military in this particular
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
case I believe
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
that okay Mr chair yes what so would it
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
would it be simple just to add the word
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
title to to shut me
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
up so in in the term of art yeah veteran
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
or active duty though I mean or maybe
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
not maybe that's I mean we could it says
 
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
well it says military service member
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
right veteran military service member
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
and spouse the term of art we use in the
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
department is service member veterans
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
and their families there you go yeah
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's do that that sounds
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else concerns you got that
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
peterc Peter mik that's all right if if
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
we've got people out there who could
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
be gainfully and
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
beneficially doing something benefit
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
themselves and also people in the state
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
of New
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the only reason they're
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
not doing it is because they don't have
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
that little check mark or whatever then
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
we're we're wasting an opportunity and
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
we're also not only not benefiting it's
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
not it's not only that we're not taking
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
the money off the
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
table we
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're polluting the situation
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
because those are people who
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
are could be doing something and it's
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
potentially messing with their minds
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
that they can't do what they what they
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to do and what they would benefit
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
every everybody wins if we do it so
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
let's get on it let me follow up on that
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's a great Point uh r Schmidt and
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
and I think these guys have both heard
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
the story so let me give you the
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
two-minute story where this came from
 
01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
two-minute story where this came from
our

01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
son as a senior in high school said I
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
want to be in the Navy he did his early
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh early entrance for the first year
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
he went off to uh Great Lakes graduated
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
from his basic
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
training September 13 2001 so we knew
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
where he was going to be going right
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
right off right he did three tours in
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
Iraq uh he was in the Square the day of
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the bag in Baghdad the day the
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
statue came now so he was with the
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
three4 with the
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
Marines um then throughout throughout
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
his 14 years he was a pharmacy tech for
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
three years he worked in the hospital in
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
Primary Care in Naples Italy for three
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
years uh so he had a number of
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
experiences and I showed you his uh I
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
think I gave you his
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh tell me what it is list it's a it's
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
the military list of your
 
01:37:54.589 --> 01:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
experience and so 10 years ago he got
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
out and and we said to him well you
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
should be able to be an LNA or or
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
something like that and he said I can't
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
he said unless I go to classes and take
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
a test and and you know between all of
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
us here it's not for everyone to know
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
but he came home as representative
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
Schmidt said he sat in a funk for six
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
months because he really wanted to stay
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
in but that's another that's another
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
story but so that what your point I'm
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
agreeing wholeheartedly with your point
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
that some of these people that get out
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
of the service that was their life and
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's what they want to keep doing and
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's the point of this to to
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
bring in those people that have that
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
Public Service uh already that that
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
dedication to public service so thank
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate because the alternative
 
01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:43.159 align:start position:0%
to a win-win situation is a lose lose
 
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
situation and that that makes no sense
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh so you know I've been out
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
for uh since 195 58 um so it
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
was I don't remember everything from
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
those days but I do remember MOS and and
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
my my MOS was oh what was it Riflemen
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
Marines are all
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
Riflemen uh so but the point is that
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
when somebody use the word Corman I'm
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
going Bing I remember doc Hornback who
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
was the Corman attached to my unit now I
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what he actually what his
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
train was but but when we had anything
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
medical we got doc horn back in and so
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
forth uh and so so that's a term of art
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
to me an MOS is a term of art so those
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
things all mean something and to the
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
degree that that this this MOS means the
 
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
same as LNA or whatever and we're not
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
letting that person do that that's a
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
lose lose situation and I'm sure your
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
son was going like oh that's not good
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting around but the the the good
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
end of the story is he ended up working
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
at the VA Hospital on White River and
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
he's in Tilton now and he was used in
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
the emergency room during covid so it
 
01:40:06.669 --> 01:40:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's all ended up very nicely Happ happy
 
01:40:06.679 --> 01:40:09.430 align:start position:0%
it's all ended up very nicely Happ happy
to

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
say um but the but the magic word here
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
was commensurate training and experience
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
right in red and that thing so to the
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
degree that they are commen
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
then let's get at
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
it can I make one more comment because I
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
think we are talking about two different
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
classes of lensy and applicants here and
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the the the red line on
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
the first page the commerate training
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
and experience um I'm not sure Roman
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 on its own is sufficient which
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
is why I'm struggling because you're
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
going to have individuals under the oplc
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
and individuals not under the oplc and
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that language
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
applies to everyone not just it seems to
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
be the intent so it might be might be
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
worth putting that language in two
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
places not just sure that definition I
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
just want to yeah flag that
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying three doesn't
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
cover oplc three would cover oplc it
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover people outside of the
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
oplc okay because three that Roman
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
numeral three is a modification of three
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I was thinking four for
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
some reason four in my head so so maybe
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I was struggling because it
 
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it should be in both yeah would
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
you okay yep yeah because four is when
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
we break out to 332g right right three
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
um 74 so I I just want if we want it
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
applicable to everybody let's put it in
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
two places sure
 
01:41:38.239 --> 01:41:40.350 align:start position:0%
two places sure
um

01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
so the third page we we never
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
really came to a conclusion on what we
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with that as far as the
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
date understand the desire for the date
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to find something that's
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat acceptable to anybody how do
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
you feel about an initial proposal by 25
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
finalized uh Rules
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
by July 1st 2026 I I mean I'll defer to
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
the expertise of all of you in the room
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I've been involved with the dees
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
with rules and it's a solid
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
year if you're lucky I guess I mean
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's an official timeline that uh
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
that put out
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
but so I I I I'm okay with okay yeah I
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
mean I guess anything to just move this
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
off dead center is the right yeah
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
exactly I was going to say we've never
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
done it so a year and a half from now is
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
better than or two years from now is
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
better than never
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and with the that's not to say that
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't get those rules sooner just
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know like if you light the fire
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes people're like oh we've got a
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
deadline we better get moving they might
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
get them done faster than the deadline
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
but we just don't want to
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
I agree IP 25 final rules 26 it's great
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay well in addition to to have some
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
certainty as opposed to it's
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
com human mind does not like uncertainty
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that you know well
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
I've got a week or a month or a year or
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
whatever at at least it's something but
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
we got to make it that means something
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not just your promise will be
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
done in in in three weeks and it it
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen so and and I would I
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
would also argue that you know based on
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
the relationship we have with oplc and
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
the department has with with what
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing we're going to be doing
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
this before the rules get published
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
anyway right so if we can if we can
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
facilitate the license absent a
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
requirement in a statute we're going to
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
do it and so we'll be
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and I I find myself doing this
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
more and more and I don't know if I
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
should be but I'm kind of I'm making
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
sure other agencies have an opportunity
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
to know this is coming and give them an
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get eyes on to I think
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
from the oplc perspective I agree this
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
is something we want to do and we're
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
going to get started right
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
away and actually Mr chair that's a
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
question I have for you so because this
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
this addition to pushing the non-opc
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
boards to do this work has just been put
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
in here no one knows on those sides that
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
that this language even exists so
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:44:25.629 --> 01:44:25.639 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
mean oh as far as public
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
hearing they wouldn't have had had a
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
chance to I guess I guess that is what
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
I'm asking
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
you the original one yeah at least an
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment is I think yeah
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the original one only dealt with
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
oplc correct right the original bill so
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be that we can't do that
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get slapped for that one I'm
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
so from a timeline perspective what do
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
you want me to do or what do you want to
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
do it's not my bill anymore it's yours
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
but well technically it's ours because
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
you're still on this
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
ours yeah I I think we could do the
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
section one and the section two I
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't right that wouldn't be non- ger
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
section four here that were section four
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
is the one I'm questioning section oh
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers are a little
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
backwards yeah that that should be three
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then four but I'm just talking
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
sections now I'm getting nerdy here
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
sorry um so just the section four would
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
be the the piece that would be
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
problematic I think so okay
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
yeah but the op without without a public
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on it that's what I was last
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
night when I was writing this I was
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
thinking I don't know how I don't know
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
how it works yeah I think Peter would
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
you agree with that it's outside the
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
scope we didn't give the other boards an
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to know that it was coming
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
and participate in the public hearing
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's probably out that would probably
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
be non gerain
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
you have more experience than I
 
01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
you have more experience than I
do

01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah or someone does it next year or or
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
we take a Senate bill and attach it to
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that or we could I mean we have options
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
still ahead of us it's just so here's
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
here's the trick of where we're sitting
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee um we have an exec session on
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that's supposed to be the last
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
exec session I'm sure the chair would
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
like for that to be the last exec
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
session we start throwing in more public
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
hearings we're going to have another
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
exec session for one bill everybody's
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
gonna have to come in for um there's the
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
there's always the possibility of asking
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate to amend and if we're
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendable to it ahead of time it'll be
 
01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:35.719 align:start position:0%
an easy concurrence at the end um you
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
know you just always want to be careful
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't get screwed up doing it
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
that way too but that's an option you
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
know then we could just concur with it
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
but then that would have the opportunity
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
for a hearing on the other side and um I
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
think or no we would still have to bring
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
it back here wouldn't we well yes they
 
01:46:56.669 --> 01:46:56.679 align:start position:0%
do something that we haven't done yeah
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
then we would have to concur but we
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to have another public
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on it no no if there's been a
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
public hearing on one side one side it's
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
good yep okay that's what I thought so
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
that would be an option for you okay so
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
so my goal would be not to derail this
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
in any way for this year for this
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
session to move forward so certainly if
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
you have an idea in you know before
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
before next Wednesday they whether we
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
just pull that
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
out and try to amend that next
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
session which pushes it six months
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
farther out for those other boards yeah
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
I think we could probably get Senator
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
Pearl to agree to amend this in the
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
Senate I think so I don't think it would
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
be hard at all so when so if we took
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
four out here got it through the house
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
and it goes to Eda and Edna in the
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
Senate we'll just talk to Senator Pearl
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
when we figure out where it's going and
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
just say hey we're going to do this we
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
help we have to make sure that's going
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
to happen I did get a senator on this
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
hang on senator birdell who I've never
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
spoken to so I don't she's easy she'll
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
do it yeah I got but Pearl's the head of
 
01:48:06.119 --> 01:48:08.310 align:start position:0%
do it yeah I got but Pearl's the head of
Edna

01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
over CH I told you guys know more than I
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
do see we're here to help if we need
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
Senator B to sponsor the amendment that
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
that won't be hard that I could talk to
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
her that won't be hard I'm really not
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
seeing any of it as a problem I'm sure
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
probably like there are times I'm like I
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't feel that way about this I I agree
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
but the thing is we we have to make sure
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
that it does happen yeah because I don't
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
want to hear anything about next session
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're ready to do this right now well we
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
can have we can we can have a
 
01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:36.679 align:start position:0%
conversation as a committee to at some
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
point about whether or not if that were
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
to pass in the Senate we're going to be
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay with it um just to get a pulse for
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
it um so you know and worst case
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
scenario so here's what I would say
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
worst worst case scenario is
 
01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.629 align:start position:0%
worst worst case scenario is
honestly

01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
we amend the language in the senate
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
senate ask for concurrence for some
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
crazy reason the house decides not to
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
concur with it but we go to a committee
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
of conference there's no way we're not
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
concurring without a committee of
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
conference we go to the committee of
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
conference the house says listen we just
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
can't do this and the Senate says well
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to toss the whole bill so
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
we'll just strike our side and we'll
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
concur with you that that's worst case
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
scenario I don't see anything other than
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
that happening either you end up with
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
the language that we've got or the full
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
thing but I don't think you end up with
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
nothing I just don't see that happening
 
01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
so would would you like to make those
 
01:49:34.589 --> 01:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
few changes and send that off to me or
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
before and OLS OS is waiting for he has
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
it he's waiting for whatever changes
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we want might want to make you want
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
to on the date or I can do it it might
 
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
be better written if you do it not the
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
only recommendation we're making is just
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
to I've got this bracket here just take
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
this one section out if we said that to
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
OS just cross that out everything else
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
can go as
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
is oh say it again sorry I think the
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
only recommendation we're making here
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
well I move the language out of line
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
three we or the the definition so we
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
want them actually maybe it's easier if
 
01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
I just add the language and send it to
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
you today
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay you
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
want yes please is that okay yeah that
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
be great um any concerns from the
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee or anything anybody else want
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
it and and Mr chair I have one more
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
question for you please if you all look
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
three

01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh where it's deleted line 10 11 and
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
12 I'll wait for them to catch
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.910 align:start position:0%
12 I'll wait for them to catch
up

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance component the original
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
Bill page three line 10 11 and 12 so in
 
01:50:57.870 --> 01:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
this was a team effort there was 10 of
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
us working on this originally so
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
everybody had a bunch of different
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
pieces and and representative dun came
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
up with this piece about insurance
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
that somewhere someone talked to him and
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
said if this lure happens I think it was
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
because if it happens more quickly will
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
these people be covered by insurance and
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
I believe director Courtney
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
has looked at that and talked about it
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that we're on
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
the same page that we don't need to
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:37.350 align:start position:0%
 
fashion

01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
well oh about the examination or test
 
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
component of
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
it so we've probably Fallen outside of
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
what that sentence says now but where
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
We've Ended up
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.189 align:start position:0%
We've Ended up
right

01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying because we're we're
 
01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:53.719 align:start position:0%
providing the license without
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
potentially having to do the
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
examination if is do you know of an
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
instance where the insurance requires
 
01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:04.350 align:start position:0%
instance where the insurance requires
the

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
test I mean if they've got a most most
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
of them care about license right they
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
they care that they're licensed I mean
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're they're looking I think anyway
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
most of the time they're looking to the
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
state to determine whether or not
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
they're just looking for a stamp of
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
approval that the state has looked at
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
them and said this person can practice
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay I think but I've never heard of
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
them okay and it might be maybe in the
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
earlier parts of this there was some
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
thought that it was an accelerated
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
process or that in some way there it
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
been not as equal of a license maybe so
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure we're okay
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that I think so because
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
the force of the force of laws behind it
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
either way we've looked at it and said
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
this is an acceptable form of license
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
insure in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's temporary or you know the
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
full license this is how we've defined
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
it I've never heard of an insurance
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
company denying a licensed
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
individual insurance because they didn't
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
pass some other arbitrary exam of some
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
sort and I would say that I'm very
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
careful to say this right veterans
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
deserve a chance they deserve an
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to compete but they don't
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
deserve a free pass right so they still
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
have to meet the requirements of the
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
license to get it so me I understand the
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
issue that some insurance companies may
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
be reluctant based on what they might
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
think the license is but at the end of
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
the day there's no expectation from the
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
department and there should be no
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
expectation from the veteran that they
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
don't that they get a license that
 
01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
they're not otherwise qualified for so
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're not you know oplc is just not
 
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
going to give it out because they're a
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
veteran I don't know if I'm making any
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
sense no no I do but it brings up
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
another question you're right yeah it
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
brings up another question of is there
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
anything in this process from the oplc
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
side of things that they see commiserate
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
experience however they still would have
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
to pass this exam according to the board
 
01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
in order to get the license would that
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
exist I would say that's possible
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the license because the
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
board still has the right to set the
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
standard for the license correct so if
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
the board requires the examination they
 
01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
may have all of the other credentials
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
but I would assume they would still have
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
to take the examination to get the
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
license which they should be able to do
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
if they actually have the experi
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know I I agree with you right but
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
but again I you I made it clear that our
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
department can't make those
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
determinations only only just kind of
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
get well and that's also something this
 
01:54:34.109 --> 01:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
allows us to establish in rule so we can
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
we can do whatever we want yeah at that
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
point right as far as like to your to
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
your point setting the criteria for
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
licensure if they want the examination
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
because we need that then we can set the
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
examination and Rule and make that a
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
requirement but that's going to be the
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the board correct I
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
mean the board's going to look at it and
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
say I understand the military personnel
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
has all of this experience we're still
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
going to require them to take this
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
examination you know I can't speak for
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
the boards and there are 57 of them even
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
if only no I'm just saying if the board
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
came to you and said that that then the
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
military person oplc wouldn't be able to
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
override the board's opinion on that
 
01:55:07.119 --> 01:55:10.069 align:start position:0%
override the board's opinion on that
would

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
they so the board says we want them to
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
take XYZ examination in order to be
 
01:55:16.589 --> 01:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
licensed even though they have all this
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
commiserate experience get oplc look at
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that's gonna happen I
 
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:25.639 align:start position:0%
didn't think so yeah right in this
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with the boards and I know
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's always this question and
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
this tension about the final Authority
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
so I I see this as I mean it's the same
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
arguments I make often with advisory
 
01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
boards and and 313 and those kind of
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
things it's that this is not happening
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
without consensus and working with the
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
boards now are they going to get what
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
they want 100% of the time I can't
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
guarantee that but we have opportunity
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
for public comment we have public
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
meetings we have the jail car and the
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
administrative 541a process like there
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
are controls in place so the board comes
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
and says in order to be able to do this
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
you need to pass that examination that
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
unheard Brown so our goal in a in a
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
perfect simple world would have been
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in essence that that's yep
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
if you're this you're this you don't
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
have to take classes or take a test
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's that was the
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
original intent I agree I think that I
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
think my question is more I it was more
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
a question asked
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
to disprove the assertion than anything
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
else um I'm not sure that a board would
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
require an examination there like you
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
said there are 57 boards though there
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
might be some occupation out there in
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
which the overlap isn't perfect between
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
but they just said it's close enough
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
that if they can pass this examination
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
then we can give it to them you know
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was the only thing that was going
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
along in my mind otherwise they would
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
have to deny because it it wasn't
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
commiserate but they might be able to
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
look at it and say well it's close
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
enough if they can just do this one
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
extra thing then we can give them a
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
license and my question was just simply
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
in a situation like that opl's position
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
is what and it was what I expected it to
 
01:57:10.109 --> 01:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
be because we've been doing this long
 
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
enough and I could give you kind of an
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
example that based on some legislation
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
that passed last session right so we we
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
passed the general court was generous
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
last year and passed some stuff at the
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
at the direction of oplc
 
01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
that if you had 8,000 hours of
 
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
electrician experience in the military
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
you automatically qualified to be a
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
journeyman electrician you didn't have
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
to go through the apprentice license
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
right so that's just that's good that's
 
01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:35.719 align:start position:0%
a great law but what we did find was not
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily push back from the boards
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
but push back from the electricians
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
union right so they're not so right so
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily enamored with
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
this because now they lose control the
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
union lose control of the training
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
process right good bad right right wrong
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
or indifferent that's not an indictment
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
of anybody so there may be half of us
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
agree with you and half of us disagree I
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
I knew that was going to be is isn't
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
that the way that's why I said when you
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
run for office half to people
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
automatically hate you right that's how
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
it works so so you I'm not you it's
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
really not an indictment of that process
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that there may be
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
some instances where the boards would
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
say we want to be sure or there is some
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
pressure to the board from from external
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
sources that say we want to be sure so I
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's going to you know
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
what the law says one way or the other
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not necessarily just a done
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
deal because there'll be there'll be
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
some people who are really for this and
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
some people who think it's bad for the
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
system and you know the beautiful thing
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
for us is at that
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
point that's that's up to rules and and
 
01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.189 align:start position:0%
point that's that's up to rules and and
the

01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
boards until we get to Jael car and then
 
01:58:47.229 --> 01:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
then then they can deal with it but I'm
 
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
not on that yet so away stay
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
away and and and the other thing the
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
point I like to make is I think
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
underpinning everything oplc does is
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
protection of the public right and we do
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
a disservice to the public if we let
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who isn't
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
qualified get that license and so we
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
have to go to these subject men there's
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
there's no escaping it we are
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
interlocked and I I think that really
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be highlighted how much we rely
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
on each other and this
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
isn't I I just want to put that out
 
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
there right that that is our goal
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
bringing around full circle I don't
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
think you need that section because I I
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't see that as being a hindrance in
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
any way I don't think that the insurance
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
companies it's a robust enough system I
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
think the insurance companies are
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
looking for Li insure they're not
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
looking for anything else so I think
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I think we've covered everything we
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
were looking to do I'm um I'm really
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
heartened and gentlemen thank you really
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
so much um that I think that having
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
having the veterans agency sort of be
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
the the first focal point and if
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
someone's struggling to get through this
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
process that you guys can provide them
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
both actual uh emotional support and the
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
whole thing to get through the process
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I I'm really heartened by that i'
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
just like to say that this is 60 years
 
02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
just like to say that this is 60 years
too

02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
late I I I never mind we can talk
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
after I love I'm feeling pretty good
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
because this is day one for me so I mean
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
if it's 62 years 60 years too late and
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're getting it done right now I'm
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
doing I'm doing pretty well so I'm
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
feeling good about that I love doc doc
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
Doc's the best guy on the team all right
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
guys um so I think we've got a good
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
working order so I will let the
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee know now I'll be scheduling
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee meeting Wednesday morning
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
at 9:00 a.m. because we're going to have
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
to go over the finalized amendments for
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
the stuff that we're looking at today
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
and give our approval to it before exec
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
session starts so just to heads up when
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday 9:00 a.m. we'll be looking at
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
the finalized copies and hopefully we
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement on it and push
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
it forward to the full committee would
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
you like us to come back for that um if
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about like if you've
 
02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment ahead of time and
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're good with it your absence will
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
communicate to me that you're good with
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
it there won't be any surprises yeah
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
there should there really shouldn't be
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
any surprises I don't know I've seen
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff that comes out of oplc
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
and some of it's 120 pages long with all

yes so we're looking at bill um 1413 and
Bill

03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
1131 if you have those no um do you have
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
them you're GNA pull up 1413 and
 
03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:39.429 align:start position:0%
them you're GNA pull up 1413 and
11:31

03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
11:31
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any extra copies they're
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
really simple if you want to sit here I
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:54.660 --> 03:02:54.670 align:start position:0%
always commense
 
03:02:54.670 --> 03:02:57.070 align:start position:0%
always commense
[Laughter]

03:02:57.070 --> 03:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:03:00.429 --> 03:03:00.439 align:start position:0%
legislation um let's do uh because I
 
03:03:01.750 --> 03:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
think it's probably the easier of the
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
two let's do 1413
 
03:03:06.750 --> 03:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
first wow representative GRE if you
 
03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
would care to join us at the table that
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.349 --> 03:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
weird that it no so 1413 just repeals a
 
03:03:24.030 --> 03:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
section it's pretty easy and um we're
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're mostly going to be focusing on
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it sideway so it's
 
03:03:32.510 --> 03:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
bigger on the this section
 
03:03:35.550 --> 03:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
here okay so 14 1413 if you could just
 
03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
walk us briefly through what you're
 
03:03:39.870 --> 03:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with it that'd be
 
03:03:41.990 --> 03:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
great uh believe it or not I'm still
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
trying to pull it up by apolog that's
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
fine we're not in a hurry and Carol is
 
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
on her way and okay the more you delay
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
probably the safer for me okay that's
 
03:03:50.319 --> 03:03:52.910 align:start position:0%
probably the safer for me okay that's
good

03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
14 I'm ready if you're ready if not we
 
03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
can I'm ready okay so
 
03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
the what I presented actually redacted
 
03:04:08.190 --> 03:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
the entire section because when first um
 
03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
posing what I thought was going to be a
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
quick fix to the office of lure they
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually wanted the entire section
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
redacted they were going to put
 
03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
something in um requesting that because
 
03:04:20.429 --> 03:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
they think it's duplicative after
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
listening to the
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
hearing I actually
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
um I actually think maybe it was going
 
03:04:30.389 --> 03:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
to do things that I didn't intend it to
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
or where they were saying that well when
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
you take this section out it kicks it
 
03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
back to the regulations on conditional
 
03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
licensing which I agree with but I
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to put anything
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
into legislation that's going to be
 
03:04:44.349 --> 03:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
confusing or that's going to seem like
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to take shortcuts when it
 
03:04:48.269 --> 03:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
comes to licensing because that's not it
 
03:04:50.190 --> 03:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
so the big the big thing that what I
 
03:04:53.309 --> 03:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
started with was there's an older part
 
03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
in this where it says that the
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor um must assume both
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
professional and legal responsibility
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
now this is back from like around 1980
 
03:05:03.790 --> 03:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
so almost every one of these whether it
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
be social work all these used to say and
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
legal all of that language has been
 
03:05:09.030 --> 03:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
removed except for on this one the
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
complicating factor is with you know a
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
litigant um heavy Society is that saying
 
03:05:15.590 --> 03:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
that you're legally responsible for
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
another adult is a complication so I
 
03:05:21.870 --> 03:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to remove and legal um and
 
03:05:23.429 --> 03:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
if there's a better way to do that that
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be great but you know the the
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
problem is we can say it's hard to get
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors there are literally um
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
private practices that are having a hard
 
03:05:32.190 --> 03:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
time getting supervisors because they
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
see this and legally responsible well
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
that means if I'm legally responsible
 
03:05:37.710 --> 03:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
for somebody I'm supervising they go out
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
and get a car accident somewhere else
 
03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
and it's not specified then I'm legally
 
03:05:43.389 --> 03:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
responsible then too so I think think
 
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a Miss as our
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
language has evolved so that's that's
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm posing now we can either look
 
03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
at redacting that entire section if you
 
03:05:54.510 --> 03:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
guys think that that's the way to or we
 
03:05:57.550 --> 03:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
can just look at that particular problem
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
thing that was bottlenecking part of our
 
03:06:01.469 --> 03:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
uh super
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
supervisors okay yeah I mean I think
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
with both of these bills we're running
 
03:06:07.710 --> 03:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
into perhaps a similar problem where it
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
may actually be the
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the medical uh
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
psychological profession um that's
 
03:06:19.309 --> 03:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
causing the problems more than any true
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
legality issue U where anybody's
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually going to pursue that kind of
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
legal action but I know we've talked
 
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
already but for the subcommittee um my
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation for this because the the
 
03:06:32.349 --> 03:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
only thing that they seem to be really
 
03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that these
 
03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
supervisors wouldn't be legally
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
responsible for things that happen
 
03:06:39.150 --> 03:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
outside of the practice was to just take
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
the language from actually 11:31 the
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
bottom of it um
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
and just say that they're only
 
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
responsible they assume the professional
 
03:06:49.630 --> 03:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
ethical and legal responsibility for
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
such mental health services so they're
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
only they're only on the hook when
 
03:06:54.190 --> 03:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
they're providing the actual mental
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
health um services and I think that that
 
03:06:59.229 --> 03:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
would probably I think that's fair and I
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
think it also makes it um uh
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
complimentary in the two different areas
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not contradicting each other
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
that it's keeping it pretty similar
 
03:07:09.550 --> 03:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
consistent yes representative
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
Gard thank you chair maybe I'm missing
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
something if you're only when you're
 
03:07:16.349 --> 03:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
actually providing the services if
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
somebody was to receive advice from
 
03:07:21.670 --> 03:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
the professional and then go do
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
something is that considered you know
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at what point does it
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
become does it not become during the
 
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
service do you follow what I'm saying if
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
somebody was give them advice and they
 
03:07:31.710 --> 03:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
go do something can they say well that
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
guy told you know does it make any sense
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
or I'm totally missing him morph on this
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
oh I think I think that is the I mean
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
you might be able to shed some light I'm
 
03:07:41.469 --> 03:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
not saying it's your area of specialty
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it's not um no I think that's
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
the point is you're providing the
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
service is advice and you know that's
 
03:07:52.349 --> 03:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying if you if you said go do
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
this go shoot your mom that'll solve the
 
03:07:56.429 --> 03:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
problem you're G to be liable for
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
telling them to go shoot their mom if
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
you say hey you've got to work this out
 
03:08:02.229 --> 03:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
with your mom and they go and shoot your
 
03:08:04.229 --> 03:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
mom then you know the the
 
03:08:05.550 --> 03:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist isn't going to be on the
 
03:08:07.150 --> 03:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
hook for that they never said to do
 
03:08:08.229 --> 03:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
anything of the sort that was the
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation so I'm assuming that in
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
there lies the the differentiation but
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
by saying while they're providing the
 
03:08:16.510 --> 03:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
medical services you should you are
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
liable for that if you do harm you're
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
liable for the harm that you do and so
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's where the Judiciary would come
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
into into effect but at a c there is no
 
03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
record of any of this I mean there's no
 
03:08:32.309 --> 03:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
record of a um partitioner telling their
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
client anything it's all done in
 
03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
confidence right so wouldn't this this
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
is just
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
a I mean it's no point even anyway okay
 
03:08:41.790 --> 03:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
I'll sit back I think I think what this
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
does too is it it arrow and from just
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
saying like um you know I I'm legally
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
responsible you know just in general
 
03:08:51.150 --> 03:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
which could mean anything once you're
 
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
legally responsible like I'm your
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor so I'm legally responsible
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
for you well that's that's a big thing
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
now I'm legally responsible for you when
 
03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
you're in the workplace and you're doing
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
the things that are within your scope of
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
practice then that's that's kind of
 
03:09:06.750 --> 03:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
narrow that's like a medical malpractice
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
versus just being legally responsible uh
 
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
so Define drug like if they prescribe
 
03:09:14.349 --> 03:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
drugs and the
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
drugs the prescription's terrible and
 
03:09:19.630 --> 03:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
the person dies or that might be an is
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
an instance where they would be held
 
03:09:24.030 --> 03:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
liable for their medal their malpractice
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
because some of them can I believe in
 
03:09:28.349 --> 03:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
some instances do that and in the
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
supervis in the supervisor agreements
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're signing this so they're signing
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
like yes I'll be responsible or yes so
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you know so then so then so the
 
03:09:39.870 --> 03:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
problem is some of them are not wanting
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're stopping and going wait a second
 
03:09:43.630 --> 03:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
I don't want to sign this if it says I'm
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
legally responsible for somebody and
 
03:09:48.870 --> 03:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's it you know because then that you
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately the way that some
 
03:09:52.269 --> 03:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
things get twisted and stuff sometimes
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
somebody could say well you're legally
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
responsible period because I mean there
 
03:09:58.870 --> 03:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
are people that get injured and you know
 
03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
of course the reaction is to go after
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
everybody that they can depending on how
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
big that grievance is so it's just
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
protecting the people that are signing
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
on to be supervisors and narrowing it to
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
what they are specifically
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
supervising anything
 
03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
else anybody
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
else that seems like it's pretty much
 
03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
the whole thing on this one if nobody
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
else has any thoughts on it is just
 
03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
changing it so that instead of it saying
 
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
that they're legally responsible that
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
they would be um that they would be
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
responsible they're assuming the
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the professional
 
03:10:35.150 --> 03:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
ethical and legal responsibility uh for
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
such Mental Health Services we would
 
03:10:38.910 --> 03:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
just be putting that in to clarify what
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for does that make
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:44.070 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for does that make
sense

03:10:44.070 --> 03:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:10:45.309 --> 03:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
I agree and it's already are you
 
03:10:46.590 --> 03:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable Jason or are you
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
this I'm personally not a fan of
 
03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.269 --> 03:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
yeah licensing is theft is that what
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah uh hello welcome so sry first no
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay so um we were just looking
 
03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:09.429 align:start position:0%
that's okay so um we were just looking
at

03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:11:11.550 --> 03:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
1413 sorry I got a frog in my throat all
 
03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
of a sudden um and going back to 330a
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
22b here the only real concern that they
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
had was this idea that the supervisor
 
03:11:23.550 --> 03:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
would be legally responsible because
 
03:11:25.389 --> 03:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
they thought the term was Broad and
 
03:11:27.229 --> 03:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
might go past scope of
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
practice so my recommendation was to
 
03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
just take the language at the end of um
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
330 a34 they assumed the professional
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
ethical and legal responsibility for
 
03:11:39.309 --> 03:11:39.319 align:start position:0%
such mental health services so they're
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
only responsible and I think that pretty
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
much cleans that one up your thoughts
 
03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
I I agree that that it's I don't want to
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
take that section out because I I
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually worked on it to make sure the
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
um supervisory agreements were agreeable
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
to all and so um yes so it would leave
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
everything in place it would just
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that one point does that sound
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
good I'm good okay so now for the mor
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
fund one which is why I asked Doug to be
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
here even though it's outside his scope
 
03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:11.070 align:start position:0%
here even though it's outside his scope
of

03:12:11.070 --> 03:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
expertise um
 
03:12:15.870 --> 03:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
so HB
 
03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
so HB
1131

03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
1131
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
um why don't you tell us
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
again why this bill was brought forward
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.070 --> 03:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
it that's okay the first one only took
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
us 10 minutes so you're like way ahead
 
03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:41.630 align:start position:0%
us 10 minutes so you're like way ahead
of

03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:45.150 align:start position:0%
 
schedule

03:12:45.150 --> 03:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
you're

03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
fine so this one all sorry okay so this
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
one is so
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
currently uh the Dilemma is is that when
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
um people are currently under their
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
internship so when they're in school and
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're completing that they're able to
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually intern at an outpatient Private
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
Practice which makes sense they have the
 
03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor and all that you know that
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine now the issue is right now
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
with the way that this
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
reads um once they are waiting on their
 
03:13:24.229 --> 03:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
when they have just their conditional
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
license so they're waiting on their
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
permanent licensing yeah technically
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's no conditional license involved
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
though they're just they're an
 
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
unlicensed person un so when they're
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
unlicensed but they're still they are
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
still able to work currently at an
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
institution so what they what stops
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
though is them not being able able to
 
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
continue so they've been interning in an
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
out patient private practice that is
 
03:13:49.910 --> 03:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
allowed by law but once they graduate
 
03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
and they're waiting on that licensing
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
even though they could still be under
 
03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor right now they can only work
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
at a state institution or facility and
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we're just adding out patient Private
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
Practice we're not taking away the
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
supervisor or anything we're just
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
allowing that Continuum of Care because
 
03:14:06.910 --> 03:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
they can have you know upwards of a 100
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
patients that all o that all of a sudden
 
03:14:10.590 --> 03:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I talk with my hands too much that
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
are all of a sudden um not able to
 
03:14:15.309 --> 03:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
receive that care so it's it's just
 
03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
really helping with that Continuum and
 
03:14:20.990 --> 03:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
more of U housekeeping so I have a
 
03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
question yes yes that's fine from the
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
testimony on
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
143 I got the impression sorry that
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
a someone who just
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
graduates can go to work for
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit Clinic
 
03:14:41.479 --> 03:14:43.710 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit Clinic
immediately

03:14:43.710 --> 03:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:14:48.750 --> 03:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
and be but cannot go to work for private
 
03:14:50.910 --> 03:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
organization until that private
 
03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
organization has a supervisory agreement
 
03:15:00.190 --> 03:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
specific to um that person in place and
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm and why the discrepancy that was the
 
03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
that was why I hoped you would get
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
somebody here here I've I've been knee
 
03:15:09.870 --> 03:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
deep in this for a couple days now and
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
and we just had a lot of fun over lunch
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
break actually I talk to Lindsay um
 
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
here's the problem with this section of
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
law nothing's
 
03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
defined so if you're looking for the
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
definition of any of these terms in
 
03:15:25.950 --> 03:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
statute you will not find them so it's
 
03:15:28.750 --> 03:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
wide open to interpretation institution
 
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
is not defined facility is not defined
 
03:15:33.389 --> 03:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
and and to be fair outpatient private
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
practice is also not defined if we add
 
03:15:38.070 --> 03:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
that in and clinical supervision is not
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
defined um so I was talking to director
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
Courtney on the phone and ironically she
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
just had was having a conversation with
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
somebody um who was running into this
 
03:15:53.189 --> 03:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
situation where the chair of the board
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
um had told her that she couldn't
 
03:15:55.750 --> 03:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
practice because she was in an
 
03:15:57.550 --> 03:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
outpatient situation and had to wait for
 
03:16:00.910 --> 03:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
her lure to come through and uh director
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
Courtney went down the same rabbit hole
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
that I did which was trying to figure
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
out where in law it says that you can't
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
and we can't find one we don't think
 
03:16:13.469 --> 03:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
that this proc includes outpatient
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
private practicing from continuing care
 
03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
because they still have
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
supervision so what we're considering
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
doing is defining the terms in this
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
section to cover the people who need to
 
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
be covered specifically so that when you
 
03:16:29.550 --> 03:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
go back and ask the question what is
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
facility it covers outpatient Private
 
03:16:34.030 --> 03:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
Practice in its definition so that it
 
03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
includes everyone and there isn't any
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
discrepancy my concern with just adding
 
03:16:39.309 --> 03:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
outpat and private practice into this
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
section is the vagueness of everything
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
else is still in place and in fact we're
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
adding vagueness by adding outpatient
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
Private Practice because what is that
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
technically and then we're going to have
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
this other group of people so what the
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
board what the chair of the board was
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
did not do is point to anything other
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
than this piece of law RSA 330
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
a34 to indicate that this individual
 
03:17:07.229 --> 03:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
could not continue to serve at the
 
03:17:09.389 --> 03:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
outpatient Private Practice Clinic and
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
and be legal so yes one
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
one concern that I
 
03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
have is that this allows an a totally
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
unlicensed person to work under the
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
general supervision of the staff but a
 
03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
conditionally licensed person apparently
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
needs a specific supervisory agreement
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the board yes and that
 
03:17:41.110 --> 03:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
appears to me to be a disconnect yes I
 
03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
agree so so what what's what's a good
 
03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
way to fix that
 
03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
disp that's that's what the discussion
 
03:17:50.189 --> 03:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
is and hey it's a pullback on licensing
 
03:17:53.389 --> 03:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
so it's right up your alley hop in um
 
03:17:54.990 --> 03:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no no and and we were having that
 
03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
discussion as well um I don't know if
 
03:17:58.990 --> 03:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
you guys would feel comfortable sitting
 
03:18:04.910 --> 03:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
next to each other um but uh yes so the
 
03:18:07.469 --> 03:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
the goal is as Mr osterhout put it at
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
lunchtime you've got ABC and d and they
 
03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
all basically are doing the same thing
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
but we're creating an exemption for a b
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and c but not D that's what we're trying
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
to get away from so that everybody who's
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
working within the same scope of
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
practice has the same freedoms the same
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities um none of them are
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
unfairly restricted um so yes and that
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
was also part of the conversation so um
 
03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
my request uh to oplc has been already
 
03:18:36.750 --> 03:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
and I was going to run it by the
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as well but since you're
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
here you can chime in um to come up with
 
03:18:45.269 --> 03:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
with definitions that work to close all
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
of those loopholes so that we
 
03:18:50.110 --> 03:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
can put all of those people under one
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
umbrella and they're all operating by
 
03:18:54.030 --> 03:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines I think that's fantastic
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work on that yeah
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
because that showed up when we at the
 
03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
hearing for 1413 when it appeared that
 
03:19:07.070 --> 03:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
most of the testimony was irrelevant to
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
this the
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill I mean we were sympathetic but
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
didn't okay didn't pertain um so yeah so
 
03:19:17.070 --> 03:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
we're in this kind of strange and this
 
03:19:17.910 --> 03:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
why I said it was going to be an
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation we're kind of
 
03:19:20.189 --> 03:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
in this strange realm where you're
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
saying you need this change because
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise they can't do it and both oplc
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
and at least me um agree that I don't
 
03:19:31.030 --> 03:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
think this this says that they can't
 
03:19:33.510 --> 03:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
well I think if I could explain that
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
where that came from so there are a few
 
03:19:36.830 --> 03:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
private practices that are very
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
conscientious and also with with their
 
03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance um looking at that that their
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
malpractice is going wait a second so
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is something that I think would be
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
very helpful to be more defined because
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
especially when you have you know
 
03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
anytime you're in the the medical field
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know the malpractice and your
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
insurance is so specific and you have to
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
be so careful so I think these are
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
situations where people maybe are being
 
03:20:04.110 --> 03:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
overly conscientious but for good reason
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think there have been issues that have
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
come up so yeah well and and that's what
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to get to the to the
 
03:20:10.469 --> 03:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
bottom of and we have not been able to
 
03:20:12.389 --> 03:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
find anything in rule or St statute
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
outside of this and so I think that the
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
confusion came as to where this idea
 
03:20:20.710 --> 03:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
came from and we can't figure out where
 
03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
the idea came from so if you were to go
 
03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
ask the the chair of the board which is
 
03:20:26.429 --> 03:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that you would typically go to
 
03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
to ask the question whether or not this
 
03:20:31.150 --> 03:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
is a problem that person would say that
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
this is a problem but we can't figure
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
out why they're saying that this is a
 
03:20:36.269 --> 03:20:36.279 align:start position:0%
problem and that's where this is getting
 
03:20:38.110 --> 03:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
a little confusing Mr user would you
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
like to share anything I I I don't
 
03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
remember if I forgot something that you
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
remember I don't know what you left for
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
me to say I think you stole all my
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm so sorry I feel
 
03:20:51.309 --> 03:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
terrible I usually like to share and I
 
03:20:54.510 --> 03:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
guess I wasn't playing nicely um but but
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
you agree with I agree right I think I
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
see there you go just the weight of your
 
03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:02.770 align:start position:0%
testimony behind me is helpful getting
 
03:21:02.770 --> 03:21:08.070 align:start position:0%
testimony behind me is helpful getting
[Laughter]

03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
things uh yeah I think I think I don't I
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
don't understand where that interpret
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
coming from because I certainly didn't
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
read that in the law and the oplc
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't read that into the law and if
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's ambiguity I think it's best it's
 
03:21:22.950 --> 03:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
best um addressed by defining words
 
03:21:25.309 --> 03:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
rather than keep carving out exceptions
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then to your point we carve out one
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
more does that now preclude something
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
else that we didn't foresee let's just
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
Define it uh get rid of that ambiguity
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and I think that's
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to be better for everybody yes
 
03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
chairman aguire I think one thing you
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
could just say instead of saying
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
institution facility
 
03:21:46.269 --> 03:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
Etc say it's an organ an
 
03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
organization that in that provides these
 
03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health
 
03:21:53.120 --> 03:21:54.950 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health
Services

03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:21:54.960 --> 03:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
Services
has

03:21:56.510 --> 03:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
licensed count licens individuals on
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
staff and provide supervision because
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's you don't really care how that
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
how it's set up as a not for profit or
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
for-profit or a hospital Branch or
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
whatever right it just that it's an
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
organization that has
 
03:22:17.950 --> 03:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
licensed people on staff that provide
 
03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:19.349 align:start position:0%
licensed people on staff that provide
supervision

03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
to either conditional lenses or um
 
03:22:24.920 --> 03:22:27.950 align:start position:0%
to either conditional lenses or um
unlicensed

03:22:27.950 --> 03:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
individuals that makes sense to me
 
03:22:32.110 --> 03:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
because that I don't know quite how You'
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
say that but that that's the point is
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
that the yeah those organizations do
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
Mr I I think that's a policy decision
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
right and then if you want me to define
 
03:22:55.710 --> 03:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
words we can work on definitions and if
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
you think this I wrote down the key
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
components the organization licens
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
people on staff and supervision we can
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
play around with that language too and
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
see if we can make it
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
simpler absolutely any other thoughts
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee no
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay I I think the goal is right like
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned is to level the playing
 
03:23:20.910 --> 03:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
field level the playing field and we
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't have different classes of people
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
here but we're treating them like we do
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that's the problem
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
wherever the confusion came from yeah so
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
my only other concern is what you
 
03:23:34.030 --> 03:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
brought up which is um once you start
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
adding in supervisory agreements which
 
03:23:38.950 --> 03:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different but then you
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the institution behind it you
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
don't have the organization ation behind
 
03:23:46.830 --> 03:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
it um which that's going to affect a lot
 
03:23:49.229 --> 03:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
of the rest of 330a because a lot of the
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
rest of 33a deals with supervisory
 
03:23:53.830 --> 03:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
agreements so this is an exemption from
 
03:23:56.429 --> 03:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
in part the supervisory agreements and
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
the intention is that that is to
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
be the individuals who are who would
 
03:24:05.750 --> 03:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for a conditional license that
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
is they've been trained but they are
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
not through their residency as it were
 
03:24:13.189 --> 03:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
and I've been informed by director
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
Courtney that in this specific instance
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
there isn't really a conditional license
 
03:24:20.110 --> 03:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a two-year permanent license
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
really wait a minute we just it's called
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
a conditional license but it's really a
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a unique license type in
 
03:24:28.030 --> 03:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
and of itself where you need the
 
03:24:29.469 --> 03:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
supervision while you complete your
 
03:24:33.189 --> 03:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
hours so the term conditional is really
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
there because it's not permanent but it
 
03:24:37.630 --> 03:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
is a two-year license it's conditional
 
03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
is a two-year license it's conditional
on

03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:24:40.950 --> 03:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
them they can work but if they don't
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
complete their their supervisory hours
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
by the end of the
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
license they're in trouble and
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
eventually you should graduate to
 
03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
permanent licensure full LIC the idea
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's just what she said I don't know
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
you can call it whatever you like
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
is tempor by the end of this day
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
temporary license conditional license
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
Perman it's
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
just just mix it up and pull one out I
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't know temporary it's conditional or
 
03:25:10.269 --> 03:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
um oh no this was this was a
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
conversation from the last yeah yeah no
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
no no that's fine that was totally for
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
Doug mostly yeah I I had Brad look up
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
the history on this and this was not
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
really discussed and since it was 30
 
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
years ago 25 to 30 years ago there's
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
nobody around that remembers
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
right okay well unless anybody has
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
something else to um to add I think that
 
03:25:34.590 --> 03:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's the D I mean that makes sense to
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
me that would probably be the easiest
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
way to go is just to create the just
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
clarification clarification yeah do you
 
03:25:43.630 --> 03:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
want us to do the organization licensed
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
people on staff supervision route or the
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
defining well if we do that I think we
 
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
just remove institution facility from it
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
altoe and then maybe we'll have to
 
03:25:56.309 --> 03:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
Define what clinical supervision is
 
03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
because I think that the I think the
 
03:26:00.189 --> 03:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
idea behind clinical supervision is that
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
the organization itself has supervision
 
03:26:05.710 --> 03:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
has supervisors it's not a it's not a
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
supervis supervisory agreement it's not
 
03:26:10.590 --> 03:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
a one-on-one it's a you might have
 
03:26:13.229 --> 03:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
multiple people under one supervisor um
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
so I think usually do yeah so I think
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
that we'll want to Define clinical
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
supervision and then I think you're
 
03:26:24.429 --> 03:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
good I think that solves it I hope thank
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
you all so much I really appreciate your
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
work on this and I see how thorough it
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
was you're so good 25 minutes told you
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all though I really do
 
03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you it was better that you
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
were here though I appreciate it well
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's I was the one who who listened to
 
03:26:40.469 --> 03:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
the T and then decided that we needed to
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate these to or consider them
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
together right do it all right so this
 
03:26:48.030 --> 03:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
one you got you got a nice simple
 
03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment on that yeah it should be
 
03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:50.469 align:start position:0%
Amendment on that yeah it should be
pretty

03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
easy and I'll work with Doug to get an
 
03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
amendment for uh
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
1311 11:31 11:31
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
perfect okay thank you so
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
much thank you for uh for having done so
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
much of the
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
work yeah yeah yeah that that did help
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna close the work
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
session then and thank you guys so much
 
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
for your time I really appreciate it and
 
03:27:16.990 --> 03:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh we'll see you Wednesday uh so uh we
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
will have a subcommittee meeting
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning at 9:00 A.M because
 
03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to vote on the
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments that are coming for this
 
03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
stuff the committee is meeting I think
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
at 10 at 10: but we're going to meet at
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet at 9: and I will
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
need people there because they'll be
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
voting so if you can that would be
 
03:27:32.750 --> 03:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
helpful if not let me know so I can
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
replace you on the other hand
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
fair
