e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
careful all right thank you so I
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand that the comproller would
 
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
like to go first
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
yes is that right so yes that would be
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
great all right so we'll move her to to
 
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
the next item of business and otherwise
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
approve the
 
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 align:start position:0%
agenda any other agenda changes no uh
 
00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
all those in favor I any oppos okay good
 
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.710 align:start position:0%
all those in favor I any oppos okay good
go

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
ahead okay um my sections are sort of I
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh I guess number four and number five
 
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
on your agenda so you have the um the
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
book that we issued last November in
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
front of you the big green book
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
um what when the agencies present to you
 
00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 align:start position:0%
through these uh fiveyear reviews
 
00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
they'll we've tried to align their
 
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
presentations with the book so you can
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of watch you know read their
 
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
presentation along with the book um so
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will make things smooth
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
the normal report that I give you every
 
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
year on the inactive funds um Jen just
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
passed around to you um we just kind of
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
take a snapshot of anything that appears
 
00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
inactive based on activity in our
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
financial system for the last two years
 
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
some of these are are repeats every year
 
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
and you've talked to them before um a
 
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
couple of them may look new but
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes um new funds get established
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
and they take some time to get started
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
to actually get Revenue in especially if
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's something that's donation based um
 
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have revenue on day
 
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
one so sometimes it does take a couple
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
of years even to get these things
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
started um and sometimes the spending
 
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
Trails behind as well so you'll see if
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
if any of these um spark your interest I
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
can get you more information directly
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
from the agencies uh the top section are
 
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that are not coming to see you
 
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
this year so if you want some questions
 
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
answered or you do want them to come in
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
they they're not planning to be here but
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
we can certainly reach out and get you
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
some more
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
information uh the the second section
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
are the folks that are reporting to you
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
this year so um Department of Natural
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources is on your
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesday agenda and education is here
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
today so they can speak to you directly
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
about the funds that they have that are
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
considered inactive and then on the last
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
page uh a flip the page is just
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation who you spoke with last
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
year um they do have a couple of funds
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
that popped up on the new sort of newly
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
inactive list but they have some that
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
you are you definitely had on your list
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
as inactive last year as well so they
 
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
you know they would be ones that you can
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
decide if you want to speak with them at
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
all so could you make us a revised
 
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
version of this table that has the
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
amount that's currently in these funds
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
um well it just means there's no
 
00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 align:start position:0%
activity so there might the amount may
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
be zero um in some cases the amount may
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
be stagnant but it typically
 
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
um the fact I I can do that for you um
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
but in a lot of
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
cases it's that there's no ins and outs
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the last two years so part of this
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
review that's my point is but if it's 3
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar with no ins and outs then
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
we might want to investigate it but if
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's 50 cents sure we can I can add the
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
balance uh sometimes yeah I I guess it
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
depends on each fund but um most of them
 
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
are typically relatively low balances
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
um that's the only handout I had yeah
 
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.950 align:start position:0%
um that's the only handout I had yeah
for

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
today and I'm sorry I didn't introduce
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
myself I'm Dana
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
call most of you saw me last year but
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
right um did we do we have a secretary
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
head thank you I didn't bring paper um
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
and um can we assume that
 
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
and um can we assume that
anything

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
after 3 316 or 344 I'm not sure which is
 
00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
new enough that they can't reasonably
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
operations yes I'll the last four on
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
those are relatively new cuz if if
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
they're numbered in the high 3es then
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
they have been recently ad Ed in the
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
last couple years and likely just
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
haven't had any funding yet so that is a
 
00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.270 align:start position:0%
haven't had any funding yet so that is a
good

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
assumption other questions for Miss call
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
Rep Senator gray not necessarily
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
question what I generally do is youve
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
got the the RSA numbers here and the
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
book has an index by the RSA number so
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
you just look up the RSA number go back
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
in front number and you can be right
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
there at the P so it's it's not tough to
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
do get that balance and I book what the
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
book since it's inactive fun that what's
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the book ought to be pretty darn
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
close to what they've got
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
now right even the new ones we give them
 
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
a page in the book even if it's all
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
zeros they get a page so that you get a
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
description of the fund you know when it
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
was created that type of information but
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
it could stay it could stay um with no
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
numbers for four years some of them do
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
so but I can put that I can add that
 
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
column to the memo that's not hard all
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you other comments yes
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative I got one more question
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
on is the judicial Council still in this
 
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
in this book I believe their one uh last
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
fund was repealed so yeah they wouldn't
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh depending on the timing of the repeal
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
sometimes it lags and they stay in the
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
book if they were repealed during the
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
course of the fiscal year but I can
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
check I know we had them not come to
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
their review with you because their one
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
fund was repealed so
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
right and we've got to figure out if
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
statute it it should have been repealed
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
both from 612 and the underlying statute
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
typically that we try to make sure that
 
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.869 align:start position:0%
typically that we try to make sure that
happens

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
check and I'll be here I'm just I'm
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
staying as long as I can but I have a
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
commitment later this afternoon so I'll
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
listen in and help with any questions
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Miss call anything
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
else all right next item on the agenda
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
is uh status of legislation so we had
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
our bill last year House
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
Bill we had our bill last year House
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
the left does nothing the right one goes
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
off that's weird I only have one so I
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
have a different
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
model oh this is the
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
chance oh well all it doesn't matter all
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
right so um so our bill passed that was
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor it had one small
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
addition from what we sent into it which
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
was um that the uh veterinarians were
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
only getting 80% of the cost of of their
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
fees for neutering and um so the bill
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
changed it to 100% right so that that
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
was the only only small change but other
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
than that it was the same bill we had
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
with okay um fiscal year uh compilation
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds okay we already did
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
that big big book and active funds all
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
right agency review is the banking
 
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
right agency review is the banking
Department

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
you and let's let's find their page
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
here and you've also
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
got spreadsheet now for each of these oh
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay and it does give the
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
six2 but we really should start putting
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just bear with us for a moment sure
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you could tell me the page number two
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
27 yes because they are not
 
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
27 yes because they are not
obviously

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers yeah they're in some weird
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
number all right so I see you have one
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated fun we do so please introduce
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%

i
 
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
sure my name is hopeless to spell
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't even get started on my first name
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
I'll answer to anything really that
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
Amelia it's not no my parents it's my
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
parents and my husband none of this is
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
my fault um it's em
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
l e m l all right thank you continue
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
okay um so yes as you can see from the
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
report uh the banking department does
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
have one dedicated fund um and we are
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh we use the dedicated fund that we
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
have heavily and it's key to the
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
function of the banking department so we
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
would like to keep it active please um
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not be aware the
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
banking department is a self-funded
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
agency um that means in short every year
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
we get an appropriation from the
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
legislature and then over the course of
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year we collect fees and
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
fines um and if necessary an assessment
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fiscal year to fully
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
refund that appropriation and all those
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
fees find and if necessary an assessment
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
go into the dedicated fund with the sole
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
purpose to pay that um pay that uh
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation back at the end of the
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um so for that reason we
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
need a dedicated fund it's how our whole
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
agency is set up um we revolve around
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
the dedicated
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
fund I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
was there an unusually big um fine in
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
2022 there was there was so we did like
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
I think it was Clos to $2 million so
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
we've been we actually that enabled us
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
to lower our per DM assessment on the
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
entities that we regulate so our fees
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually correspondingly got lowered
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
because of that large fine gotcha other
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
much how much do you expect to keep in
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
there um for emergency kinds of things
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
from year to year yeah so I mean ideally
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
so my goal is always to avoid an
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
assessment because if we don't have
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
enough to pay back at to pay back the
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation we do an assessment and an
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
assessment on the consumer credit side
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
is very administratively burdensome we
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
have about 4,000 entities that are
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
licensed under us so we'd have to like
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
calculate out each portion of theirs so
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
um my goal is to always retain some in
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
this dedicated fund so that way we never
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
get to the point where we have to do an
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
assessment but the goal is to keep keep
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
that so your expenses are very
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
predictable but the revenue is not is
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
that right or not well it depends on the
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
fine so some years we have a big fine um
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
because we catch somebody doing
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
something unlawful um and then the FI
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
the revenues go up and then we calculate
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
out our per DM rate that we charge for
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the examiner the exam time and we take
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
into account that we took in a large
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
fine so we can reduce that expense so
 
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's but our most of our budget is
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits so in terms of our
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
actual budget it is relatively
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
predictable because I think we're at
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
like 82% or 86% of our budget is
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits right and and but
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
there's also fees which are probably
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
pretty predictable too right yeah yep to
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
some extent yes uh our licensing fees
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
have been the same for a long time
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
however um the economy somewhat dictates
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
how many lenses we have at any any given
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
moment if there's a lot of um if for
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
example mortgage rates are high right
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
now so there's
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people gain new licenses to
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
be mortgage Originators for example so
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
that tends to bring our licensing fees
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
down in that department or that division
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit um so it is a little bit
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
fluctuation thank
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
you other questions yes yeah
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative W what's a typical Bank
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
pay for this
 
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.470 align:start position:0%
pay for this
service

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
so uh so for an examination are you
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
asking how much we charge on average for
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
an examination of a bank okay so um on
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
average a bank exam takes give or take
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
60 days so our per DM right now for
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
banks is a little over
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so about $60,000 give or
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
take depending it you know it sort of
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
depends on the business model of the
 
00:15:58.319 --> 00:16:00.030 align:start position:0%
depends on the business model of the
bank

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
bank
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
um what what they're up to how many
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
examiners we have to staff if anything's
 
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.710 align:start position:0%
examiners we have to staff if anything's
going

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.230 align:start position:0%
going
on

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
yep how often does a bank get uh
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
examined every 18 months give or take
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
some get examined more frequently if
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
they've got certain things going on um
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
if they're a denovo bank a brand new
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
bank they get examined every year and we
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
also do a visitation on a denovo bank
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
great all right other questions no
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
com I'm I'm sorry I can't I I apologize
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
um I'm going DEA too uh could um I
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand how how you were
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
having trouble with just fees in
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
figuring out um and then you mentioned
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
settlements later but it'd be good if
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't include fines in the funding
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
source because it seems to be quite
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
significant okay I guess it's not broken
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
out here we do like when we report to
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
and this is a little bit beyond me
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
because I don't actually do the
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
reporting in New Hampshire first and all
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
of that but we do have a separate bucket
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
as we call it for fines and a different
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
bucket for exam fees so we do have that
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
data out there yeah um and it all goes
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
into the same one yeah I'm sure this is
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.549 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%

you um so I guess we'll just start with
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
um page
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
174 we provided you a handout that has a
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of History if someone's not
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with the New Hampshire veterans
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
home and how it's managed um so it it
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
was established in
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
1890 134 years we are um made up of uh
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
the board of managers who oversees the
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
actual um managing of the facility with
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
the governor we have uh 12 members that
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
sit on that board um all citizens two of
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
those are actual veterans that live at
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
our facility so they oversee the
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
operations of the veterans home we are
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
intermediate long-term care facility uh
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
we have licensed for 250 beds in the
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are budgeted
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
usually for 2 25 and we have nearly 400
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh staff with the state um our greatest
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
challenge right now is
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and we are uh state-owned
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
but the majority of our funding does
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
come from the VA Grant Program for those
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
veterans who reside with us our mission
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
statement is uh to provide the best
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
quality of life for New Hampshire
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
veterans with dignity honor and respect
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
which we work every day at uh there is a
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
form in here called the resident data
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
dashboard that is similar to this um it
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
has the breakdown of what we have for
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
veterans right now we have 129 veterans
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
117 of them are men 12 are women um and
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
we always have the ongoing discussion
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
about what branch is the best branch so
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
we break that down because our residents
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
love to be competitive um and then we
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
have the uh conflict air uh era in our
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
application weit list and our weit list
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
for beds so I just wanted to give you
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
some general information again our
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
primary source of Revenue is through the
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
VA about 39% of our budget comes through
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
the VA uh for the pum rate uh room and
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
board that's 32% where veterans pay for
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
their room and board if they have the uh
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
means and the assets to do so and then
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
General funds covers about 29% of the
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
cost we have three dedicated funds
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
the benefit account the guide Thompson
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
account the yes let me let me ask a
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
quick question is this uh money from the
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affairs is that new no that's
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
the way it's always been paid they it's
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
a PDM rate we um we have two levels of
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh care for our resident uh if they are
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
70% or more disabled then they are
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
called a prevailing rate resident if
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
they are under 69% or less they are
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
called a basic rate and uh the pum rate
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
is a daily at midnight we do a count of
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
how many residents we have and then the
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
VA pays that portion uh to care for
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
them because I was on division three
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
years ago and and it seemed to me that
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Home was 100% state but I
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not not not as far back that's
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
the way I remembered it but okay I'm
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
wrong yes that's okay it's good right
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to have the VA cover
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
our cost um so three dedicated funds uh
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
as I said the benefit account is our
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
largest account that account um is funds
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
all of our uh quality of life activities
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
the monies that go into that benefit
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
fund are through donations so D
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
donations from our veteran service
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
organizations from Community um people
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
who want to donate to the veterans home
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
memorials and that is all uh in one
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
account and um as you can see that those
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
are things that we use out of that
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
account are voted by the board of
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
managers um and we look at that so an
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
example is cable for all residents the
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire doesn't pay for
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the benefit fund pays for that um
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
different outings that they go on so the
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
first two accounts are very similar in
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
the sense that the goal is to cover
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
those those um activities the second uh
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated account and I can go in more
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
detail uh is the guy Thompson Memorial
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
account and that is a $155,000 base
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
account uh that we never touch the
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
principal so we only take uh the
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
interest from that and we honestly take
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
that around Christmas time we withdraw
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
that around Christmas time to help pay
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
for Christmas for the veterans um all of
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
these funds these dedicated funds uh
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
these two accounts are managed or all of
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
our accounts are managed by the New
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire treasury as well for
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
investment purposes so the dedicated
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
fund the largest one is the benefit fund
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
the majority of that those funds are
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
invested um in right right now money
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
markets they had been in the history
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
been CDs but their money markets and so
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
what do we do with that money on a
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
regular basis we pay for the um
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
recreational therapy uh the team itself
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
the staff are paid by the state of New
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but all Resident activities
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
are paid out of this fund um so that
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
might be interactive TVs or iPads we do
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
birthday celebrations Arts projects um
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
gardening Bingo which is really popular
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
um holiday
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
celebrations um we do uh youth groups we
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
have a sunshine cart because the quality
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
of life to us is really important and
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
the veteran go shopping and can get the
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
same things you or I may want um they go
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
on um Community trips out to
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%

sightseeing parades plays concerts
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants um and as you can see I love
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
to put the pictures of the residents in
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
here as well um and then we have other
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
quality of life aspects we have a town
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
hall that we hold all of our ceremonies
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
in in our regular ongoing meetings we
 
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
have a Main Street St uh Main Street
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
store where they can go shopping we have
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
a library a full library that is covered
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of the cost of that library is
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
covered by the benefit benefit fund we
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a chapel a barber and a hairdresser
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
shop we have Courtyards dining rooms
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
living rooms and something we call the
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
vet cave which is um if you came for a
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
tour you would see a giant train uh
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
setup that uh they often are working on
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
and then we have computers for them to
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
access so those are the quality of life
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
um things that are paid for at those two
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
accounts yeah thank you let me get into
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the detailed numbers here I I think
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
on page 174 is there an error because on
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the year 2022 the ending balance was
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
1.8 million but that means the beginning
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
balance of 2023 should have been 1.8
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
something and it's not
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
yes yes I can see that yes that does
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
look to be an
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
error yeah I think I can add I think
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
when we transition to some of the um
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
accounting for other items um we might
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
have just had a a year where something
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
just transferred wrong we were um
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
changing sort of the format of this
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
report a couple years ago but um any any
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
adjustments that we find through this
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
review process we just make those
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections in the new report and we'll
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
write a a footnote in the current year
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
report to explain whatever Corrections
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
we come across so it does happen Okay
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
but good question so the balance might
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
even be 2 million something right um on
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
our letter um yes yes yes this report is
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
accurate yes the report that we gave you
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
is accurate which one uh 2.1 uh 2
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
point Mr
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
chair Mr chair this this was a prevalent
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
this was a prevalent thing a few years
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
ago and we the committee have made
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
changes to make sure that if they have
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh obligated the funds you know that it
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
gets put in the right year and then the
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
old reports that obligations sometimes
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
was and sometimes wasn't reflected and
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
then when they started the new number
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
then they would reflect it and it caused
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
all kinds of problems I'm not saying the
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
old numbers are good but the new numbers
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
ought to agree they ought to the ending
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
balance and the the one year should
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
agree with the beginning balance and the
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
next year and so if they're not the last
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
couple of years I wouldn't worry too
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
much about it
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
but for what it's
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
worth yes you're correct the idea was to
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
make that simplification um to have
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
those balances roll but this is uh
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's a manually input uh
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
database so sometimes things do get
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
crossed over and we try to catch them
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
but we'll make the adjustment going
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
forward all right thank you
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative wer thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
several years ago before you were there
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
we found out that they had gone over a
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
year without paying the fuel oil
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
bill you probably remember it yes sir I
 
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.149 align:start position:0%
bill you probably remember it yes sir I
do

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
$333,000 yeah how did that occur that
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
it if I remember
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
right um the business office sent the
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
invoices to the commod at the time and
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
the commod at the time didn't approv
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
them and then when we changed commants
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
so I think the state had to dig in and
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
pay the bills yes sir that is correct
 
00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:06.710 align:start position:0%
pay the bills yes sir that is correct
okay

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
so does the board look at these things
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
regularly yes sir we do all right so
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully this won't happen again
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully we we uh are uh we review
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
What's called the Exhibit C every month
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
um at the at the monthly meetings thank
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
sir represent of all me thank you um
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
what's this
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
87,3 74 this year
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
used in addition to the
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
funding um so we had a large donation
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
left to us from a resident who had
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
passed and so that is going to we wanted
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
to use the money to honor him um and so
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
we are we have a pond on our our our
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
property and we are going to pave about
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
half of it around so it's wheelchair
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
accessible right now really it's not
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
very safe if somebody went down in a
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
wheelchair with L uh small pads so we
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
can have covered gazebos and so that's
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
going to be an honor of that Resident
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
who uh left that money for something to
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
be done and that's how we've we've uh
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
decided to use that those funds
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so those don't go into the
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
donations don't go into the revenue all
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
our donations go into the benefit fund
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
and then we each quarter bring the um
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
requested funds forward to the board of
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
managers and ask to spend this amount of
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
money one of our goals is never to spend
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
any more than what we have for donations
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
um we are very fortunate that we have a
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
lot of support a lot of support uh for
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
donations at the veterans home so again
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't normally make a purchase
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
that large uh our purchases are much
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
more reasonable um but because we had
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
Beque this we got this money bequeathed
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
to us this is how we chose to use
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
that you you do spend the income though
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
right I mean the the income yes but we
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
try not to touch the base of it we we
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
want those Investments to be there the
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
in this case it's it's the the total
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
amount of the donations yes I understand
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay now the balance has been creeping
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
up over the years is that deliberate or
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
you just can't think of
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
other ways to improve the the life of
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
the residents or well we're very
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
particular about it because if it's
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
operational we feel like the state of
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be under the
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
operations this is really meant to be
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
donations for the residents um and I
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
think in the past when we had 225
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
residents Christmas was bigger because
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
we had more residents and we're in uh a
 
00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:02.919 align:start position:0%
deficit with the amount of residents we
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
can uh bring in because of the Staffing
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
we are having a tough time to staff our
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
nursing units so when we have more
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
residents there's more cost there's more
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
activities of or cost for an activity
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what you're seeing
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing four to five years of
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
really tough Staffing and not being up
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
225 residents and and so that's how I
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want to spend money just to
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
spend money I want it to be reasonable
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
and um but our we have really robust
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
activities so we don't shy away from
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
that but I think that's what you're
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
seeing is that creeping up because of
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
the low census what is the census 1229
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
today we have 11 pending admissions so
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
um with my Staffing right now I feel
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
very comfortable going to 140 residents
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that I think we would be risking
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
quality of care um and it's just
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
something we can't do until we can have
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
additional staff hire more nurses
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
what's the length of the waiting list um
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
we are spinning that around really
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
quickly now so we have 20 people on the
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
actual weight list and 11 of them
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
already have beds assigned no one is
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
more on that weight list more than right
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
now today more than three months we have
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
applications 27 applications that could
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
be from day one to uh going through the
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
process so some of that depends on when
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
we get medical records from doctors um
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
when we get the financial records from
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
families or the applicant so the
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
application process could take a bit but
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
we still don't have any applications in
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
process more than earlier this year in
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
March so that's really good because
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
we've had people wait for over a year
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
before my goal is that when we approve
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
somebody we can offer them a bed um that
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's the goal so when I came in uh two
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago we were at 121
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're creeping up to 140 um and it as
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
long as we continue to have staff we'll
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
continue to increase our census to meet
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
that meet all of the
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
need all right any other questions on
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
these two
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
funds no let's go to the member account
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay so the member account is um it's a
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund but it's it's for it's the
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
resident money it's not ours it's not
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire's it's
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
actually the resident money so part of
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
being um you know able to make your own
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
decisions and have a quality of life is
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
spending your own money the way you want
 
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.230 align:start position:0%
spending your own money the way you want
to

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
so this is like a an account within
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
count there's many count accounts within
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
that so they have um their um retirement
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
do uh submitted into that they might
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
have their social security deposited
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
into that and each member has their own
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
account if they choose to do that we do
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
have members who have chosen to keep
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
their finances very separate the family
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
pays a monthly bill they give them
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
monthly money to spend uh the way they
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
wish but many of them want to to have
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
the monies come in they still make all
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
their own decisions we have uh a very um
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
thorough process if they want to take
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
money out we have them sign everybody
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
signs we have a lot of steps of checks
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
and balances on how that money works and
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
if anybody has over $100 in that account
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
when we have monthly interest which um
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
not a huge amount but when we do get
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
that it gets spread through all of the
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
members so they have the benefit so this
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
allows them to continue to manage their
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
own funds we're not telling them how to
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
do that um and uh this is one of the
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
things that they can do to still become
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
independent and so you keep separate sub
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
accounts for each individual so yes
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aly thank you I apologize
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
I was still trying to find the places I
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to write things down when you
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
rattled off I think it was the
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of the expense es your
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
expenses that was from ran board at 32%
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
but then the I missed the VA and I
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
missed entirely the other support I
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it in there um it's I
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
should put a page number on these
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I so after the resident data
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
supported so 39% of our Revenue comes
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
from the uh Veteran Affairs get that
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh I missed this one so maybe there you
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
go oh yeah 32% from the residents
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
themselves and then
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
29% from the general funds I'll just
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
keep it open to that and that can change
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
so the more prevailing rate residents we
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
have we get a higher fund uh a higher
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
payment um reimbursement daily and uh
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the packed act being signed into
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
place we're seeing more veterans have a
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
high High um they're qualifying for a
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
higher disability rating and so there
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
are many more that are uh being being
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
moved from that basic rate which is um a
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
lower rate to the higher rate to the
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
prevailing rate so it it really can
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
still change this is you know this is
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
today's numbers this is the percentage
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
of how it works
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
today and if a resident passes away then
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
this money is returned to their family
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely their account is we have 90
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
days by the VA regulation we're licensed
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
through the VA we have 90 days to clear
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
their account meaning that we have taken
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
all charges that are going to be taken
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
out of that and then send that back to
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
the families so um we're really we're
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
really faster than that um we often get
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
complimented when we have our yearly
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
survey through the VA for processing
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
them much quicker uh that way the funds
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
go back to the family
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative M me and if um you
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
have somebody who can't pay either came
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
in that way or I yes yes so we uh the
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh pays for uh
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
the uh National Guard National Guard is
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
not recognized if they haven't deployed
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
and they haven't met the minimum
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
requirements of the VA they do not see
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
them in their in their view as their a
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
veteran but they don't pay for them
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
under the long-term care um act but the
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
new state of New Hampshire does we we
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
respect in our thankful for their
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
service so sometimes we have uh I think
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have three or four veterans right now
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
that are National Guard uh that's not
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
paid by the VA so that will skew our
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
numbers a little bit of how it all
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
breaks down because it's not just one
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
pot so represent W is that true of all
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
the National Guard people that that the
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
VA doesn't recognize their service it's
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
not recognize their service it's for the
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
predum rate of Nursing Home Care so they
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
do not uh the government does not pay
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
unless they've been deployed and they
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
have to have certain things that get
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
checked off the box if they served for
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know 20 years and never were
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
deployed um at your because it's a State
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
National Guard is State uh so they look
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
at it that way uh some other state
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
veterans homes do the same thing we do
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
the state covers the cost so we still
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
pay for them um but it it's something
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
that is a Cornerstone of of the New
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans home to serve all
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
veterans they still have to be a veteran
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
they get a DD214 they're still
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
classified as a veteran it's just for
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
this pay Source this program they do get
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
a DD214 yes thank you thank
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
you what's a
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
DD214 okay she asked what's the
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
DD214 uh the DD214 is the discharge
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
papers from the federal government the
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
honorable discharge or any discharge any
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
can be any good summary of your service
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes we got
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
it do members ever tip a staff no we
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
can't accept money okay
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes we don't accept money we don't
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
accept gifts it which can be tough for
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
them because they want to do things for
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
us but we just we can't do that it's uh
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's against the rules it's against the
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
the process and so we always tell them
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh something else is a nice thing to sit
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
with them and just chat um we get a lot
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
of donated cards so sometimes they'll
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
just write us a card uh it has no cost
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
to it but it has a value to us that
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
means more than a tip thank other
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%

00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
yes commissioner don't think that I'm
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
walking out on you I do have a doctor's
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
appointment in Rochester but they are

recording this just for me so that I can
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
be able to uh go back in and watch this
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
see um what page is he on 240 page 240 I
 
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.870 align:start position:0%
see um what page is he on 240 page 240 I
think

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.829 align:start position:0%
think
maybe

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
revolving fund there it is
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
right he has
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
many this is the the bulk of what we're
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
doing today oh is that right
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
R by the way how did they get away with
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
not paying the heat for a year and they
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
kept it warm over there you
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
know I guess their vendor thought they
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and I know you need
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
no introduction but go ahead for the
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
record Frank GBL Commissioner of
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
Education Tammy Valen Court CFO for
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
Education thank you all
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
sure and I'll just answer questions that
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
copers so this this one is mostly used
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
for um purchase of uh legislative books
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
for the legislature and the department
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
the rule books of the education laws is
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
how we use these funds in addition to
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
renting in addition to renting copers
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
that then we back we charge Revenue out
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
to the various programs to pay for the
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
rental of those copers in the paper
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
involved that's kind of a net yes so if
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to print those books how
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
much would we
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
save uh I think those books cost around
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
$122,000 yeah 12,000 and they're going
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
up and you'll notice that last year got
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
skinnier because it's hard to find an
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
editor who's willing to find all the
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
annotations that are just specific to
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
education rules but I can tell you
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're very popular and very useful for
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
people educ committee always wants
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
to I know they do but I mean doesn't
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
mean we have to do it they go to allus
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
what's that do they go to all they do
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
not we provide all the saus we do a
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
digital copy as well that we put on
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
thumb drives and we mail everybody a
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
laws yeah and and we send those not just
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the seus but oftentimes people say
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
can we have the education laws and we
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
have these thumb drives that we send out
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
that are part of this cost as well
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
but a lot cheaper than a book who is
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
that a lot cheaper than than a book it
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
is but there's a lot of people who want
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
to Mark in the book and many legislators
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
who prefer to have those books
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
so right okay do do does
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
that what explains that the expenses got
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
a lot higher for three years and then
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
went down again yeah so it's um
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
basically finding we had a tough time
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
finding even a publisher who was willing
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
to go through the process it used to be
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
done I forget one of the the popular
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
legal publishing companies and then it
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
was difficult to find somebody and the
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
price just there like if you want it
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
done this is what it's going to cost so
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
we reduced the scope to really focus on
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
specific laws but it just was because
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
again it's very limited the number that
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
we are publishing so they're kind of
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
like for that we don't know if we want
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
so and that's when we went to the thumb
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
drives because of the cost that's when
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
we went to the thumb drives exactly
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
because we used to distribute a lot more
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
well I'm trying to look at several
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
things at once this one is the one that
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
was handed out by everybody I can't find
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
your copy of it so I using my copy of it
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just working out of the book
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
that I think you all have yeah but then
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's 2024 numbers yeah the 2024 went
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
down too so right that's not in your
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
book yeah your handout is a year has a
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
year extra information so I was at
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
16,000 last year is my expenses it went
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
down a little bit I'm not sure why okay
 
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
down a little bit I'm not sure why okay
gotta

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
now should we worry that the balance in
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
this fund is is declining or are you
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
just going to increase these uh little
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
charges yes so we try to balance the
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
fund so that we don't have an excessive
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
amount and so we will go from like
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
charging two cents a page for printing
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
to three cents and then we'll bounce
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
back to two if we start to generate a
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
lot of Revenue
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
okay I guess this is reasonable yeah
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
other questions no okay let's go to the
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
certification so is there some reason
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
this is not handled by
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
oplc if there is I don't know what the
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
reason is why it's not handled by oplc
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
we don't I don't think we have an
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
objection to moving over to oplc
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah I don't know why why it is
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
at this agency there's not a ton of
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
activity going on there
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
um you know it would be good to have
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
more interpreters probably uh it was at
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
education because we do rely on
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
interpreters particularly needing to get
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
licensed interpreters for the schools if
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
for our kids who are in need of that
 
00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:49.150 align:start position:0%
for our kids who are in need of that
support

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
um okay there's not a ton of
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
activity and it it can't have a
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
full-time employee with this kind of
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
number number no none of these have
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
fulltime I don't yeah we don't have any
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
full I maybe some of them do but we
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any employees this is just
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
all handled by the accounting department
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
or people with other
 
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.829 align:start position:0%
or people with other
responsibilities

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay so possibility of of a action would
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
be to move this to
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
oplc yeah
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay the ending balance it's been going
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
up a lot over the years it has right
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
because we get our we're it's I think we
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
what's my Revenue source on this is the
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
fees that people are paying so maybe
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
those fees could be reduced those are
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
those fees belong to oplc not to us so
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
they get sent
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
OPC I believe they're all that's where
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're licensed and then that I gets
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
transferred the revenue kind ofs
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
transferred over to my account is that
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
how we're doing
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
it okay we don't have an we don't have
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
an educator credential called
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
interpreter certificate
 
00:47:57.079 --> 00:47:58.270 align:start position:0%
interpreter certificate
I

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
see yeah and oplc is pretty good about
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
balancing fees and costs right
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
so if this balance got too big they
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
would fix it yeah and we try to do the
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
same thing for the ones that are in our
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
space yeah all right it's been it's grow
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
okay other questions oh
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
fund now this is a private
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
trust corre and that's important to
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
notice in a whole bunch of these they
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
are private trusts they were put in by a
 
00:48:48.839 --> 00:48:49.990 align:start position:0%
are private trusts they were put in by a
will

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
usually um they're a little difficult to
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
change this as well you'll see we get
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
this giant income in 2022 where they did
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
a mark to Market on all of the
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
Investments that were being held there
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's in a couple of our private
 
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
that's in a couple of our private
funds

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
wow much of this the work like so we do
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in need of Aid and
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
support and
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance um who are Indigent blind
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
are generally eligible for either Social
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
Security Disability Administration which
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
the department administers or vocation
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation services if they're
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
working so um there's a variety of
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
programs to support them in addition to
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and a lot of the future
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
Insight work we have several contracts
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
with them through vocation
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation to support this type of
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
activity because it it seems like there
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
ought to be more use for the the fund
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
again but I have because I have another
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
funding source I'm I think I probably
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
default to the vocation Rehabilitation
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
funding source as opposed to this
 
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.349 align:start position:0%
funding source as opposed to this
fund

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it's extremely difficult to
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
wind I know it's extremely difficult to
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
wind these down I mean if you're get to
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit world and just see if
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
individuals want grants to do this work
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
um to support it right we don't have any
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
staff member assigned in here or
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
so um if you think that that would be a
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
that yes uh represent um yes thank you
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the um the revenue
 
00:50:44.599 --> 00:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the um the revenue
for

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
2023 it's surprising to me that that's
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
about one less than onethird of the year
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
before when interest rates have been
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
High um why is that so that's because in
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
2022 there was rebalancing by the
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
treasur of the funds where they marked
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
them to Market so that's why you got
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
this you know on $468,000 you generated
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
$178,000 of Revenue um and that was
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
because they did they had all these Book
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
value um equities that they marked to
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
Mark in and so it just looks like a a
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
substantive increase in the return on
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
funds that here I see yeah now there's
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
another fund for the blind coming up
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
later yeah and is there could could
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
maybe that one be folded into this one
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
so the other fund for the blind let me
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
go back it's you could vending stands
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the vending stands so that's
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually a very specific program
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
basically the legislature has granted to
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
um The Blind Association the ability to
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
operate uh machine vending in the rest
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
areas in the state um and so that is
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
what that fund is doing so I'm not sure
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
if they could be conflated or not um
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
since well this one
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
is is funded by the general fund right
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh it is which oneing the vending stand
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
by the vending stands yeah there's
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
vending no there's vending machines and
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
the only difference that you'll see is
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we were able to in 23 24 we
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
suspended the fees because when Co
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
happened many of these vendors got hurt
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
and so uh they lost Revenue
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
buy so we gave a like several years
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
reprieve on the fees because there was
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of funding in the accounts to be
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
able to support it but you generally
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
spend from both of these funds for the
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
same things yes um I don't know if I
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
would call that the same things I mean
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
these are you know um very
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial individuals on the
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
vending set like these are guys who are
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
running vending machines right and we're
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
basically helping them be G somewhat
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
gamefully employed relative to that as
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to the other is more of kind of
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
a Aid fund for indent individuals in
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
need oh are you saying from the vending
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
fund you're spending to give back to the
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
people running the vending machines yeah
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's basically just a fun to basically
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
kind of collect and support collect and
 
00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.150 align:start position:0%
kind of collect and support collect and
support

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
oh and and we buy equipment like we'll
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
buy equipment for them or
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah oh so so right representative me
 
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.630 align:start position:0%
yeah oh so so right representative me
yeah

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
so did the general fund give any money
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
to them at the beginning of this it
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
looks like I don't know how this was
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
initially funded yeah it's been around
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
but but it is not a private trust this
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
one is not a private trust it's just an
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
operational fund as opposed to the other
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
one is a private trust and I think has a
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific use of
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
funds but but it seems weird we're
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
charging the money and giving them back
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
money what what's the point of that
 
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.470 align:start position:0%
money what what's the point of that
right

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're buying the equipment from
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would say that some vendors are
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
more profitable than others and so we
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
are collecting a fee that then gets
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
dispersed amongst all of the vend and I
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
call them vendors
 
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
call them vendors
the

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
The Operators thank you and um and then
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
we turn around and we purchase vending
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
machines for them um and then they're
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
responsible they go stock it and make
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
sure that it's operational and keep it
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
rolling so we're basically setting them
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
up in business for those who want
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's not a tremendous demand first of
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
all vending machines are waning um you
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
know secondarily there's not a ton of
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to do this but
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
those who come to us have been at it for
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
a while or if there's a new person
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
coming in they're saying like I want to
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
try and earn some money with this this
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
is an eligible program for them
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
so okay but you said in the future needs
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
um that you would in the future support
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
aspiring entrepreneurs by providing
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
essential resources training and startup
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
cap capital and
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh and enrich our communities through
 
00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh and enrich our communities through
diverse

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
diverse
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
businesses it sounds like you're trying
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
to go away from just the vending
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
machines no no it's just the vending
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
machines it's all this diverse meaning
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
like you know maybe different types of
 
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
products through those vending machines
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
because there's not really another like
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
they own and they have the reservation
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
on the vending machine real estate in
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
the state rest areas
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
yeah in state buildings and state
 
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.109 align:start position:0%
yeah in state buildings and state
buildings

00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay and state buildings yes the ones
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
downstairs yes there rather they aren't
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
downstairs that you have to go variety
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
of places but near the G yeah yeah I
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
mean you know like if if we wanted to
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
wind this down we could just not add
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
anybody new to the program and just let
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
it attenuate while the current vendors
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
who are using it or doing it but if a
 
00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:24.039 align:start position:0%
new today if a new person came to us and
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to get set up and started we
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
would start them
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
oh so um UNH would also be involved in
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if we have stuff at
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
UNH or not I'm not sure I just I know
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
mostly the the um state buildings and
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
the uh rest areas and I think the rest
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
areas are the ones that are most
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
prolific for
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
them is there a full-time employee
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
running this program there's no
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
employees running it okay do we even
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
allocate time to it I'm not sure Patty
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't work on it but do we charge any
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
time to it I no I don't believe so I
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
don't think we even charge any any
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
administrative time I don't think we
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
charge anything to this I
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
see all right we we'll consider this one
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
I guess all right and then you might
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
want to consider that with the John nbet
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
were because you had we can't really do
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
anything together with
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
them I mean would you so when what is
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
the the desire of the legislature do you
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
want me to try and go find some
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and we just make grants to
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits to serve these individuals I
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
mean you mentioned future insight I have
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
a variety of contracts with Future
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
Insights but I could make grants to them
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
to support you know they can make a
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
proposal say here's how I'm going to use
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
the money and we'll award them you know
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
my income is about $40,000 a year to
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
support these individuals we could do
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
that at $40,000 a year you'd be getting
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
fund unless we get a major I could just
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
operate yeah I could just like I could
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
do 50 000 and bring it down some or I
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
could you know but a lot of this revenue
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
is driven off of the return on the
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
investment right on the fund balance so
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is I could do a grant
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
equal to whatever my revenue is in the
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
prior year I just grant it out to folks
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know maybe minus a an inflationary
 
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.510 align:start position:0%
you know maybe minus a an inflationary
Factor

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there's an appro annual
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation to you and that's what's
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
increasing this balance up from 425
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
years ago to 685 yeah the appropriation
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
is just the interest on the Investments
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right so that's what I'm
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that we would
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
just you know grant that to someone to
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
support this the mission yeah of Miss at
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
least the amount of interest each year
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
to to get people to use it well for yeah
 
00:58:52.359 --> 00:58:53.109 align:start position:0%
to to get people to use it well for yeah
the

00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
blind but again like I can like there's
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know most of these individuals end
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
up getting plugged into the uh vocation
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation programming and Social
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
Security Disability Administration
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
programs and so you don't see a lot of
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
you know especially you're dealing with
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
indent folks like there's other social
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
service programs that are wrapped around
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
these individuals which is probably why
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're not turning we haven't been
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
turning to this because we've already
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
got something dealing with
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
that and those other programs have all
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and process
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know to to get people to plug them
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
in to move them through whereas this
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be kind of an ad hoc thing and
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're not charging administrative fees
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
to this and I don't know if we want to
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
so would it make sense for this to be
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
Education are they the ones dealing with
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
blind people more often or not so we do
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
through Vocational Rehabilitation we
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
have a blind services division oh okay
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so we do support the
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities yeah I live in Lebanon New
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they took all of the State
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
offices and moved them to Claremont and
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
then moved some of them out of Claremont
 
01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
then moved some of them out of Claremont
to

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
Newport uh which means that most people
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
can't get to them if they're you say
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
that one more time I missed the
 
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.349 align:start position:0%
that one more time I missed the
beginning

01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:00:22.359 --> 01:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
beginning
on

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
on my city of Lebanon uh used to have a
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
lot of State Services most of those
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
Services have moved out and a number of
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
them are in only in Newport at this
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
point you can't get there there
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
accessible yeah yeah without a car
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
because there isn't much bus service in
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County there is a little now
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
between us and them to Claremont only I
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
can tell you like I feel confident if I
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
put out a you know a request for Grant
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
proposals that we would get more than
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
one hopefully um you know and then we
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
could adjudicate them in terms of their
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
alignment with the trust fund
 
01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:08.510 align:start position:0%
alignment with the trust fund
Mission

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
Mission
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I would just add that if the
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
goal is to eliminate the fund the
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund like you can still do the
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
activity you can still if the fund get
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
can't do it don't have the funds right
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
You' have to accept that other income
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
into your
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
budget that otherwise you have to use
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fun fund mechanism so if
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
your goal is to eliminate the fund we
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
have to eliminate funding the underlying
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
but if you eliminate if we eliminate
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
this fund then it just goes away then I
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
can tell you I have other programs in
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
place to support these individuals so I
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
can do it if you want to eliminate I
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
just don't know if you can I you'd have
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
to check no no I don't think you can
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
you'd have to eliminate the legislation
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
spending it down a so is difficult but
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
right now it's just
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
growing right for the NZ I thought you
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
were talking about the other one right
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I I was talking about the
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
vendor fees I don't know I guess we
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
switched off of the vendor uh oh yeah
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the vendor fee the vendor
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
fee program doesn't need to be a
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is all I'm saying yeah
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
but this one does when it is you have to
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
spend years going through the AG's
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
office to get it removed when it's
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
totally useless all right so why don't
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
we just make a recommendation that he
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
tries to uh Grant
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
the the income from this fund yeah okay
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a way to keep it
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
from from grow growing out okay all
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
right special teachers
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
competency um so this fund we're
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
primarily using in support of our
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year program which has
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
actually grown substantively um you know
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
we started we were getting maybe 15
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
applicants a year uh two years ago we
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
had over 300 applicants 100 people
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
finished it out the difficulty is with
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
the growth we also have um you know
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
there's more interest in external
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
support as well so we basically are
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
trying to balance this and then what
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
happens is we know what kind of Revenue
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to get but then we are able
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
to raise other funds to be basically
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
support the program
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and and we don't want to get out over
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
our skis like the program is running
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
really well right now so but so I think
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
you know when I was putting this
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
together there are more activities that
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
we can do with these funds Beyond just a
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year that's how we've
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
been using it so we'll just expand the
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
uses of
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
them so you're getting really good
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue here right I mean you only have
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
200 and something thousand you're
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
getting 20,000 a year of Revenue well
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
that was the year uh well 300,000 we're
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
getting 20 because interest rates have
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
gone up if you go back a little bit we
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
were at to 10 and then we did have the
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
marked Market that took place on some of
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
these funds so yeah but the expenses are
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
yes and mostly because we're generating
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from other sources to offset the
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
programs oh so you're saying teacher of
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
the year spends more than the $5,000
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
this is just what ends up ultimately
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
flowing through I
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
right you can leave those other funds
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
where they are and just draw more funds
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
out of here then or take those donations
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
and put them someplace else yeah yeah
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
but again as a popular program people
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
want to support it
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
so so you're getting donations all the
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
time well we we solicit donations um
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
from commercial companies for this oh I
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
see because vendors are interested in
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
that and do you talk to the teachers
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
colleges teachers teachers
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
colleges um people need it yeah yeah so
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
we we have not we use this only in the
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
DOI area we could push that's what I'm
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
saying there's we could more broadly
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
apply These funds if we wanted to to try
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
to bleed them
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
down yeah you I'm sure we would be able
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
to find you know expanded usage for the
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
funds yeah have an undergraduate
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
teaching fellowship or something
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
something of the year right or or just
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who is the the outstanding
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
student of the year or something you
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
could do that
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay trying not to make it too
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
complicated probably because then right
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't attract the
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
administrative funds um but then as we
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
build the more programs we put in here
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
at a certain point then we're going to
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
say like okay it needs to attract some
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
administrative fees associated with it
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
so far we've not done that
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
gotcha all right other questions on this
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
one a lot of stuff to keep track of a
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
lot of little funds here truthfully like
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
you want to get rid of all these
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
right there are two
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
here that I thought five years ago I was
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to get Mo or three years ago that
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
I was going to get moved to the
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
university system this one was you know
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
quite frankly you can if if this was
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
swept I don't have a need for this fund
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't think we touched the
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
trust funds that are created through
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
Wills I'm not I'm just saying some of
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
these other right we're kind of bouncing
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
around but some of the other
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
programmatic things if you can absorb
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
them you can get rid of the dedicated
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
fun yeah so I don't think we have any
 
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
reason I think she had moved on on
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
special teachers competency fund it says
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
this is a trust fund yes it doesn't Okay
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
so I can't touch that it doesn't say
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
whose trust fund right it was it a
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the the
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
word trust gets used quite frequently um
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
for various reasons but the trusts that
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to are legal will-based
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
trusts that you spoken to the state
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
treasurer about so if it's not that and
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's just dedicated by dedicated fund
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
statute and the underlying legislation
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever you want with it yes
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
s can we find
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
out who's who started this
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
fund whether it belongs to a deceased
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
individual or got be something yeah okay
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah we can look up the history of
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
this RSA right the
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
RSA yeah okay so to sweep that one
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
you'll figure that out okay yes all
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
right good and then when we want to
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
sweep it then we just tell you that we
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
don't need to
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
we have to put it in our bill okay so
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
you need to tell us then what are you
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to do uh within a month or
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
something yeah find something let go
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
through Steve right okay um yeah so can
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
we ask for simultaneously ask for an
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation for Teacher of the
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
Year for getet it yeah I need $15,000 a
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
year for a teacher of the year you can
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
put that in yes in the budget okay
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Harriet Huntress funds Harriet Huntress
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
and hadie Livy it's thing and and you
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
know like so we've not had interest in
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
these we're happy to try and generate
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
interest I think the last time I did
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
this we tried to generate interest and
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get a lot these might be good
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
ones to move over to Keem yeah um I I
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
talked but these are will to the state
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
but can you move them I don't know when
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
the contr controller of the University
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
system was here I informed her about
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
these two and she went away to do
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
something about it she hasn't me yet but
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
I will anticipate that call I follow
 
01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.630 align:start position:0%
I will anticipate that call I follow
with

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
us I think she's now in a different role
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
at the University system she is
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah Chancellor or something Kathy
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
preventure Oren
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
right it was Kathy proventure that met
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
with them a couple years ago it was
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
proventure so was I know so we need to
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
poke her is that the the hadti was a
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
Beque to the state of New State of New
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah so it doesn't have to go
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
to you we could delegate the activity
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
like delegates just clear the funds each
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
year say I've earned $2,500 you can
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
award it as a
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship at those two univer two
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
School period two Education Department
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
of Education Department of Education yes
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
it is so Harry it was Beed to the
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education ah py was just
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
State of New
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah but you should be
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
spending we still could pass through the
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
funds yeah I think you know when we go
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
to look for
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
individuals it's such a small amount of
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
funds that everybody's like oh my gosh
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to be impossible to
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
organize and find a student
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
that can use up the funds yeah but I'm
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
sure the colleges can do it right yeah
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
but again even at the college level like
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
if you're earning you know $2,400 or
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
$4,600 to convene a committee to accept
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
applications and review the applications
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
and decide how you're going to do them
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
after a while it just becomes more
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
difficult than the
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
effort no I just
 
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.910 align:start position:0%
effort no I just
meant

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
meant
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
um if you gave this money to Keen into
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
Plymouth yeah right as a check right but
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
even for them then they like in other
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
words they'd have to plug well they get
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
checks all the time from people right I
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
mean donations but they have to then
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
come back and show us that it was used
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
need because he's a St employee you know
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of student did they talk about
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
and still be responsible for the
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
accounting right yeah like they can't
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
just use it to plow the roads they got
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
they can't put their general
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
fund they have to find a qualified
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
student that ke or
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
Plymouth but they have financial aid and
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
all this sort of stuff they do but then
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
the question is so how does why does one
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
student get it or versus another student
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
like how do they award it
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
and if it's a grant do you then open it
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
up and let people apply for it and then
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
you got to process the applications I
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
just think that's what's I know that the
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
last time I went through this process we
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
had that conversation and we had very
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
little interest for the amount of money
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
in in taking over the responsibilities
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
associated with it this this is already
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
done for the 529 program given out about
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
1,200 per student I mean we're happy to
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
go back to them and see if they have a a
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
already existing scholarship program
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
than this can contribute to yeah yeah
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
and all these colleges get an amount
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
that goes to a endowment fund
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to be used for this 529
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
program okay we can do that right okay
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
so we can do that both for the Harriet
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
as well as the had fund
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
yes we deal with thousands of
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
applications they're already got them
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
stacked up over in treasury what what do
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
they have over there the funds for the
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
529 program that comes from Fidelity
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
right this was this was quite a happy
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing back 28 years ago we had a
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
secretary or we had a Treasurer that
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
gets the law here's a 529 program
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
taxfree parents can put money aside blah
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
blah blah she uh the treasurer makes up
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
an application form sends it to the IRS
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
and says is this acceptable is this a
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
good form just meet all your criteria
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
they put that form on their website so
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
that anybody across the country that
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
went to the IRS to look up what's the
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
what's the tax exempt thing I can put in
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
all went to New Hampshire so only 3% of
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
the money that's in this program comes
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
from people in New Hampshire the other
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
97% is from all over the
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
country and because there's billions
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
that Fidelity is there managing we get
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
125 billion million 125 million a year
 
01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:01.350 align:start position:0%
125 billion million 125 million a year
it's

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
incredible surprise they don't even know
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
where they're sending their but now a
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the other states are doing the
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
same thing so yeah so now now we're
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
number four or number five depending on
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
which level you look at because I think
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Virginia jumped in and of course they
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
give people tax exemption when they put
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
the money in it's tax from the state tax
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
as well as the federal tax so all the
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
other states California New York they're
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
catching on yeah so but some of the
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
people that have already been in our
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
program some of them are allowed to
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
exempt it from their state taxes even if
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
the money goes into program okay but we
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
can find we'll find a scholarship fund
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
to give this to even if it's a third
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
party scholarship fund and we'll just
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
take the income and pass it through to
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
them so if they're already doing it
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
exactly that's what you need is
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure yeah yeah I don't mind
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
giving miss preventure a call and d call
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
Kathy okay yeah
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
all right you'll do it all right I can
 
01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.629 align:start position:0%
all right you'll do it all right I can
all

01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
right it won't change the fund here
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
because we'll still have the fund you'll
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
still have the fund you'll just send
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
them a check once a year you know like
 
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.750 align:start position:0%
them a check once a year you know like
that

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
authority School
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
building so this is basically
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh um you know $8 a day of expenses yeah
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't need it right I mean nobody on
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
the school building authority has ever
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
asked for reimbursement of expenses we
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
still do have a school building
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
authority they still do meet they still
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
do review applications they have driven
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
all over the state but nobody's asked
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
for money all right so this one should
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
be eliminated I think it can kill this
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and where do we put the little bit
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
of money it has and the teacher of the
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
year program that we're also going to
 
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.510 align:start position:0%
year program that we're also going to
kill

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
um that's actually that's actually
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
General funds we could lapse it back to
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
fund 5,000 a
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
year no no 5,000 total well that's B
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
177,000 but we were adding 5,000 in
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
there because we were amping up the
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
building aid program we thought people
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
would be asking for reimbursement but
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
nobody has so right right
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it the 5,000 a year came from
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
your budget somewhere yeah somewhere in
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
our budget I think ah okay it was I was
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
assuming it was General funds and some
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
it is in through the budget process yeah
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
well or probably education trust fund I
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it came through the trust I
 
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
think it just came out of just general
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
appro general fund okay all right good
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
we'll get rid of that one all right
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
teacher certific
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
this is my main fund and this is the one
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
I need this is basically for uh educator
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
lure funds um and we basically on a
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
regular basis are trying to balance the
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
amount of the license fees we've reduced
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
fees and some stuff we just went through
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
a rebalancing of fees because some take
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more effort to do than
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
other ones and we try to keep this thing
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
not you can see we bled it down because
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
it had gotten fairly large and we're
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it just a parody makes
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
Tammy nervous that it's come down she
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
wishes that it wouldn't come down but
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let it come down too
 
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
low but we're not going to keep Point
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
your money that we don't it's not our
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
money it belongs to the licensees
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
so losing teacher jobs every year so
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
fewer teachers licensing yeah although
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's not the case in New Hampshire we
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
have this I mean two years ago we had
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
our highest ever licensure this year
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have our second highest
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
ever licensure really yeah even though
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's not that many jobs um unless we
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
just don't have a lot of the shortage
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
that individual that other states have
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
suffered because we've created a lot of
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways for individuals who
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
are retired or want a second career or
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
career switchers to be able to get into
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
the education profession which has
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
attracted a number of people to get seek
 
01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
attracted a number of people to get seek
licensure

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
so retiring and collecting of Revenue
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else then we pay them yeah but
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
if they but again I mean it's actually a
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
good gig because you have you know
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
people are living longer they want to be
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
engaged and they want to participate in
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
in society and their communities so they
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
can get you know uh they can do that
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
this way Charlie B doing this retired
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
from the Air Force 20 some years into
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
teaching put in enough years to collect
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
to get two P re so normally they just
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
retire from Massachusetts school system
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
and come up here and then tap our school
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
system and then they get two
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
pensions now teachers are required to
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
have bachelor's degrees to be certified
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
or no they are depends on the different
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
certifications have different
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
requirements we also have like a par
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
professional educator certification that
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
requires different stuff so it depends
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
individual educator certification that
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're seeking and what they're
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
required to have many of them require
 
01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:04.709 align:start position:0%
required to have many of them require
master's

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
master's
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
degrees I remember years ago when we
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
talked about the
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
alternative certification we looking at
 
01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
people like guy comes out of the Air
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
Force he went in there became a mechanic
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
he was good at explaining it to
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
everybody else so he he ended up
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
full-time 15 of his 20 years teaching
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
the systems to all the other mechanics
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes the pilots I went
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
through coures for that every time we
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
went through a new airplane here's the
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
hydraulic system this this this and so
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
these guys 15 years of teaching
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
experience some complicated subjects
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
they said why can't this guy get a
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
teaching certificate he's what he's been
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
doing for 15 years and I think some of
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
them were able to do it right well so we
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
have created alternative Pathways so
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
those individuals can get into education
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire which has
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
I mean this year we crossed over a line
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
so we certified more Educators this year
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
through alternative Pathways than
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
through educator preparation programs
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
just because there are fewer younger
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
people choosing to go to the four and
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
five-year college degree route now we
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
have those programs and they're there
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they're supporting kids but there's
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
fewer students available but they're I
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
mean I refer to it as kind of the uh the
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
hidden resource in New Hampshire are
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
retired individuals right we've got a
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
aging population we've got a lot of
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
Brain Trust sitting on the sidelines and
 
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
through these alternative PA Pathways
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
were able to get them engaged in their
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
communities and in helping the Next
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
Generation but but specifically if such
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
a person did not have a bachelor's
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
degree in something or other could they
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
still get certified they can we have
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways for them to be able
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
to do that in fact they do have some
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
pedagogical educational requirements
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we require of them um and it's over
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
a three-year period that they do it so
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
essentially you file a plan you have a
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
mentor which is your super attendance so
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
we make sure these people are effective
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the classrooms and then we put
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
together kind of these bundled course
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
options with Keen with plmouth and with
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
the UNH at the College of professional
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
studies that they go through kind of a
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
depending on what certification you're
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
going to do we've already pre-ordained
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
like if you take this block of courses
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
that will complete your pedagogical
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for your certification in
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
three years but they're working while
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
they're going through that
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
process so are those courses
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
valuable or not uh we hope
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
so well I mean the difficulty is that
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to decide is there a
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
correlation what you find is even
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who come through educator
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
preparation programs do mean that you're
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
a good educator right right um really
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the advantages of the
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
alternative certifications is you put
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
someone in the classroom they have a
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
mentor who's assigned to guide them
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
through that three-year process and you
 
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
know you know this person's going to be
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
effective or this person's not whether
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
or not they've come through the cuz cuz
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
coming through the educator preparation
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
program is not necessarily indicative of
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
someone who will ultimately be a good
 
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.270 align:start position:0%
someone who will ultimately be a good
classroom

01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
teacher okay does mean that they've gone
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
through that certification process now
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
is somebody can be laid off if they're
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
not effective well they would refer to
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
is it's non-renewed and so on an annual
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
basis they generally you know at the
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year they have a
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
contract for academic year and then in
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
April they do the renewals or
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
non-renewals and so individuals who are
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
not successful generally are not renewed
 
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.470 align:start position:0%
not successful generally are not renewed
gotcha

01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've got this problem that the
 
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.510 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've got this problem that the
ending

01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
ending
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
balance is declining no does that have
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
anything to do with having more people
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
in in alternative Pathways that and you
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
charging them less so it does somewhat
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
so there bringing this balance down was
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
a deliberate move um in terms of trying
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
to bring it down we reduce some fees but
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
we did just readjust the fees and we now
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
will be charging more for the
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways because they do
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
consume additional resources and so
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're going to be charging the
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh the amount that those um consume so
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
that I would suspect that this balance
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
that you see here is B pretty much just
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to level out now I think I'm
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable like I didn't I just thought
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
a million dollar sitting on the sideline
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense it's not our money it
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
belongs to the license holders um but we
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
do need some working capital to keep
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
this thing running and so uh we're just
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
adjusting fees to try and keep that
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
balanced I me another thing we
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
introduced recently was uh we're
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
required to do background checks now for
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh individuals and um so we charge a fee
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
for the background check um but we had
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
startup costs associated with that so
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
there weren't a ton initially but now
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's more and so that's reaching its
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
parity in terms of the number of
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
background checks that we're doing uh to
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
pay for the the resources that are are
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
does the revenue and expenses happen all
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
through the year or are they kind of
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
connected to to the school year or
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
something yeah so the renewal is every
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
three years um the licenses renew in
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
June um we've actually done quite a good
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
job uh encouraging Educators to
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
accelerate when they apply for that
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
renewal but certainly a big chunk of it
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
is coming in um you know in the fourth
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
quarter of the fiscal
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
year and then you spend over the whole
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
year you spend over the next year
 
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.629 align:start position:0%
year you spend over the next year
exactly

01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:33.639 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay but you can't get rid of that fund
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
and you
 
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.990 align:start position:0%
and you
don't

01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.149 align:start position:0%
don't
no

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
allate okay Career School another fund
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
so this is you know fee based um so we
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
are required by Statute to license
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
career schools there's a definition of
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
what that is um and again here we have
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
done some work on fee structure to try
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
and minimize that and and not generate a
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
surplus um and we would adjust the fees
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
to try and you know just keep it level
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
set but this is where that activity goes
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
through and is the licensing done yearly
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
or um it depends on the licensure you
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
know that the individual has but I think
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's a annual license that they have
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I don't recall if it's if they
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
might have like a fiveyear license cycle
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure I don't I don't
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
remember I'm sorry
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
is this another thing that oplc does but
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is very different than oplc because
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
this is actually licensure of
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
educational programming yeah um we have
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
tried to minimize the government
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
footprint on this particular program by
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
reducing requirements um down to a
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
minimum in the role that we see
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves and what the legislature has
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
put into the statute is really that
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
we're just uh more of a of a fiduciary
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
role in the sense that
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
um you know if if one of these schools
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
disappears in the middle of the night um
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know so we had changed the rules uh
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know in the law a couple of years
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
ago um focusing on that and requiring
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
the schools essentially we just we
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
requiring the schools to have a shity
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
bond so that if they've collected
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
tuition and they disappear and and I
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if you recall a couple years
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
ago we had a one of the nursing schools
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
um disappeared in the middle of the
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
night and uh and we had a shy Bond and
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
no students were uh you know lost any
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
funds because we basically were able to
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
collect on that Bond and pay off all the
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
students that had paid tuition so all
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
that the students lost at that point in
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
time was time and their educational
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
trajectory because they were halfway
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
through a semester and the school closed
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
down but there was not a financial
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
loss what happened in uh 2023 despite
 
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.550 align:start position:0%
loss what happened in uh 2023 despite
the

01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
expenses just depends probably on the
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
number of um renewals and stuff that we
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
have I don't I don't know the answer to
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
that I can go search that out and and
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
let you
 
01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
let you
know

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay this one does have staff in
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
it right so did it have an extra person
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
for a year or something like that I
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that okay all
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
right but maybe find out yeah I can find
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
out and let you know now at the last
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
sentence here says must meet
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
120% yeah so are you not meeting this
 
01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:30.390 align:start position:0%
120% yeah so are you not meeting this
120%

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that means well
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
generally for the retirement system so
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
when when you have a bunch of employees
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
and you say this is how much the
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
employees cost so we got to put this at
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of the but then they say 120%
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
because the invisible cost of the
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system sort
 
01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
of I don't know the I tend to think this
 
01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
of I don't know the I tend to think this
is

01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing for a long period
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
of time charged more than the cost of
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
the licensing and returned money to the
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
general fund right so before we had oplc
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
if you were a li a doctor we we charged
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the doctors a licensing fee that was
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
120% or
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
125% of the cost of Licensing them and
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
the extra money got went to the general
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
fund so maybe this is something similar
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be charging 120% of
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of Licensing these schools back
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
and lapsing some money back I don't have
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to that yeah we can go find
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
out though I think that a lot of that
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
excess money went to pay went to pay for
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh groups like midwives that weren't
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
producing as much money as they
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
cost well yeah before o opcf that it
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
became more difficult to figure out what
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do about licensing midwives and
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
people like that I mean I don't know it
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
seemed like a lot of this is like where
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
schools like CDL Drivers heavy equipment
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
drivers um you know those folks um sure
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
who's coming through many of these
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
schools yeah does PE ring
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
schools does the higher education
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
commission get paid for out of this no
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
they don't they'll see there's a
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
separate fund associated with with that
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
coming up this is purely the career
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
schools higher education fund has
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
oversight relative to the rules for the
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
career schools um but they they don't
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
collect fees out of
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
us okay all right so we'll we'll look at
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
RSA 188 G col9
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right Orphans of veterans how
 
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.310 align:start position:0%
okay all right Orphans of veterans how
about

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
that this we just award every year it's
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know we advertise it we Regen now
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's there's not these
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
are students in New Hampshire higher
 
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
are students in New Hampshire higher
education

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
institutions that are children of um you
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
that are orphans of Orphans and
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
widows and we publicize this extensively
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh seems like we get one kid you
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
know and they'll stick in there for
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
three years but then we don't find
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else who fits the
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications we have to be a a New
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kid who's going to a
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
university system whose parents served
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and died of a service related injury
 
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.430 align:start position:0%
and died of a service related injury
right

01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not there's not that many of
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
them I see and you're putting 10,000 in
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
your budget every year to we are because
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
we hope that we can keep finding them
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
and okay we award as many as we can find
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
gotcha and the balance keeps on going up
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
because we can't find the kids usually
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
only one person that they find so you
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
might skip a year I found in 23 I had
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
two kids you know but it's only 2500 is
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
the most they can get any correct yeah
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
but it is really flexible Grant in the
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
sense that um like this allows them to
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
pay like we don't limit this to only
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
tuition or something like that so they
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
can pay for books they can pay for their
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
housing they can pay for a lot of
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
different expenses associated with their
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
education it is literally
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
a you know a open and his scholarship so
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it would make sense for us to
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
raise the the amount paid to 5,000
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
instead of 25 I know there'll be some
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
happy kids because the cost has
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
certainly gone up over the years right
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
same for a long time yeah that would be
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
the alternative to cutting the budget
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
amount yeah exactly who would make the
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
decision to make it more than 25000 us I
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
guess it would be you and I would just
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
say if you can say up to would be good
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
because suppose I get like 10 kids all
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
of a sudden right right yeah
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
all right so that's I mean it's probably
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
in is in the some RSA no remember being
 
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
in a group that gave $100 scholarship
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
doing that for 30
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
years so have a grandkid that's that's
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
done this it ain't worth this time 100
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
bucks to write the essay
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
yeah you know got he got to send you his
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
his uh his of his grades and all this
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and get the college to
 
01:31:27.159 --> 01:31:28.350 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and get the college to
send

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
it okay bucks I'm not yeah all right so
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
we could change it to up to
 
01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:36.750 align:start position:0%
we could change it to up to
$5,000

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
$5,000
 
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
$5,000
okay

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah right we've talked about the
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
vending machines
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes um so the next is my higher
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
education sometimes these titles are
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
understand why how why do we um get to
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
inspect out of state public and private
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
institutions is it because a New
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire scholarship student has gone
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
there or uh so if it's just if it's
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
purely out of state we would not be
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
doing that but many schools these days
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
are now offering online programming as
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
well um and that's actually there's an
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
organization called Sarah uh who is
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
charging the fees and circles them back
 
01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:50.750 align:start position:0%
charging the fees and circles them back
through

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
um you know so that was a a change that
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
happened in the OB Obama administration
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
that basically said if you're offering
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
education in those states you have to be
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
approved by those individual states so
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
then some enterprising people created
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
that sah organization to create national
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
accreditation so that's how that process
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
you through um but what happens then is
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
if you're Purdue and you got students in
 
01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:12.590 align:start position:0%
if you're Purdue and you got students in
New

01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you're offering education
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to students in New
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
Nexus so this looks like you're doing a
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
good job of balancing revenue and
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
expenses I mean we have adjusted these
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
fees a couple of times but that's the
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
objective is to just kind of balance
 
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
objective is to just kind of balance
it

01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions good okay next
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
robotics so this is a grant that I get
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and every year
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
we fully awarded and it gets fully
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
expended the only reason that you see
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
any balance is because there's a overlap
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
between the fun I get the funds and then
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
they Grant the funds and then the school
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
use them and then they apply for them um
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
but all the funds 100% of these funds
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been granted and 100% of these
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
used to your point if I need a dedicated
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
fund I don't know if I need a dedicated
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
fund I could run it through an account
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that if it's easier
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
for you all initially it was set up as a
 
01:34:24.199 --> 01:34:25.350 align:start position:0%
for you all initially it was set up as a
dedicated

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
fund I think representative major wanted
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
it that way who did representative major
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay he was the guy who campaigned for
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
that a very popular program I mean I've
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
had you know we I get calls on this one
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
time so expensive equipment and then you
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
see the contest where they go and smash
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
each other they're awesome huh yeah we
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
don't have any smashing contests we try
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and keep is a little bit better than
 
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
and keep is a little bit better than
that

01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
but but it's it's slowly creeping up
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
here right I think it's just like the
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
lapsing of the funds because we do a
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
grant to the school and then they have
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
time to be able to use that if they
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't use it we've got a backlog of
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
schools that apply for them so there's
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
no like 100% of the funds are granted to
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
the schools and we give them a a time
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
frame to when they have to use it by and
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
if they haven't used it and we give them
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know some amount of time so it would
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
kind come up in the beginning remember
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
we just started this in
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
2020 um and so again it's just kind of
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
effect

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
okay so um and we don't charge any
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
administrative fees in this one and
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
people who participate don't pay for
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
things or no uh so describe I don't know
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
what you mean by that students who
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
participate the students are not paying
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
for it um we do require that the schools
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
that receive grants are required to have
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
an industry
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
partner um which generally comes with
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
some type of a contribution or something
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
like that so the teams themselves are
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting additional funds into their
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
teams um but the students themselves are
 
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I've never heard of anybody
 
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
being required to pay gotta
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
right Public School school
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund another um fund that
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
we use consistently and we have a long
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
wait list um if if funds that have been
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
granted have not been used
 
01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:33.550 align:start position:0%
granted have not been used
so

01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
yeah where's the million it's only for K
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
to2 security and internet conne activity
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
as far as I can
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
tell where' they put
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
in keeping it in to us as we spend it so
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
there's also so I was just asking
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
because we got $10 million from the
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
legislature that we ran you know uh an
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
award for and we award it 100% they're
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
not admin services keeps that on their
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
books and then they give us the money as
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
we draw down so it's almost like a G5
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
account with the Fed so I have $10
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
million that we've awarded as well off
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
outside of this and as we expend it then
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
we just draw down the funds from to
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
admin services to reimburse the
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
schools talking about this in Bud go
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
like best of viels with cameras lock
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
doors correct we do access controls
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
emergency alert in and emergency
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
response projects in guns it's is good
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know we want to do this this is
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
non-reactive nobody can just walk in
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully not like I I see these events
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
that happen in other schools and I just
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
say to myself how can that you know what
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
have we done that's going to make sure
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen here walk in with a
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
gun on your on your back or in your
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
hands yeah rifle or they shoot their way
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
in or they throw a brick through the
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
window and break their way in all
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
different kinds of
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
the balance in 2020
 
01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
was didn't you say was it 10 million was
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
it shows a balance here of 12 million
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
544 um that had a beginning balance of
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
16 million yeah remember we started this
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
fund I don't I'm trying to remember when
 
01:38:10.990 --> 01:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
we first started it might have been
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
before 2020 we started with that I think
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
Ken you might remember didn't we get
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
like 30 million I got I got 30 million
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
$29 million initially and then you guys
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
added some more funds to that adding it
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
almost every year and then every year
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
meon four allocations right and yeah I
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
use $10 million of eser funds as well in
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
this yeah yeah so it was you know it
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
make a big deal out and seemed like it
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
almost covered all the schools we we
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
awarded um so when we did the access
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
controls we opened up the Grant and 100%
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the access control applications got
 
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.189 align:start position:0%
of the access control applications got
funded

01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
y so is there still a continuing need
 
01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.030 align:start position:0%
y so is there still a continuing need
after

01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
this year there is I mean we have grants
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
out there that are live that are going
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
to extend another 18 months then we've
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
got a backlog of people so if funds get
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
returned to us then we regant those
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
funds to the schools on the backlog and
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
then I can tell you in my budget
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
submission I'm asking for additional
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
so we could call it instead a public
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure it's really now
 
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure it's really now
public

01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
of a CH to school on
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
Saturday say that again I had a tour oh

classic nice building yeah it's fairly
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
new I thought I thought it would be the
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
old middle school but it's it's a
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
totally different building yeah they're
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
in office space that they converted yeah
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
can Charter Schools apply for these
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
can this one didn't seem to have access
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
to trolls oh they
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
didn't just remember going in the front
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
door he walked right in it's not good
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure I'll call
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
them kind of they haven't got on the
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
list yet they're not a school so they
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
can't apply yet so oh
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right mine's in charge of
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
school what's
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
that but it's in an old regular
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
school all right which is dead manur
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
Advanced manufacturing educ so you all
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
repealed this when we thought in July 23
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
July 2023 okay yeah all right so it
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in the book anymore
 
01:40:36.669 --> 01:40:36.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be yeah we take it out of the
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
book it never got off the ground I mean
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
it was I remember I think it was K
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
Williams who set it up with the idea of
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
trying to get companies to contribute to
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
it well yeah the idea was that that the
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
head of the um New Hampshire
 
01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.750 align:start position:0%
head of the um New Hampshire
Bank

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
Bank
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh Bank
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
Authority was supposed to go out was
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
either was faced with a choice of either
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
you bond this money for us $5
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
million with no security that they'd
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
ever get any money back to pay for the
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
bond or you go out and you find owners
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
so that New Hampshire would present
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
money to the dean Cayman operation so
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
that people around the country would
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
know that we were
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
engaged I was heavily involved in this
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
development okay not in the what how it
 
01:41:42.159 --> 01:41:43.629 align:start position:0%
development okay not in the what how it
ended

01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
ended
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
but but Dean cayman's doing quite well
 
01:41:46.599 --> 01:41:48.830 align:start position:0%
but but Dean cayman's doing quite well
without

01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
it so all right and the other one sign
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
language same thing
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
um it was just established in 2019 yeah
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
again with the idea of some funding
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
coming in but nothing's happened there
 
01:42:00.599 --> 01:42:02.430 align:start position:0%
coming in but nothing's happened there
so

01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um solot is hoping to he wants to
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
do something with it see so we have a
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
new director over vocation
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation Tammy saying who thinks
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
he wants to try and go raise money but
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
right so far he hasn't raised any money
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
so no so you so you want to leave it for
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
cyle yeah we have inactive list I'll
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
come to FAL if I need something it I
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah we don't even have an
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to so yeah
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well you how it is like you have a
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
new guy who comes in and says like I'll
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
use it and then
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
L like right
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
oh um and then there's one that's really
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
strange that doesn't have a 612 or
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything in the statutes
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
a reference to we're going to think
 
01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.189 align:start position:0%
a reference to we're going to think
about

01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
it which one is that the the current
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
ucation and training activities related
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
to Marine trade this is Senator Waters
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and he was specifically focused around
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind yeah and thinking that
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a fee charged to those
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
offshore wind uh development projects
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
that would fund this but nothing has
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
happened yeah apparently in your report
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
you put it at the bottom and you said to
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
be determined by a
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee and the committee hasn't yet
 
01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
committee and the committee hasn't yet
been

01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
created uh um it's a legislative
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
committee but again there's no offshore
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
wind so I don't think anybody decided
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
they need to get together yet so well
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is offshore wind but we aren't in
 
01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
it okay well it's goingon to be hard to
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
fund this then it's going be to collect
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
fees from right all right so we can just
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
take that off of that yeah that
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
just remove that from the spreadsheet
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
and the report I
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
think Dan what
 
01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:05.719 align:start position:0%
we oh rather than removing the committee
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but do we want to include
 
01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.470 align:start position:0%
yeah but do we want to include
[Music]

01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
the the cart which is actually remote
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
captioning I looked it up
 
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.109 align:start position:0%
captioning I looked it up
mhm

01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
so I have a sof spot my heart for
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
interpreters and remote captioners but
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
obviously isn't going anywhere but we're
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
just going to let it not go anywhere for
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
a few more
 
01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.390 align:start position:0%
a few more
years

01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
that all right I've got a column called
 
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
review next year but we haven't been
 
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
doing that we review well we ask for the
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
list every year we only do this every
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
five years right and we do this every
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
five years so um the general thought was
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
to give them five years before we killed
 
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.470 align:start position:0%
to give them five years before we killed
them

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
but well this is five years
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so well so here we are we could
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
we could try deleting it in what we put
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
into the committee and then see who
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
comes and starts saying complaints yeah
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
start saying oh but we're just about to
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
start a fundraising
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
myself and see who s yeah that's right
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
so delete both of these so we only have
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
two three three was already R one's
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
already gone one's already see what else
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
which one is already gone this one the
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
last one but as was said I mean like the
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
vending we could do it through an
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
account we don't have to have a
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund Tammy's okay with that
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
bending um like know words I don't know
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
that I need a dedicated account for that
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
I just need an accounting unit collect
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
money in and push money out that is true
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
but it is revenue so if we have excess
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue at the end of the year I need
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
language in the law saying that it's
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
non-aps otherwise it would be La I
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have authority to keep that
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
revenue on the books it would laps to
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
the general fund well I mean the vending
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems like you're using it
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we are right but again if you
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to if your goal is to minimize
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
funds we could do that in other
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
accounting mechanisms is all I was
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
suggesting so yeah
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know that one seems to have a
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
weird purpose yeah it
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
is a a purpose for maybe eight
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
something I it's a limited number of
 
01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
something I it's a limited number of
individuals

01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah right but they like but it's
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
their career right that's right what
 
01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
they and when you go to get a Snickers
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
bar you're happy that they're doing it
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
all right anything else for Department
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
of Education so you we have a couple of
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
little and school building authority I
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
think you said you were going to which
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
school building author building
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
authority yeah that would be and I'm
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
going to check on the

morning can't
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
