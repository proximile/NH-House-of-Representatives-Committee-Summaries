00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
um some slides that we had shared and i
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
put those up on the screen or if
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
everybody has those available to them i
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
can just walk through those
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh there are two documents that we
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
shared with you one is a powerpoint
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
presentation relative to the budget
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
and then i also prepared a summary of
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
some of the federal
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
funds that we have received and thought
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
i would spend a little bit of time just
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
giving you an overview of those federal
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
funds that we have received
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
in response to covet so mickey i don't
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
know if we want to share the screen or
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of the
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
presentation if they do i can just go
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and start
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh i think it would be better if you
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
shared the screen commissioner
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
you do have the capability commissioner
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
or if tammy would like to share a screen
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
that way you can go
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
to the next slide as you want to do it
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
rather than me uh
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay since i don't have the soft copy of
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the presentation that was sent over i'm
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to let tammy share that or maybe
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
if you have it that would be great
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
all right hold on one sec while i go
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear you no that's
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay tammy if you have it then you can
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
there we go okay so tammy you can
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
when you're ready okay so just for the
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee and i i see
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
many familiar faces on here which i know
 
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.870 align:start position:0%
many familiar faces on here which i know
um

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
many of you understand the department of
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
education kind of understand
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
how we are structured how we're
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
organized um
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
but this will kind of level set us in
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
terms of some of the conversation
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have under the office of the
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner we have a deputy
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then we have
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
four divisions we have starting
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
on my right is the division
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
of educator support and higher education
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
um and this is the division that is
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
principally responsible
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
for activities around educator
 
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.710 align:start position:0%
for activities around educator
credentialing

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
we currently have about 27 000
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
educator credentials that we manage um
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
through a variety of uh technology uh
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
platforms and stuff that we use
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
of those 27 000 educator credentials
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we manage
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
we actually have about just so that
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
nobody gets confused
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
about 14 500 credentialed educators
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
working in our k-12 system
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
so all sometimes there are people from
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
out of state who hold credentials there
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
are many people who hold credentials
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
that are not working in education
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
but just thought it was important to
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
create that distinction for you
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
another aspect of the division of
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
educators support in higher education
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
is responsibility for management of our
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
higher education oversight which
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
includes the higher education commission
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
as well as the council for teacher
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
education which are two governing bodies
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
administer and participate in the higher
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
education commission
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
has a role um as a member of the higher
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
education commission
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is responsible for program
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
approval for
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institutions in the state
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
and then the council for teacher
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
education has oversight responsibility
 
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.150 align:start position:0%
education has oversight responsibility
for

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
our uh rules that uh govern our educator
 
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.509 align:start position:0%
our uh rules that uh govern our educator
credentials

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so that is principally what is
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
managed through that division
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the next division that we have is the
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
division of learner supports
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
and the division of learner supports is
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
larger divisions at the agency and
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
is really focused on what sometimes i
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
refer to as all things kids
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so this includes a number of
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
different programs so including our
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
title programs
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
so this would be title 1 or title 2
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
title 3
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
title 4a title 4b our 21c
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
programs that we've got going so they're
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
managing all of those title programs so
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of financial impact
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
relative to federal dollars that flow
 
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.790 align:start position:0%
relative to federal dollars that flow
through

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that particular bureau the next
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
area that is also included in the
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
division of learner support
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
is our bureau of
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
special education and so this manages
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
again federally funded idea funds
 
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
again federally funded idea funds
principally

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
principally
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
you have a couple of generally funded
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
positions in there but mostly it is
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that is managing the special
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
education activities here in the state
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
supporting all of our special educators
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
across the state who are delivering
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
services on a
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
daily basis the next area that i will
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
for you in the division of learner
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
supports is the bureau of student
 
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
supports is the bureau of student
wellness

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
the bureau of student wellness is
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of different aspects
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
relative to student
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
mental and behavioral health in our
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
school systems and how we might support
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
those students
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
with the belief that as we support
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
students in their behavior and mental
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
health we can get better educational
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes for them
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
and we try to make that our kind of our
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
focus as we work towards that
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
the next theory that i will highlight
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
for you excuse me commissioner
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah representative heath did you have a
 
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
yeah representative heath did you have a
question

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
you commissioner
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
it's very simple could you just
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
differentiate between
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
federally funded and who is um
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
general um budget please
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
i i know you have so many that are
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
federally funded and so few
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
that are are state funded thank you i'm
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
sorry to bother you
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
no problem at all so i'll try and
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
distinguish although what i will tell
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
is that really a lot of times it's kind
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
of a combination
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
so for example if i go to my idea it is
 
00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
so for example if i go to my idea it is
principally

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
principally
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
federally funded but of course we have
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
to manage about a 30 million
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
pool of state funds and we're not able
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
to use federal funds to manage those
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
so we do have two individuals in that
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
bureau that
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
are state funded to be able to help
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
manage some of that
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
that activity in the bureau of
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
student wellness again it's principally
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
through grants from the u.s department
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
or the u.s department of justice but
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
there are i think there are
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
some small amount of general funds in
 
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.949 align:start position:0%
some small amount of general funds in
there

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i could be wrong in that tammy's
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
welcome to jump in and correct me
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
anytime i get something wrong in a
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
budget presentation
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
the next uh you know bureau in the
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
division of learner support that i think
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
is important to bring your attention
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
is the um the bureau of adult education
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
and so this is has a combination of both
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
state and federal funds uh president p
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
just to kind of
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
highlight that for you the state
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
funding in the bureau of
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
adult education is a critical component
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
of matching what is often referred to as
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
our moe
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
or our maintenance of effort and so it's
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
a really important thing sometimes
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's a tendency to want to say like
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
well if we could just reduce the state
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
funds and let the federal funds carry
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
that program we have to bear in mind
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes when we receive federal
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
funds it comes with strings
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
one of those strings oftentimes is that
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
the state maintains a certain level of
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
state participation in the programming
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
so that we can continue to receive those
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um another aspect of the
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
bureau of adult education that i think
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
is important is the role
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
that it plays in the life of
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
high school students principally you
 
00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
high school students principally you
know

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 and 18 year old students but
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes even
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
15 year old students we attract
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
a large number of students from our high
 
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.190 align:start position:0%
a large number of students from our high
schools

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
who are what we refer to as dually
 
00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
who are what we refer to as dually
enrolled

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so these are students who are
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their local traditional high
 
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.310 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their local traditional high
school

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
but they're taking their courses through
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
the adult education program
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they do that because they're
 
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:18.629 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they do that because they're
struggling

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
in their traditional learning
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
environment um and sometimes the
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
struggles is really just and i met with
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of these kids
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
the struggles are around uh just the
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
the size of the school or sometimes as
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
the kids would describe it to me
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the drama of high school they they don't
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
do well with
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
um and they would much prefer to go to
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
class at you know take a three o'clock
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
class in the afternoon and a six o'clock
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
class at night
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know it fits their schedule a little
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
bit better maybe they've got to help
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
take care of a parent at home in the day
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so they are taking kind of these
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
night classes
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
they like the classes because they are
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
then taking classes alongside other
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
adults in the state
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
um those adults tend to be more mature
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
and a little bit more focused because
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
they're coming back for their education
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
and it's just an environment that many
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
of you many of our students in that
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
program find more conducive to their own
 
00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.150 align:start position:0%
program find more conducive to their own
success

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
i only mentioned that because it is a
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
fairly large number
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
um in the neighborhood of about 1400
 
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
um in the neighborhood of about 1400
students

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire are uh you know
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
through that program i often tease
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
um and now bear in mind that that's
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
spread out all over the state right so
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's not in one location
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i often tease uh you know sarah
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
wheeler who is our bureau director
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
our viewer lead there um that she runs
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
the largest high school in new hampshire
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is obviously facetious but it's
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
not but
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
she's doing a great job with those
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
kiddos and we're very happy about that
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner excuse me uh is this what
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:46.230 align:start position:0%
commissioner excuse me uh is this what
the

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
eagle academy in conway falls under
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
or is that a different area
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um the eagle academy or in conway
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
would be one of the adult education
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
programs that we are funding i
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
believe it is yes um
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that would that would be one of
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
those alternative high school
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
options um and then we have some
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
just to represent so that you understand
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
so some of those alternative high
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
connected to an adult education program
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
and some are not right so it's not
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
universal that they're automatically
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
connected i know for people in
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
manchester they've got an alt high
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
school that's not connected to
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh the um you know the adult education
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
programming per se
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
um and then the last area in the
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
division of learner support that i
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight for you
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
is the bureau of career and technical
 
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
is the bureau of career and technical
education

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
so this is the bureau that has
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
all of our career in tech ed throughout
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the state um
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
which is encompassed in about in 27
 
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
which is encompassed in about in 27
about

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
27 career and technical education
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
centers that we have throughout the
 
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.230 align:start position:0%
centers that we have throughout the
state

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
and students are either in what's
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as a
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
sending location or a receiving location
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
so the receiving locations are these 27
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
sites that have
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
special facilities that are designed to
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
be able to provide and support
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
the career and technical education and
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
then oftentimes you have
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
sending schools which are then sending
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
their students into one of those
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
receiving schools to be able
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
so those students can receive the career
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
in technical education
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
we just recently did some work around
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
barriers to access to cpe which i think
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
is an important thing for me to just
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
highlight for you
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
and what you'll find is the way that we
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
are architected in cte
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
if a student is in a receiving location
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
which means that their high school
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
has career and technical education on
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
site there is
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
a significantly higher probability that
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
they will take a cpe class
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
than if a student is in ascending high
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
school and the student has to be sent
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
to that cte center probably the number
 
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:58.470 align:start position:0%
to that cte center probably the number
one

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
barrier that we face is uh schedules
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
and calendars and what that means is
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
just the dates and times and stuff like
 
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.789 align:start position:0%
just the dates and times and stuff like
that

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
so we are working hard to help at least
 
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:12.150 align:start position:0%
so we are working hard to help at least
those

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh you know regionally organized groups
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
to try and coordinate those schedules
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
and coordinate those challenges as much
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
to minimize the barriers to career and
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
technical education
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't seem to make sense that
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you're in if
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're in a receiving location and you
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
have a 65 chance that you're going to
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
take a cte class
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
but if you're ascending location you
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
have less than 10 chance that you're
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
class and we know that you know probably
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
the kids in both places places want to
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
access that type of
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
um of education so that is our division
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
of learner support
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner excuse excuse me don't
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
worry at all yeah
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
um how many uh
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
children are actually being
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
sent to the receiving high schools do we
 
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
sent to the receiving high schools do we
know

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
i can get that information for you we've
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
got a little over 9 000 maybe
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know it depends on with the cove and
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of numbers have been disrupted
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
historically we're running about 9 500
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
students in our cpe programs
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
what i don't know off the top of my head
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
is how many of those are coming from a
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
sending location versus a receiving
 
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.549 align:start position:0%
sending location versus a receiving
location

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
but we can get that information for you
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
or provide that to the committee
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
i i would appreciate that um
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
i assume that the whatever that the cte
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh committee commission
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
is continually working on that area
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of gaining access we are
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to try and find
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
ways to get further access to students i
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
would say that that's our number
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
one barrier to kids gaining access to
 
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.230 align:start position:0%
one barrier to kids gaining access to
cpe

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
cpe
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
is uh the sending receiving model that
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes like and a couple years
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
ago the legislature did
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
create a little bit more flexibility um
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
we used to have
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
a prohibition that a a receiving center
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
was not able to teach
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
academic classes to the student right so
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
if a student from ascending school
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
had to get all their academics after
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
sending school and not at the receiving
 
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
sending school and not at the receiving
school

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
if that created barriers the legislature
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
did loosen that up and
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
allowed mathematics classes to be taught
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
at that receiving location
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
so now you have a student who's coming
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
to cte
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe the barrier was that the
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
math class that they needed in their
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
home school was being offered at the
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
same time as the cpe programming
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
so then they said well you can't take
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
cpe because you don't miss your math
 
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
cpe because you don't miss your math
class

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
but if that receiving school also has a
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
math class that doesn't conflict
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
why not let the kid just take the mass
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
class there while he's already at that
 
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
class there while he's already at that
building

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
so just the more flexibility we have in
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
terms of the programming the easier it
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
is but
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
it gets it becomes more complicated
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
because then everybody's looking at the
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and as you know at the finance
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee the dollar is always
 
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
committee the dollar is always
complicated

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um another aspect of the division of
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
learner support that i just want to
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
point out to you well actually though
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
as always around cte i'll just point out
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
as well cpe is funded primarily
 
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.310 align:start position:0%
as well cpe is funded primarily
federally

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
um to your point sorry representative um
 
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
um to your point sorry representative um
through

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
the perkins grants and uh we do have a
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
um some a smaller amount of uh
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
state funding in the cte operationally
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that we spend there and again it
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
comes with a
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
moe maintenance of effort requirement
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
with the feds
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i will point out that perkins is a
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
particularly onerous
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
grant with respect to moe in other words
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
like every year if you spend if i spend
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't meet my maintenance of effort
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
by one dollar it's like an all or
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
nothing right so if i fail my moe
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
i will lose my eight million dollars of
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh perkins funding that i might receive
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise um and then the other thing
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'll point out about the division of
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
learner support
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
so uh we have been without
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
a uh a division director but we just at
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the last governor council meeting
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh a new division director we finally
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
found somebody and we've nominated a new
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
division director
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh that will be coming in and that will
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
be really beneficial
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
for uh that uh division as well as for
 
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:10.549 align:start position:0%
for uh that uh division as well as for
me

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
who is doing double duty as also the
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
division director for the division of
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
learner support which is a big
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
division so we're excited to have
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
another person on board and joining us
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the next area that i will point you
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
to is the division of
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
educator education analytics and
 
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.190 align:start position:0%
educator education analytics and
resources

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
and this is run by a woman who many of
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know probably on the phone here but
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh caitlyn davis is the division
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
director for this division
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
yeah they're very getting a thumbs up
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
for caitlyn and
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
what i will tell you is in there they're
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
focused principally
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
on all of our data our reporting
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
and our compliance those are the
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
activities that they are principally
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
and what i would encourage each of you
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
to do if you've not
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
been to the department of education's
 
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.669 align:start position:0%
been to the department of education's
website

00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
if you go there and then you scroll down
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the bottom you'll see a link to
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
something called
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
i platform and the i platform is a data
 
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:06.789 align:start position:0%
i platform and the i platform is a data
system

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the department has uh we have tons
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
of information
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
tons of data and through
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
i report and i explore you can access
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
almost everything that you'd ever want
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
to know about education
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
um you know we receive frequent right to
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
know requests
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
um and it is nice to have i platform we
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
launched that platform i think about
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
two and a half maybe three years ago and
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
now we basically just point people to
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
our website because they can get almost
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
every piece of information that they may
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
have been looking for
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
previously um and but it's it's fun to
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
explore you've got lots of information
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
um it's easy to navigate using modern
 
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
um it's easy to navigate using modern
technology

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to work through that
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
the other two important aspects of that
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
division that i want to kind of in
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
addition to the data that i want to
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
focus in on is really some of the
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
compliance and the monitoring
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have two different types of uh
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring that take place in there
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
one is our fiscal monitoring the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman tim carney who runs that
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing that now for a
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
couple of years and this is
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
making sure that our federal grant
 
00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.110 align:start position:0%
making sure that our federal grant
recipients

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
and our you know schools
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
who are the main recipients of that are
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal regulations
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
around those grants that they receive so
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
we do actual monitoring for those
 
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
we do actual monitoring for those
schools

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh we produce reports um i think they're
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
included on the website now if not
 
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.710 align:start position:0%
included on the website now if not
they're

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
going to be included relatively shortly
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to again
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
push more and more stuff out there um
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
and then there's another
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
compliance and accountability area that
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
i think is important to point out and
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh through nate greene and his
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
bureau in that division which is really
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
around school accountability and it's
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
like how are the schools doing in terms
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
of their performance
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh in meeting the minimum standard that
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
we have for education
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
um that is a new activity
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
at the agency um in fact it's just in
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
its design stage
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't previously have funding for
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
that and that was disrupted for some
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
amount of time but we finally put that
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
together so that we can now
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
um be able to do our monitoring for the
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
schools and their compliance
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the minimum standards for education
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
and so we're excited about that
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then the last division that i will
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
make note of is the division of
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
workforce and innovation
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
so this is a division um we do not have
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
a division director
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think that there has been a
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
division director in this division for
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
10 years um and it
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
um so it runs you know kind of just as
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
two bureaus really
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and those two bureaus are and it runs
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
under the office of the deputy
 
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
under the office of the deputy
commissioner

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
um but those two bureaus include uh
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
vocational rehabilitation as many of you
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
know we run the vocational
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation for the state
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh serving our uh individuals
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
ages 14 through through whatever age
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
they reach
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities to help them
 
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.149 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities to help them
secure

00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
secure
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
employment and that is
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
one of the activities that we have here
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
and then the other activity that we have
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
and you'll see this in our budget
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
request this year relative to physicians
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
is we run the social security disability
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
administration so we basically
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
are the federal government the federal
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
social security administration
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
outsources two states responsibility for
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
adjudication of
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
disability determination and appeals
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
process around disability determinations
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and so we have an organization
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
that does nothing but that work right
 
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.350 align:start position:0%
that does nothing but that work right
now

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and that is part of this division
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
of workforce
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
and innovation so um that's pretty much
 
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.269 align:start position:0%
and innovation so um that's pretty much
an

00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
overview of the agency and while those
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
are kind of the
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
functional things i'm seeing who did
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know organization chart but where
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
are you uh but then we also have
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
our uh office of business management omb
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
opposite ovm or yeah opm office
 
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.789 align:start position:0%
opposite ovm or yeah opm office
management

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
um which is run and headed up by kenny
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
vallencourt who is on the call and is
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
our chief financial officer
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and tammy has an organization that is
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
all of the budgetary the finance and
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
really kind of uh
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
finance intellect intellectual intellect
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
what am i saying here business analytics
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
relative to a lot of the the work that
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
we do here at the department
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
um and so she is also there it also
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
houses our
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
human resources function and then as you
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
know one of the other things that you
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't see on here that you might
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
typically see it we don't have an
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
information technology department
 
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.390 align:start position:0%
information technology department
because

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
that is run by doit and so that's the
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
department and i will pause there i
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
realize that i've given you kind of a
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
of a big overview there but let me pause
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
and just see if there's any questions
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
for some of the members who maybe were
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
not as familiar with the
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
agency uh representative heath you had a
 
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.909 align:start position:0%
agency uh representative heath you had a
question

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes please um thank you uh commissioner
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
um bulk rehab had a lot of issues during
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
the last budget cycle
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i know that there's been an audit i
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
haven't read it all yet
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
but could you just speak to is that all
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
been cleaned up and
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
and there's not a problem anymore so
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to is
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
um in december of 17 we put in some
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
financial controls and we discovered
 
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.789 align:start position:0%
financial controls and we discovered
that

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
the bureau was overspending um and we
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
ended up in an
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
order of selection so we have moved out
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
of the order of selection
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative i would not say that
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're out of the woods there are a
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
number of internal control deficiencies
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
that need to be corrected over there
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly it's outside of the
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
sweet spot of a lot of the people there
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
so it is not
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
an easy task for them to make some of
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
the changes that need to be made
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
but we did just have that audit report
 
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.510 align:start position:0%
but we did just have that audit report
it's

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out a number of areas that need
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
to be corrected and we are in the
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
process of now
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
we were correcting them before and we're
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
continuing to correct those deficiencies
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
so worth keeping an eye on thank you
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i just want to say
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm very pleased to see how well
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
automated you have created so many of
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
those areas that were long overdue
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
in getting into a digital form so i
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you have a question
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair uh commissioner
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i was
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
um i uh have to say i was i was
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
surprised when i heard you
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
say that um d.o.e is
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
is uh i guess the right word would be a
 
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.909 align:start position:0%
is uh i guess the right word would be a
delegatee

00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
delegatee
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
from the social security administration
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
to make disability determinations
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question is um
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
do you do that generally even for
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
you know like in other words if let's
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
suppose there's a 55 year old man or
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
woman who who is claiming uh
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
that they're disabled do you do those
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
determinations for them or is it only of
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
certain people of a younger age
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's my first question and my second
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
question is does the
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
does the federal social security
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
administration reimburse the state
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
for your services yes so
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh i'll i'll go in reverse order so yes
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
they it's fully that and i didn't answer
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
that question sorry about
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
repeats i didn't answer that that is a
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
100 federally funded
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
there are no general funds in there uh
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
so basically they pay us for
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
all of the costs and it's pure pass
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
through associated with that including
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know our our uh overhead rate that
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
we what we pass through there as well
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
um and the work that we do so
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
bear in mind that the uh social security
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
administration itself
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
has social security offices they're
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
meeting with clients
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
so ours is really a behind the scenes
 
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:06.710 align:start position:0%
so ours is really a behind the scenes
activity

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
where we have an office of people who
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
are receiving
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
medical records and files and really
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
making adjudications
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
principally on appeals so somebody gets
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
a determination from the social security
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
administration that says you don't
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
qualify and they appeal that
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
that might get referred to our team uh i
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
think we have
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know a number of doctors on contract
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that we work with
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh that are looking at those and just
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
making determination so we are really
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
just a back office operation
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the social security administration
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
why it's located in the department of
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
education i'm not sure when i first
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
arrived here i
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
do have the same kind of curious
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
question like how does that have to do
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
with education
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know apparently this is
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
an arrangement that you know dates back
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
at the federal level for some amount of
 
00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:53.590 align:start position:0%
at the federal level for some amount of
time

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
through the doe and that's why it's here
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to go to my next
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
slide excuse me just second
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
are there are there any other questions
 
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
are there are there any other questions
from

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
anyone on the organization
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
and what each of the
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none go ahead commissioner
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay a little bit to the next slide and
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
um you know i don't know how all of the
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
other agencies necessarily put together
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
the budgets i know you guys all have
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
your budget books
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
but this document
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think is helpful because it puts it
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
all in one place and just makes it
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
really easy to kind of understand and
 
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.590 align:start position:0%
really easy to kind of understand and
see

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
kind of what's happening on an annual
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
basis relative to
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
um you know education the funds that are
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the funds that are going out so that
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
you get to see it
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
i have it organized first through
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
general funds and then you'll see past
 
00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:01.909 align:start position:0%
general funds and then you'll see past
which

00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
includes you know our general fund
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
stated our general funds passed through
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
the general fund salary
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have the education trust
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
fund as well that you'll see there
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
and then what you'll see is i don't know
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
if i'm able to circle this
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
you have the revenue at the top so we
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
are funded through general funds
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
um and these are the general funds that
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
really focus on
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
what we spend at the department level
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
in order to support services and i'll
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.310 align:start position:0%
in order to support services and i'll
describe

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
describe
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
each of those in detail for you the next
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
thing you see is the federal funding
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to support education
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
about 223 million 255
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
million there are some additional funds
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
this year that you will see coming in
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain those separately
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh you then have the education trust
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
fund which is contributing
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
as well as some other funds which could
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
be whether that's credentialing funds or
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
other types of fees that will come in
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and those are the revenues that we
 
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
um and those are the revenues that we
receive

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
and then and then you'll see there's
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
another line item there we don't have it
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
for 21 because it's not been put in
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
but it's just the local education
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
spending but again just trying to give
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
you kind of a big picture
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
perspective of what does it look like
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
and this is almost a p
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
l for education in new hampshire and
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have this document
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
um and then i've also just included for
 
00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
um and then i've also just included for
everyone

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
some basic enrollment information and
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
the state per pupil cost
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know which is a computed number
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
based on a formula
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then what you'll see on the next
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
line down if you see total general funds
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
um you know so our budget last year was
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
25 and 27. there's a specific project in
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
that jump in there that you'll see
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
coming out this time and then the in the
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget is
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
23 452 which represents
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
the target that the governor gave us
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh manage the budget so
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh the way for those of you knew in the
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
process uh we received a budget target
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
from the governor and then we try to put
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
together a budget based on what that
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
target is and how we might deliver on
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
that budget
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so just walking through some of the
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
programs that we have
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
and highlighting a couple of things um
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know the first one i think you'll
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
see is so here's our our state aid
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
general and you'll see the different
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
components that make this up but
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
um the the things i kind of wanted to
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
point out here
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
is you'll see we had a dropout
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
prevention program that was started a
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
years ago under governor lynch
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
and it was grants that were made to
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
districts to
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
respond to what at the time about 10 or
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
12 years ago
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
was some relatively significant dropout
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
issues in our school system
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
um i think about you know as we were
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
going through and trying to prioritize
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
and looking at the various programs in
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
what uh you know we you know where we
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
were with those programs and what might
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire uh has
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
has significantly addressed its dropout
 
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.670 align:start position:0%
has significantly addressed its dropout
prevention

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the state we are one of the top
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
states in terms of
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
graduation rates for our students we
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
have done things both at the legislature
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
as well as the local school district and
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
at the department
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
to minimize the effect of dropout
 
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
to minimize the effect of dropout
program

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know some of which is not the least
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
of which is you know our adult education
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
programs that we talked about earlier in
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the organization to try and
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
create pathways for these students
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that they don't drop out we find an
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
educational pathway that they can plug
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
into and we can get them through and
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
across the goal line of a high school
 
00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
across the goal line of a high school
diploma

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
so as we prioritize so this is one of
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
the items that came
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
out of our budget and that's what i'm
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
pointing that out to you here
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and again so it's been about around for
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
about 10 years
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
one might argue that it has done its job
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
improvements relative to the performance
 
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
improvements relative to the performance
there

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
some of the other these are some
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
relatively minor things that we took out
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
but in our career and technical student
 
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.589 align:start position:0%
but in our career and technical student
organizations

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
so in our different programs whether
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's the automotive program or the
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture programs where the
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh the machining program uh we've got
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
different clubs and sports
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're kind of like sports but they're
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
little clubs that kids organize around
 
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
little clubs that kids organize around
for

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
their different cte programming and we
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
have always provided
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
support to those and we will continue to
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
provide support
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh but we may not get to have pepperoni
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the pizza this year
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
um if we have to reduce the spending
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
and those so that's one area that we've
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
looked at um
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know excuse me excuse me
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.310 align:start position:0%
you know excuse me excuse me
commissioner

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm looking at this correctly uh
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
you did not fund tuition and
 
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.589 align:start position:0%
you did not fund tuition and
transportation

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
is that the cte program or is that
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify for you that so what
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're pointing out is
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess you can't see my screen but
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
the two lines above that
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
7.4 million and the 33 million that
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
had had amounts in 2019 in fiscal 19 and
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
timmy if you have your mouse and you can
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
circle the numbers as i'm talking about
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
that might help
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
everybody so in 2019 we had um
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see the 33 million
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
building aid and then you had tuition
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and transportation for
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
7.4 million those items
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
in the last budget were moved out of the
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
operating budget and into the education
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why you see nothing after that
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that we haven't done
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
building aid it's just that they changed
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature last time changed the
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
accounting for those and moved them down
 
00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
accounting for those and moved them down
below

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna see those then down
 
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna see those then down
below

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i didn't realize that i
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
yep um so they came to the trust fund
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
some other areas that i just want to
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
highlight that in terms of programming
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
as well as we were working to
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
manage this is that the national
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire scholars program which
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have funded in our last budget cycle
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
is not funded in this budget cycle the
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
dual inconcurrence
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
is which was funded in the last budget
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
cycle is not funded and i'm going to
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
pause for a minute i'll talk about that
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
in a moment and then also the robotics
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we funded in the last budget cycle
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
didn't fund in this budget cycle
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to bear in
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
mind that some of these so for example
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
the with the pandemic we didn't spend
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
much of that
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh second year of uh robotics anyways
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
um much of the programming there was
 
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
um much of the programming there was
disrupted

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
disrupted
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the budgeting process relative to the
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
so the way that this program works is
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is dual and concurrent
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
fees that are paid for students who are
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
taking classes in their high school
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then if those students want to
 
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.109 align:start position:0%
and then if those students want to
receive

00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
a community college credit for it
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
then they the student can apply for
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
and get college credit and the
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
department of education will pay 200
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
up to well i think a minimum of 250 to
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
the community college so that those
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
students will receive credit
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
so a couple of aspects of this program
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget process that i think are
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
important to consider
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
one is it didn't really make sense
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
for me to be the processor of those
 
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
for me to be the processor of those
funds

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh in effect these are students who are
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking and earning college credits so
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
there was not really a need for me to
 
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.190 align:start position:0%
there was not really a need for me to
administer

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
because essentially what was happening
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
is i would get a bill from the community
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
college and i would send them the money
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're like well why would you
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
send us the money like for me to send it
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
why not just fund it directly to the
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
community college to offer that
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
again an administrative efficiency in
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
that process
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then the second aspect of this that
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
i think is important to consider
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
is you know what is you know the
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
is already is offering these these
 
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
is already is offering these these
courses

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
but just to describe so we have the
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
running start courses
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
so a running start course is taught at
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
the high school
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
by a high school teacher and so
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
essentially you have one of my high
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
school classes is taking place
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
i got a high school teacher who's going
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
to teach the class whether or not
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
running start takes place
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they're teaching the kids who are
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
there it's only if the kid want if the
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
student wants to claim credit for that
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
that the community college gets involved
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and their involvement
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
and i may be understanding this so you
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
may want to check with them as well as
 
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:30.710 align:start position:0%
may want to check with them as well as
they

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
have a perspective on this um but
 
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.069 align:start position:0%
have a perspective on this um but
they're

00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
assuring that the teacher my high school
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
teacher who's teaching the class
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
has the credentials generally a terminal
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
degree in that subject
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be a terminal master's degree in that
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
subject to be able to teach it for
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
college credit
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
so for example if i'm teaching a math
 
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.870 align:start position:0%
so for example if i'm teaching a math
class

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
and the teacher there has a bachelor's
 
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.309 align:start position:0%
and the teacher there has a bachelor's
degree

00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
in mathematics and they're teaching that
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
math class
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible to
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
to earn high school credit in that class
 
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
to earn high school credit in that class
because

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
that teacher isn't qualified at the
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
collegiate level at the post-secondary
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
level to teach that class
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
if that teacher however has a terminal
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
master's degree in mathematics
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
then they are eligible to teach the
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
class both for high school as well as
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
for college credit
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
and therefore it enables those students
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
to both earn
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
high school credit and college credit on
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
a go-forward basis
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
um and so the question becomes when the
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
when the community college is awarding
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
those credits
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know what is the cost of awarding
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
those credits to the college
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
so something that we can look carefully
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
at as we're working with a skinny down
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
budget here
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the other program that the
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
community college offers is the dual
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh which is basically allows students in
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
high school to take classes
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
at the community college so those
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
students are going to community college
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
and getting those
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so they are also reimbursed through
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
this program for those
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
students and so again um
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know the thinking is that this is
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
probably more of a community college
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
program than it is a department of
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
education program
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
since really we are simply the conduit i
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
receive the money from the legislature
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then when i get an invoice from the
 
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
and then when i get an invoice from the
um

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
the uh the community college i send the
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
money over to them
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
it might be easier to just fund directly
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the community college
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that there is a problem
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21 relative to this in that
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh the community college has used up
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
all of the funding so this funding has
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
been 100 basically exhausted
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
in this budget cycle and so we don't
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
have appropriation
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that they do have
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation so it's something that we
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
can work through in terms of deciding
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
how we want to manage this program on a
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
go-forward basis because we
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
certainly want to make sure that our
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
students have the opportunity to earn
 
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
students have the opportunity to earn
those

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know post-secondary credits
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
through that high school experience
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's some ways to do
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
that um i see a number of hands going
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
out so i'm going to just pause and
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
without a conversation i get it okay
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative bucco uh
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
you had a question yes thank you madam
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you commissioner for
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
presenting today and and uh
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you to uh tammy and caitlyn for
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
supporting this call
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
um you when when you were talking about
 
00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
um you when when you were talking about
um

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
transportation you mentioned that it had
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
been transferred
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund and then
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund on page 1293
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
is itemized as building aid adequate
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
education aid
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation aid charter
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
school tuition and
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
special education aid and then on the
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
next page that's all
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's all bundled onto other so
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
which one of those things are new and is
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
that that other
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
is itemized all those things are now in
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
right so representative what i'll do is
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'll stick with this spreadsheet and
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
then i'll have tammy get the actual
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
reference on the page
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
but if you look further down and maybe i
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
should have just done this if you take
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
the 20 column
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you go down towards the bottom of the
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
page you'll see we have the category
 
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
page you'll see we have the category
called

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and then we
 
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.069 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and then we
enumerate

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
enumerate
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
all of the item there and so what you'll
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
see is
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
that if you look at building aid for
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
example it's at 38 million 500 000 right
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
so there was nothing last year but now
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
you have the 38
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
538 million 500 000 in there if you look
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
at the line
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
under tuition and transportation you had
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
zero in fiscal year 19
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you have 9 million in fiscal 20 9
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
million and 21
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
9 million and 22 and 9 million and 23.
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that is where those funds have been
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
transferred to
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
is that i don't that helps everybody to
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
see how we just took them out of those
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
two line items up above and we moved
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
them down below
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you i didn't see that
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
earlier thank you
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
no problem okay
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
were you finished tom yes yes thank you
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay sorry representative heath
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um we did i
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
remember clearly we did that last year
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
we had an excess in the trust
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed more appropriate for
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
those funds to be
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
there and i think it makes a lot of
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
sense i am really upset
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
about dual enrollment that 7 000
 
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.589 align:start position:0%
about dual enrollment that 7 000
students

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that participate in the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
um that's something that i hope
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
this committee will think about um
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
adding back in um commissioner would you
 
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.109 align:start position:0%
adding back in um commissioner would you
be

00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
adverse to that no i don't
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
have any problems supporting it the two
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
things that i would tell you is
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably more efficient if we just
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
fund the activity at the community
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
college right
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then and then instead of paying
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a fee
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
because if you think about it i think
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
what we have to think about this
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative heath is
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
like so what is the correlation between
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
between 250
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
a student and a kid getting the college
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
credit really what we have to figure out
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
what does it cost the community college
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
to administer
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
a program to qualify the high school
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
teachers so that they're eligible to
 
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
teachers so that they're eligible to
teach

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
teach
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know what is the incremental cost to
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the community college when you stick an
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
extra kid in a class right
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
they got you know 18 kids in a class and
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
then a high school kid shows that makes
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
it 19.
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
is it 250 or what is it so it just seems
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
that the appropriate place to make sure
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
that we create these seamless systems
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
for those kids
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
might be better at the community college
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner my other question
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
is about the state scholar program for
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
years we've really encouraged
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
people um our high school juniors and
 
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.550 align:start position:0%
people um our high school juniors and
seniors

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
seniors
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
to look at taking those really rigorous
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
courses and
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
and to be um noted for their achievement
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
in them
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
um can you just talk to me about why
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
that disappeared
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it was so you know as well that i
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
have been an advocate for the new
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire scholar since i got here i
 
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:11.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire scholar since i got here i
love

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
love
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
setting a high bar for kids and letting
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
them get there um i didn't get it i
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
think in the last budget cycle i got
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
funding for it in this budget cycle and
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
as you know scott powers was
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
administering that for us
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
that got disrupted during the pandemic
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
um you know but in terms of so it is a
 
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.190 align:start position:0%
um you know but in terms of so it is a
program

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
that is fairly mature has good
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
governance in the sense that it has a
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
good board of directors that's
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing it
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so maybe a little bit not like the
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
dropout prevention program that
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
has done its work you know unfortunately
 
00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
has done its work you know unfortunately
uh

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire scholars it feels
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
like it's in relative to all of the
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
various programming that we have
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
like they feel like they're in a pretty
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
good place right like we've got we got
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
now like over 5000 kids a year
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
who are doing this the schools
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
almost all of our schools are
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
participating in it um
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that you know you try to
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
figure out where can you have the least
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
disruption right and so that's really a
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
value that we were trying to to make
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
and yeah like so representative just
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
like me you can look down this line of
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
columns right we say like okay how do i
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
get to this number and
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
if i take if i put 100 000 back in here
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
where do i want to take it out
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying so that's
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
really what we're doing
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
um just one uh quick final question
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
um do you have just off the top of your
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
head a total number of general
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
funded positions in the doa i do in fact
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
let's just
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
do that i have it on my i don't know
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's coming up on a
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
slide or i'll have it i haven't even on
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
here or something
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
we can absolutely get that for you we
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
can do that thank you yeah so
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
actually can we go to oh and actually
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
the only other point i'm going to point
 
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:51.990 align:start position:0%
the only other point i'm going to point
out

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
is so we do have fiscal year 20 i had a
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
4 million dollar and 4 4 million 124.21
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and then you'll see actually you know
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the 4 million it goes from in 2021 it's
 
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
the 4 million it goes from in 2021 it's
doit

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
doit
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
red phone and other i go from 2.5
 
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:09.990 align:start position:0%
red phone and other i go from 2.5
million

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
to 4.7 million and then i'm down
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
a significant amount and this is our
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
student information system
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we just couldn't sustain in the
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
budget and so with that i'm going to
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
just turn slide and talk a little bit
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
about the student information system
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
so commission yep commissioner before
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
you do that i have a follow-up on the
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
scholars program
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead okay so you are not
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating the scholars program but
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
rather what you're doing is
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh the program will continue
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
it's just that there won't be anything
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
at the at doe to support it is that
 
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
at the at doe to support it is that
correct

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
exactly so we have a we work with the
 
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:58.150 align:start position:0%
exactly so we have a we work with the
nhcuc

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
nhcuc
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
we had a contract with them to
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
administer the program
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
and so we are not able to support an
 
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.910 align:start position:0%
and so we are not able to support an
administrator

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
for that program through the nhcuc
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
anymore but the program itself
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
exists there is a board of directors
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
they are continuing to run it
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
the question is should that now spin off
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you know among the hundreds
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
of schools that are participating in
 
00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:24.790 align:start position:0%
of schools that are participating in
that

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
maybe if everybody were to kick in a few
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
dollars they could support the
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
administration of that program which we
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay okay so let me jump on
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't want to
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
go over my time because i know you have
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
other hearings too
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
so the statewide information system is
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
something that i have been advocating
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
for for four years i'm gonna keep
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
advocating for it
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is really a system that allows
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh this is really a system that allows
us

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to a couple of different things improve
 
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.549 align:start position:0%
to a couple of different things improve
efficiency

00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are literally spending across the
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
state whether it's at the department
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
or in the school districts man months
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
maybe men years of time
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
trying to input data into various excel
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and various systems that
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't talk to one another
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
but exporting information out of one
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
into another
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
system and it's just it's an incredibly
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
inefficient way to do it
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
the second aspect is that it makes it
 
00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:22.150 align:start position:0%
the second aspect is that it makes it
difficult

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes i get requests for
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
information from the legislature
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
can you let me know about this or let me
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
know about that and we simply don't have
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
a statewide information system that
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
allows us to look across those students
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
and get the information that you want to
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
know and so
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we are reduced to you know
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
surveys to the districts
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
which again there's more manual man
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
months of time people trying to collect
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
information again
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
for ad hoc reports and stuff like that
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then the third
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
is that we have a data security risk in
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
our state because of
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
some of the disparity we have relative
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the various systems across the state
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to improve our
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
data privacy data security through
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
a statewide information system and just
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
this does not mean that the state is
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
running the data systems for all of the
 
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.630 align:start position:0%
running the data systems for all of the
districts

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
as much as it means the state has a
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
overlay system that allows
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
us to gain access to the information
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know the school can shut up and keep
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
the information that they need
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
but i get to get the information that i
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
need so it just improves the efficiency
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
across the state in terms of student
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
information and reporting
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and so that this is one of our
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that did not make it
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
into the budget but i will continue to
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
advocate for if you find that you have
 
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:36.790 align:start position:0%
advocate for if you find that you have
room

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
and then um i just want i'm going to
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
flip over to the next
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
slide excuse me okay
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative heath has a question oh
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the statewide student
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
information system
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
data warehouse in the past
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
that information was uploaded from
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
now are you saying that you'll have the
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
capacity to go in
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
and take the data that you need at the
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
local school district level
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so what we'll actually be able to
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
do is all of those
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
man those uploads happen manually
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what's happening is the
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
is exporting a cvs file or an excel type
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
of a file from
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
their local system and then
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
uploading that to my system and then i
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
import that into my data warehouse
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
what this will do is allow us to have an
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
automated link so the reports that need
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
to come
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
automatically are exported from their
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
system to my system as opposed to going
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
through that multi-step
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
risk of error type of a process is that
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
a security issue
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
i remember my good friend neil kirk and
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
he might be concerned about this
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
so actually neil kirk would be happy
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
about this but what it will do is it
 
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.589 align:start position:0%
about this but what it will do is it
will

00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
minimize the security risk because what
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
we can do is we can create
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
an actual secure transfer of that data
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to now what you've got
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
is kind of these open files of a cvs
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
file or an excel file
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
that is then being uploaded so all of
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
those different transactions from one
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
system to another to another to another
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
every one of those creates a
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerability for that data
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
whereas in it with a some type of a
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
student information system we'd be able
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
to minimize that
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
and eliminate that risk and one more
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
sacid has been the means by which
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
you get that information um
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
will you continue with this acid you
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't go
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a student's name or address or any of
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
that information do you
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
no all of that same data architecture
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
stays the same
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
all we do is we eliminate all of these
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
risky manual processes
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to do but the sas
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
it still remains the primary key
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
indicator for the students and
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have any additional information
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
right like the information i'm getting
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
today is the same information i get in
 
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.270 align:start position:0%
today is the same information i get in
this

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
in a student information system but i
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
get it through an automated process not
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
a manual process
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
so the school district madam chair if i
 
00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
so the school district madam chair if i
could

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
ask one more question please no problem
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
um so the student information is um
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
secure at the school district level
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
and you are only having access to
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
certain things
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
that you have received in the past
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
correct so the school district will
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
define like
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay here's all the information that's
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
ours here's the three pieces of
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
information that belong to the
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
so we will build a technology bridge so
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
that i get to get that information but
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
not the others
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh i think we're
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to have a
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
a little longer discussion on this
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
area because um
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
i know that the school systems have
 
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.630 align:start position:0%
i know that the school systems have
spent

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on automating
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
all of this information and i guess we
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
just need to understand
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
how you are going to
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
interact with the the various
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
databases that the the schools are
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
currently using because
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
it is not uniform across the state i
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
think as we
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
probably all know that's what we're
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
trying to do we're looking for
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
a system that is an overlay so i don't
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
care what system the school has
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
but i have the ability to do kind of api
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
bridges to be able to connect to that
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
data and pull up the information that we
 
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
data and pull up the information that we
need

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
so representative lynn you had a
 
00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:37.430 align:start position:0%
so representative lynn you had a
question

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh no thank you madam sure but the the
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner answered it in response to
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath's question thank
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
you so timmy jump to the next slide
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to do three minutes left
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
and i can and i can run over if the
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee can
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay so here is these are our positions
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
we currently have 287 positions tammy
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
can you jump in and tell me how many of
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
generally funded i'm going to guess it's
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
about 50 or 53
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have it on my life how
 
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:04.710 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have it on my life how
many

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
63 63 okay so 63 of those are generally
 
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.670 align:start position:0%
63 63 okay so 63 of those are generally
funded

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
we are requesting seven new positions uh
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
two of those will be
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
but they're all federally funded two of
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
those are the charter school grant that
 
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.270 align:start position:0%
those are the charter school grant that
you

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh that i've received and they are paid
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
for through that charter school grant
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then we're doing such a great job
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
for the social security
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
disability administration that they are
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
asking us to do more work
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
and want to fund an additional five
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
positions in that
 
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
positions in that
bureau

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
and then i have one other just
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
these positions are in fact already in
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
correct okay and out of that
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
the seven are all federally
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
funded so it's not nothing that will
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
have an effect on
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
um the general fund budget that's
 
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
um the general fund budget that's
correct

00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative bucco i see that you
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i have a question
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
charter school grant i thought it was
 
00:58:14.559 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
charter school grant i thought it was
only

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
it was going to be 10 million this year
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
but in the budget i see where um
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
charter school federal grants are posted
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
at 27 million
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
so it would be it's 10 years 10 million
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year that we're in right
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
now but then your budget is gonna
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
again looking forward to my
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
22-23 and so it would be 27 million
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
during that period of time
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
it would be say that again please i'm
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
sorry so the total grant
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
is 46 million yes i understand
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
i've gotten 10 of it
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to add in this next budget
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
cycle 22.3
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
27 million and then when i get to my 24
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
10.

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
10.
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um well the 27 million was what i was
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
questioning i thought that would be 10
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
for next year no so it's 10 this year
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's 27 million because basically i get
 
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:15.750 align:start position:0%
it's 27 million because basically i get
to

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
move forward with that 46 million so i'm
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
going to move forward
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
in that next biennium budget with 27
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
because over that full period i have to
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
spend all 5 million
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
so the initial toronto game was 10 then
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think i have
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know a 12 and a 15 trunks is the
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
next branches that i get from the
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh the feds relative to that grain so
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're just budgeting what the grant
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
what the federal grant awards to us is
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
what we have budgeted
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you i i have a
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
are you are you able to spend are you
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
able to um
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
spend that federal grant to uh improve
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
existing schools so
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
existing schools are eligible to apply
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
for those grants
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
because existing schools are eligible to
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
become charter schools or they can start
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
a charter school and we have a number of
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
districts who are
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
looking at kind of alternative academies
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
or some type of thing that they want to
 
01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
or some type of thing that they want to
do

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
and so they absolutely are able to apply
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
would that be ex charter schools kind of
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
public schools that are already existing
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
so existing charter public schools may
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
also apply
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
for those grants as an expansion grant
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
or a replication grant
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative lynn you
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes my only
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
question was with regard
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the new positions that you indicated
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
um all seven would be federally funded
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess my only question is is this
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
i know that it sometimes federal
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
programs say okay
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're gonna fund these we're going to
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
fund something for a few years
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
and then after a few years the state's
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
on its own and i'm just wondering
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
is this that kind of federal funding so
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think so so the two that you
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
have there so the charter school grant
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
we know that's a discrete grant
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
so they've not made a long-term
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
commitment other than the 46 million
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
grant that i have we know that it runs a
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
fixed period of time and at the end of
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
that grant these two positions will go
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
away because i don't have
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
that grant funding to pay them uh
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
relative to the disability determination
 
01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
relative to the disability determination
they

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
have this is the second time since i've
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
been here that they've expanded our
 
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
been here that they've expanded our
mission

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of the scope of work that we're
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
providing to them
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
um if they were to cut back and say like
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to give you less
 
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:38.950 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to give you less
funding

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
then we would have to uh do a layoff in
 
01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:42.470 align:start position:0%
then we would have to uh do a layoff in
that

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
bureau and reduce the number of
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
employees that we have in there
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
because we can only hire what we have
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead and so i guess my um
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
my only question on that is when when
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
you have this kind of situation where
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
let's say let's take it with the for the
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
charter schools you have a grant
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the from the feds for a certain
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
period of time um
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
are when the people are hired to fill
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
are are they do they become sort of
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
regular state employees or are they told
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
look you're you know you're we're hiring
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
you but you're only going to work for
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
three years or four years and then this
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
grant is going to be over and you know
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
there's um your job is going to be
 
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
there's um your job is going to be
eliminated

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's actually kind of a both end
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
so when we
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
hire them we tell them that they are
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as grant funded
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
um and so they know that they are only
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
funded to the extent that the grant will
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
continue and that they have that
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's a both and in the sense that if
 
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
uh it's a both and in the sense that if
they

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
remain in state employees you might have
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
to correct me on this a little bit but
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
if they remain a state
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
employee for longer than a year they are
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
part of the collective bargaining unit
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
and therefore if the grant funds run out
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
i can't pay you for that position
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
but you now are a state employee that is
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know the bumping rights and
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything else in terms of where else
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
you might fit so it's kind of a boat
 
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.870 align:start position:0%
you might fit so it's kind of a boat
answer

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much once my grand
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
funds are out i'm done
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you had a
 
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you had a
question

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think um
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray was before me
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
though so why don't we let um uh
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative murray go first and then
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'll go
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative murray i'm sorry no
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
problem i thought mary was first but i'm
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
happy to go thank you both
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
um can you speak uh more broadly around
 
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
um can you speak uh more broadly around
the

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
charter school grants beyond the
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
employee positions
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
what happens to the charter schools when
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
the grants go away
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
when the grant goes away does that
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
impact a will that create
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
a financial burden on um on this on the
 
01:04:00.559 --> 01:04:01.430 align:start position:0%
a financial burden on um on this on the
state

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
right so this grant is what's referred
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
to as an innovation and startup grant
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so the only eligible expenses are for
 
01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.069 align:start position:0%
so the only eligible expenses are for
startup

01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
startup
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the charter school not for the
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
operations of the charter school
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
so from day one when a student is
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the charter school
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
out of your education trust fund we will
 
01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
out of your education trust fund we will
pay

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
state adequacy for those students so
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is designed
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
around the startup um i can tell you
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
that if you go to the department's
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
website there is a quite extensive
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh white paper on the long-term
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
financial implications of this and it
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
does not create a long-term burden
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
chair my question is with regard to
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the adequacy funding for
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
charter schools and have you taken
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
into account and built in those number
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
projections into the amount
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
of uh dollars that you are asking for in
 
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
of uh dollars that you are asking for in
those

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
lines do you feel that you've adequately
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
covered it
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
we believe we have we tried to do
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
estimates in terms of what we think the
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
students will be in all of the different
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
categories so we do think that we've
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
adequately covered it
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and in terms of um charter school
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
estimate numbers for new charity schools
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
what do you anticipate in the next two
 
01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
what do you anticipate in the next two
years

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't have that number off the top
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
my head but i can get that information
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
and get it back to you
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on this
 
01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.789 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on this
slide

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
so i would like to then just turn
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
quickly and again i don't want to
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh overstay my welcome uh commissioner
 
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.230 align:start position:0%
uh overstay my welcome uh commissioner
you

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh as long as we're keeping you here
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay well so then uh so timmy can you
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
put up the
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
federal covet response funds yeah so
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is something i just wanted to put
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
this is something i just wanted to put
on

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
on your radar because there's a lot of
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions around this
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
um and these are the federal covet
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
response funds that we have received
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
this year so far
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
and well it's actually kind of a little
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
bit of last year and this year that i
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to kind of
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
lay out for you so you get to see what
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
that looks like so so far this year
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
um for k12 we received about 305 million
 
01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:29.910 align:start position:0%
um for k12 we received about 305 million
dollars

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
of additional funds um i will tell you
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
that there is another
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh relief two other relief packages that
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
are being negotiated
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um one is the the current in the current
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
administration there's another
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
k-12 relief package that would provide
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
more funds
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
to the schools as well we don't have
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
that yet but i just put that out there
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not included in here
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the first launch that we received was
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
sr1 was 37 million dollars
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
most of this money um is what's referred
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
to as pass-through money
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
so we receive it and then we pass
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
through our grant management system to
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
the schools to be able to deploy
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's eligible for a lot of different um
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know activities as we've described
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
so those sr1 grants were made available
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
to the schools last may
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
um so far this year we've used about six
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
of those of those funds so the schools
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
are continuing to work through those
 
01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
are continuing to work through those
funds

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and then if you just roll up a little
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
bit tammy
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
the next crunch that we received was sr2
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
sr2 received about 156 million dollars
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
and this was able to be used
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
almost identically as esser won in terms
 
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
almost identically as esser won in terms
of

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know helping the schools to
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
basically respond
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
to the coven um they did add a couple of
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
things they
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
emphasized in the grants award
 
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
emphasized in the grants award
notification

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh an emphasis on student learning loss
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
school facility repairs
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
that would help relative to viral
 
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.190 align:start position:0%
that would help relative to viral
transmission

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
including you know air quality systems
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that in the schools that
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
schools are this is an eligible use for
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's a catch-all at the end
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
of this in terms of eligibility just
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:11.670 align:start position:0%
of this in terms of eligibility just
says

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
other activities that are necessary to
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
maintain the operation so
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
a fairly broad uh you know category of
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
expenses but
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
um those funds we've allocated out to
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
the districts at this point
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary allocations we've not yet
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
set those up in the grant management
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
systems we're continuing to work on that
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
we needed to do some programming around
 
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.349 align:start position:0%
we needed to do some programming around
that

01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
um but i will tell you that again we've
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
only used uh six of the 37 that has been
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
allocated so
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh we don't think that there's schools
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are out of funds at this point in
 
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
that are out of funds at this point in
time

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
um you know that are there somehow
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
they're unable to access funding that
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
they need on a more urgent basis
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
um the other category is we've got the
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency education relief
 
01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency education relief
fund

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me commissioner i'm
 
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:56.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me commissioner i'm
sorry

01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
37 million you said that only
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
six of that has been used uh so far
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
they've only drawn down drawn down six
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
million out there
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
and how did the schools apply for that
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
or did you
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
send it out yep so the way that it works
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
is so we did allocations to the schools
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and then we in our grant management
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
system we set up a
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
budgeting template all of the schools at
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
have completed a budget for
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
their the use of their funds um and then
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to work through that and then
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
what happens is they spend money on an
 
01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:39.749 align:start position:0%
what happens is they spend money on an
activity

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
they report that activity as complete we
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
validate that it's eligible
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then they are funded uh they're back
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
funded through an ach transaction
 
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.829 align:start position:0%
funded through an ach transaction
through

01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
so the school spends the money first and
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
then they get reimbursed
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
correct these are all reimbursement
 
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.070 align:start position:0%
correct these are all reimbursement
grants

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay and what you'll find is that
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the department of education
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
almost everything we do is a
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement grant
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
which mary's shaking your head that's a
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
good thing sorry yeah
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
do you do you have a list
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh for what the schools were
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
um authorized and which ones have
 
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
um authorized and which ones have
knocked

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
knocked
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
or which one
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
which ones are not spending the money
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
because i i hear
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
doing enough and i just want to try to
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
solve whatever that is okay i mean i can
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
the information here's the grant
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
allocation by school and here's the
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
amount that they've drawn down
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
but bear in mind that all of the schools
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
have budgeted their funds
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it may be if they haven't drawn it
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
down that they have some plans for it in
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
june or something like that right
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
i do know for example um you know
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath is here in
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
manchester i had a conversation
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
they purchased a lot of technology and
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
they were waiting for the technology
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
order to come in
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and so until that came in like it
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be kind of a step and i don't know
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative keith if you know if that
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
came in yet or not but for a long period
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
of time they hadn't thrown anything down
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we were waiting for this bill from
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
the tech company
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know commissioner but um i will
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
check on that because that was a concern
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
of mine as well thank you
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah but i mean they've all planned to
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
do something with it like nobody's
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
not budgeted it towards something
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
i would yeah i would still like to get
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh representative
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
murray you have a question yeah thank
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh following along that when you're
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
providing that information would it also
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
be possible to provide
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
examples of what some of these programs
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
or projects are that the schools are
 
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
or projects are that the schools are
doing

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure although in this vernacular i mean
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
these are the types of things that
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're eligible
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
is that helpful uh yes um i mean
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
i can read that i'm just curious uh more
 
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
i can read that i'm just curious uh more
specifically

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
within this broader paradigm of what's
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
available what schools are actually
 
01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:08.229 align:start position:0%
available what schools are actually
doing

01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
so i would tell you and i'm happy to
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
give you any grant that you want
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
but if you look at this list this pretty
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
much enumerates it
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
what you're going to find is there's
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of invoices for masks
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
and cleaning supplies
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to find uh you know
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
purchases of technology
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know in manchester they made a
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
significant investment in technology and
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think you'll see that
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
in many of the other districts uh that
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
they've got you're gonna see
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh procurement of hot spots you're gonna
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
see procurements
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
of like there's going to be training
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
that they did for their
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
schools you're going to see extra
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
janitorial work that was done you'll see
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
extra bus
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
runs uh to minimize and make sure that
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
we had social distancing
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
so it really is kind of this is what's
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
eligible and this is the thing that you
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
so and when we get to the second trunks
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
the new things that i think we'll see
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
is we're going to see more emphasis on
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
learning loss more emphasis on air
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
systems then i'm not sure what'll end up
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
in that other category but we'll
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
wait and see so well the
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
um well the grant amount and escrow 2
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow the same um
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
process allocation as the uh
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
s root one it will and we've already
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
given preliminary allocations and then
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're just finalizing those
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and part of the reason why it takes a
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of time is we have some
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
programming that we have to do and
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
um and as you know there's been some
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting pre-reduced
 
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.470 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting pre-reduced
information

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
this is a grant that allocates based on
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
title one formulas and so we're just
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that we get the best
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
information possible to do the
 
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
information possible to do the
allocation

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much either i don't see
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
anything else right now
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
roll up a little bit yeah excuse me our
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
does have a question thank you madam
 
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
does have a question thank you madam
chair

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
speaking of freedom-reduced lunch
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
in your budget um did you
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the amounts i believe that
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
um but have you encouraged
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative body to really look at
 
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
the legislative body to really look at
[Music]

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
allowing your department to use
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
2020 data
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
versus the 21 data that will show
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
those serious reductions that i think we
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple of pieces of legislation
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
um i know that 263 does it
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and 263 does a couple of things it it
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
keeps um that difference and
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
also this disparity but um do you have
 
01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:52.470 align:start position:0%
also this disparity but um do you have
an

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
input on that please sure i do so i will
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
tell you the number one thing that i am
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to do
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
is to go out and get these families
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
signed up um
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason that i'm doing that is we
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
have until june to be able to get those
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
families signed up
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
so our initial census was low but as we
 
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
so our initial census was low but as we
continue

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
to bring students back into school we've
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
now got a
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know a governor's directive that
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
kids are in school at least two days a
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
week which means that those kids are
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
gonna be showing up we're gonna be
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
touching them
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
we have until june to get that so what i
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
will tell you in the governor's budget
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is funding for free and reduced
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid that has been built
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
into there already
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know i know that there's a number of
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals out there but that
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
has already been built into that
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
but the number one thing we can do is
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
try to get
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know the families to sign up
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
because it's not if even if you as a
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
state legislature can solve it at the
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
it could potentially affect some of my
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
federal reporting as well
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
the federal mayor may not have the same
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
degree of latitude in terms of how they
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
want to understand that
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
so our best solution is to make sure
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
between now
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
and june 30th we sign up all the
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
families that we can get signed up
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
and could i just to follow up then thank
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
you commissioner i did not know i
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be that one time
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
october won't count
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
you have that the the federal doe has
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
given you that flexibility
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i've always had that flexibility um
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and but we just are continuing to
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
emphasize it it's just we've never run
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
into a circumstance where
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the october count was so short and we're
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
like oh no now what are we gonna do
 
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:23.830 align:start position:0%
like oh no now what are we gonna do
right

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
but we still have the ability we've
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually created a
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
specific kind of male flyer piece for
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of explains like hey it's not
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
just free
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
lunch there's all these other programs
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
that are tied to this to encourage them
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
and so again particularly with students
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
coming back into the buildings i think
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a good probability of
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
you know getting identifying those
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
families and getting them signed up
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay commissioner you you have more
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
in what sense i guess not right um okay
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
so governors
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
so the gear funds or governor's
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
emergency education funds again this is
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh funding that the governor has that's
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
discretionary that
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
goes into the education but it is more
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
broadly available for broad response to
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh the coronavirus
 
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.229 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh the coronavirus
effect

01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
um two of the areas for example where
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
this has been directed so far
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
has been for compensatory education for
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
our kids who
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
have special needs so idea students
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and probably we'll end up with a
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more of that
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
as well as focusing on student mental
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
and behavioral health
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then the other one that i want to
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
point out to you is the ian's
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
7 million so that is emergency age and
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
when the 37 million dollars were
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
provided to us it required what's
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
referred to as equitable services
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
and that means that the local school
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
districts provide
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
support to the non-public schools in
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
their district
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
for students who need that support these
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
are title 1 students who need that
 
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.270 align:start position:0%
are title 1 students who need that
support

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so what they did in the second
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
tranche in 156 million dollar grant
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
they said the local school districts no
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
longer have to provide
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
equitable services but the state has to
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
provide equitable services
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the non-public schools and they
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
provided us seven million dollars to do
 
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.229 align:start position:0%
provided us seven million dollars to do
that

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
the thing that's really odd here is when
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
you do equitable services
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
i don't get to provide this as a grant
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the most part i don't provide this
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
as a grant
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the non-public school i have to
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually procure the services
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the non-public school so that if the
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
school needs chromebooks
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
i have to go buy chromebooks for them i
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
can't give them money to go buy
 
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
can't give them money to go buy
chromebooks

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
chromebooks
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so just to let i only share that
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
with you because
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
that is a um administratively that's
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
something we're having to walk through
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
because we're not necessarily set up to
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
go procure seven million dollars worth
 
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
go procure seven million dollars worth
of

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh services for all of our non-public
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
schools in the state but it is something
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
we're working with department of
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
administrative services and
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh and hopefully we'll be able to
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
execute that well
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then if you want to just scroll up
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
one more time tammy excuse me uh i think
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't have enough challenges with
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh what was going on so uh the feds
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
thought you could
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh handle something new but
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%

also looking for that as well so i'll
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%

so i'll make sure i send that out
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
so the next question the us department
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
of agriculture provided us with an
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
additional 47 million dollars to support
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
our food nutrition
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the state um as you know we're
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
serving many more meals
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state because we've
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
opened up our eligibility and this just
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
helps us continue to support that
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
and then lastly through gopher uh which
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
is the governor's office for emergency
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
relief and recovery
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh we provided november supplemental
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
grants to the schools for 45 million
 
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
grants to the schools for 45 million
dollars

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
that included a every school got 200 per
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
student for 35 million
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then we had a 10 million dollar pot
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
where we had schools that had
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary you know disruption they
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
had some project that had to get done
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
and they had no other funding sources
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
and they applied for those grant funds
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
and then we fully awarded those as well
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
so these this is just a summary so far
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
that have come into the school if you go
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
back up to the top so the total of all
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
these is about 305 million dollars
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we have made available to the
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.709 align:start position:0%
 
cobit

01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
cobit
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
this was all basically from
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
the cares act that was passed a year ago
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
this money combination of the cares
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
actually was passed a year ago
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
as well as um from the
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh the relief the caris chrisa that was
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
passed in december 28
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
is 156 million come to us from that and
 
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.229 align:start position:0%
is 156 million come to us from that and
then

01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
48 million dollars was just an
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the u.s department of
 
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the u.s department of
education

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting any additional money
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
then from the uh december
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
so this is the money that from that bill
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that is directed to the
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
school system you know i don't know what
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
the funds are that will be directed to
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
the state and how that will be
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
distributed within the state so i can't
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
we do anticipate if the current
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
relief legislation is passed that's in
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
congress now
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
that additional funds will be made
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh i would like to say that i
 
01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
okay uh i would like to say that i
contacted

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
contacted
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of schools here in
 
01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of schools here in
conway

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
conway
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
and they have tried
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
every which way they could
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
to get the parents to sign the children
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
up for uh the free and reduced lunch
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and they are having like zero
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
success in doing that and so
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know kevin said i send text messages
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
i do phone calls i send
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
emails i send the forms home
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
with the kids and we're just not
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
we're just not making any progress in
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and you know i don't know
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
what other school systems are doing but
 
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:21.189 align:start position:0%
what other school systems are doing but
i

01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
i certainly believe in our sau
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
that they have tried everything possible
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
to get the families to to sign up
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i i know that you know
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
everyone right now is eligible for
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
lunch and so it becomes a
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh a really tough situation
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
to change the um to get
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
to get the families to sign up so i have
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
if you have some sort of a brilliant
 
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.709 align:start position:0%
if you have some sort of a brilliant
idea

01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
about what what the
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
superintendents can do uh would you let
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
us know
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
because they have in at least in sau9
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
from uh what he explained to me i don't
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
know what else he could do
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's the only other strategy that i have
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
continued to hear is um
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know going to where the meals are
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
being distributed because we still
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
do have some meals that are being
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
distributed to families doing pickups at
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
centralized locations
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
so when those parents come to pick up
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the meal have them fill out the form for
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay good and then i have districts that
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
are going door to door
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i have i do have one lea that has
 
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
um i have i do have one lea that has
gotten

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
all of them in right and but they
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
literally had to
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
go to the families and say we need you
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
to fill this out and then they were able
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
to get them
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
but i i will reiterate that in the
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
current budget proposal we do have the
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
free reduced differentiated aid
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
you know so as this thing evolves we'll
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay are there uh are there any further
 
01:25:05.679 --> 01:25:06.550 align:start position:0%
okay are there uh are there any further
questions

01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative heath thank you
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i just want to concur with
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
with our chair
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very very difficult time for
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
school districts and families
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
and any help that the department of ed
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
can provide
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just i don't even know where to
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
begin with all the issues that have
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
come up and my biggest worry are those
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
children who have simply
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
disappeared and nobody can reach them
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
nobody can find them
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a hard time and it
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly is a situation that we've had
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
discussions in our children's caucus
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
about thank you commissioner
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
but i do have a couple of other
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions i i didn't know
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair are you wrapping up uh
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
no if you have other questions please
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i i will excuse me just a second i
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
mickey do i have education scheduled for
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
thursday of next week
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's the day so um
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
we will have uh uh a deeper dive
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
into uh into what's going on there
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
so i as so we'll
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have some other things but please
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
if you know if you have questions
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to uh please ask them at
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i just have two
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
quick ones um one question and i think i
 
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
saw it in the budget
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i was very excited about seeing it
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping i'm correct in my
 
01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping i'm correct in my
assumption

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
is the national teacher accreditation
 
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.430 align:start position:0%
is the national teacher accreditation
program

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i thought i saw five thousand
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
dollars in each year of the biennium for
 
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
dollars in each year of the biennium for
that

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
am i correct um so i believe i believe
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's a membership
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay um and my second question
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
is with regard to teacher credentialing
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is how
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
much funding do you have in reserve
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
in that um well not in the budget itself
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
but in the department how much money do
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
you have in reserve
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the exact amount but i
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
do know that what we did is we just
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
this last year we reduced our uh renewal
 
01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
this last year we reduced our uh renewal
fees

01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
so uh essentially because i saw there
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
was some reserve that was developing
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
and so we're just going to return that
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
back out to our credential holders by a
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
reduced fee is what we're doing
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
because i know you're self-funded
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
through that that program
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
that that department um but if you could
 
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.229 align:start position:0%
that that department um but if you could
that's

01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
really that i think it's important like
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
so the philosophy we have is like we
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
should not be accumulating money there
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
right the fees are supposed to pay for
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
the credentials and if we don't need
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that money then we should return it to
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the credentials
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why we reduce that just one
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
thought though um with
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
that those funds one of the areas that
 
01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
that those funds one of the areas that
um

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
is often lacking is professional
 
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.350 align:start position:0%
is often lacking is professional
development

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
statewide for our teachers and i often
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
thought that that would be
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
a wonderful source of funding for
 
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:02.709 align:start position:0%
a wonderful source of funding for
teachers

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
and educate elite educational leaders
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the state could do i
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean this goes back to my
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
former role that the department never
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
having enough money to do professional
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
development just a thought i thank you
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
for answering my questions
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner is that a 125
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
situation which one
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
the credentialing when you say 125 i'm
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
what you mean oh well it's uh
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
where you charge 125 percent of the cost
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know how they derive that
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
fee so we've had a fee for some amount
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
of time and then i saw a balance
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
accumulating so we did some modeling and
 
01:28:44.639 --> 01:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
accumulating so we did some modeling and
said

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
we can reduce the fee i didn't want to
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
go too drastic and then i ended up in
 
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:48.790 align:start position:0%
go too drastic and then i ended up in
trouble

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
but we reduced the fee and are leading
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
it back off so i don't think it is
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
based on a fixed percent of cost plus a
 
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:56.470 align:start position:0%
based on a fixed percent of cost plus a
percent

01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
plus a fee because the number of
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
licenses that we renew varies every year
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
so it's really a function of just
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
managing that
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
balance in the educator fund uh what i i
 
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.229 align:start position:0%
balance in the educator fund uh what i i
mean

01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think representative heath might
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
remember maybe represent
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
remember you do as well i think a couple
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
of years ago you guys might have come in
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
and swept some of that
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
and um i think that that's the teacher's
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
money and i think we're gonna get it
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
back for the teachers
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
so uh tammy you had a uh your hand
 
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
so uh tammy you had a uh your hand
raised

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that it is not a
 
01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that it is not a
125.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
125.
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you thank you
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn yes i wonder
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner if i could go back to the
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative umberger with regard to
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh difficulty in having
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
parents sign up for the free and reduced
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that i'm
 
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.669 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that i'm
understanding

01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
that is the if parents don't sign up
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced lunch program
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the kids don't get
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
or is it just or do they get it anyway
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it's just sort of a paperwork issue
 
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is what the problem is so
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
we've received waivers so normally what
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
we have to do is we have to qualify
 
01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
we have to do is we have to qualify
people

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to receive free lunch we've
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
gotten waivers
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic from the u.s
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture that allows us
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
to feed everybody
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
right so whether you fill out a form or
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
you're not it's free food right
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
and so what's happening there's no
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
motivation to fill out the paperwork
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
because you're going to get your food
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
whether you fill out the paperwork or
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
you don't fill out the paperwork
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
so many people are like well there's no
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
reason to fill it out i still get free
 
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
reason to fill it out i still get free
lunch

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's what's driven it the
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
difficulty is
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
is that well while you're focusing
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
really on the state
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
solution relative to that in terms of
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
state adequacy and the effect on state
 
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
state adequacy and the effect on state
funding

01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
that free and reduced application is
 
01:30:47.199 --> 01:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
that free and reduced application is
also

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
the basis for many of my federal
 
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
the basis for many of my federal
allocations

01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
allocations
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
and so if those parents don't fill them
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
out you might solve the state problem
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
but i still may have a federal problem
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that's why i say my number one goal
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
is like let's get the applications
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
filled out as best you can
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a follow-up on that
 
01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.790 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a follow-up on that
certainly

01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so my other question is is this
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
i wonder if part of the problem here or
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
part of the issue here
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
is um some reluctance on the part of
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
parents to to kind of acknowledge
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
that they you know that they are in need
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the of the free and reduced lunch
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
program and
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is is you know as
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
sort of as a practical matter if i'm a
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
student in one of these schools and i'm
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
getting free and reduced lunch
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
does does everybody in the school know
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
that i mean do the other kids know that
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether they're supposed to know it or
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
not i'm really sort of asking a
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
practical question do
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
do they in fact know it so there are um
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to make sure that
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
that information from the system is not
 
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.550 align:start position:0%
that information from the system is not
shared

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible that a student might
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
do that but a student walking through
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
the lunch line nobody's gonna know
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner maybe somebody
 
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.310 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner maybe somebody
could

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
um forward to us the
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh title programs that are
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
allocated based on free and reduced
 
01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.430 align:start position:0%
allocated based on free and reduced
lunch

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would help
 
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.709 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would help
representative

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
lynn understand how
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
counts are and uh so
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do i can send this
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
over to you and this might be helpful
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
this is i mentioned the flyer so i just
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
like called this up
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
i can shrink it down a bit so you can
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
see it better
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
but this is more than a meal application
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then we go through all of
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's a pebt eligibility after
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
school academic enrichment programs
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meal 30 day rollover
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the next year state and federal
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
funding and school budgets funds
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
computer technology in your home
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
fee waivers for college application
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
resources for classroom teachers like
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
all of these things are affected if we
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't get these applications so this is
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
a flyer that we created and shared with
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
the schools and i'm happy to share with
 
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
the schools and i'm happy to share with
you

01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
help understand why it's important and
 
01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
help understand why it's important and
why

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
we need to get this you know these
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
applications done
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be great
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much but you don't
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
have the actual
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
title programs identified there do you
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
no i don't i can go get the title
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
program for you as well yeah just
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know just hand write it on there you
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't uh
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know we don't need you to prepare
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
something different just
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
so that we know that uh you know
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
what what what programs are the only
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
question i'll tell you is that you know
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
as we're having a conversation at the
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
the feds are having conversation as well
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
about the effect of this because it's
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
not unique to new hampshire
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so while i can describe those we may
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
or may not get some kind of relief at
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
right we don't know if they provide some
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a waiver they say use last
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
year's counts or
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know and there have been
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they've given us
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility in terms of the accounts
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
it makes it very difficult for um
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
for the for those for the dollars that
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
come in for the federal program
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
for the schools to budget and to you
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
know to know but
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
obviously they will never turn down
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
money that's sent in the future so
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully we can get all of
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of the
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative heath i apologize madam

your opportunity so please we haven't
 
01:34:54.159 --> 01:34:54.709 align:start position:0%
your opportunity so please we haven't
talked

talked
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
much at commissioner thank you for
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked much about the
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
when we i don't want you to do it now
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
but when we meet again
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
would you please just review
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
the steps and the differences and
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now with all of us
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
different scholarships
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
how they're working to whom they'll go
 
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.390 align:start position:0%
how they're working to whom they'll go
who

01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
gets what and who doesn't get what they
 
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:25.830 align:start position:0%
gets what and who doesn't get what they
use

01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
are used to getting i would deeply
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because i've been trying
 
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because i've been trying
to

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
look at the draft of hb2 and looking at
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
i just can't decipher all of that and it
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you could walk me through that next
 
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
week so i'm happy to do that
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
expect i want to be careful so the
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
office of strategic planning is the one
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
who's administered most of the governor
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
or through the university system
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
directly so
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
it might be more appropriate for them to
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
explain those scholarship programs
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
because those are not administered for
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%

i don't believe i need to be a capital
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
budget so we could do
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
school aid like adequacy and building
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%

that time
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
and then the commissioner and tammy can
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
do the capital budget presentation
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%

i can't even think about tomorrow and uh
yeah

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%

01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
so it really depends on
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of questions you know you have
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
with the with the various agencies
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we're looking also on monday
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're calling that hb1
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 work session
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh so mickey will be going through
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
all of the areas that affect us
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and hopefully we'll
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have the the bill
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh before then
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
but uh if not we'll still go through it
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
and make up our own hb2 as to
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
what what we would what we would really
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
like to see in hb2 as opposed to
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
what might be there so is that
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
work for you uh mickey it does and um
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%

01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
to schedule all of these work sessions
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat generically titled so we
 
01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat generically titled so we
could

01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
um fill some space with you know for
 
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.070 align:start position:0%
