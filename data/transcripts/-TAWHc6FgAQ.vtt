to uh get those things moving forward
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
somehow in terms of of a recommendation
 
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.140 align:start position:0%
I do have a uh
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
a suggestion that came forth from
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
initially this suggestion came forth
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh when we are just discussing it prior
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
to making the interim study motion it
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
came for us from uh the New Hampshire
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
school boards Association to establish a
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
commission study to more thoroughly
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
investigate and look at Cooperative
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
school districts since then I've
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
received uh last night
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
from the Department a they've looked at
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
that recommendation that came in from
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association and
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
identified perhaps those people that
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
should be on a commission study and and
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
looked at the duties and
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the commission and
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
added to it based upon our discussion at
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
the previous meeting
 
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
trying to help us out and and derive
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a direction here so I'm
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to pass that out to you right now
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll see what came in from doe last
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
night I got this from this like must
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
have been about 5 30 in the afternoon I
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
opened it up at midnight last night and
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
and saw it and whoa whoa and so I'm
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
gonna pass it around this way and that
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
there's ample copies here for the public
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
a few more you need a few more that way
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
you'll take those
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll save a couple here for those
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
who might come in
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
you got enough right there
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
going all the way around take one okay
 
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.389 align:start position:0%
going all the way around take one okay
sure

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
just a few remarks about The Cooperative
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
in our discussion last week we had folks
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
presenting to us or testifying or
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
offering us support
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
and it appeared to me that we have the
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
majority of Cooperative school districts
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
according to what we heard maybe
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
two-thirds are okay with it the way it
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
is one-third of the ones that have these
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
issues or or among one District within
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
may have those issues uh as far as how
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
do I get out of this how do we resolve
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
how to get out of it Etc
 
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.220 align:start position:0%
and and so um
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
with that we came up with the
 
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
with that we came up with the
um

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
idea that this we don't have all the
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
answers for this then last night being a
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
old school principal Minister it came
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
out of Maine we had the same issues over
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
there with sad school administrative
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
districts School unions which readfield
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
is in a school Union which is different
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
than the sad and then you have the
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
singular districts like the city of
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
Portland and some smaller there's a lot
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
of different makeups over there too and
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
when they went and tried to consolidate
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
and do that that you know didn't
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
consolidate a lot of districts one that
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
I know of was Rumford Mexico but they
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
are right beside each other and the
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
other side of the androscogen river and
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
they did tie together seeing they were
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to do that probably anyways
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
when we look at what happened in Vermont
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
where if they didn't have a k through 12
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
District they were all the little k6s
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
and k3s and k-8s we're told you will try
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
to tie in with a full K through 12. well
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
that that has been done but they're
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're but done through tuitioning
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
programs like where my grandkids are
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
going to school and Barnett now the
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
tuition to either Lyndon or Saint Jay
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
Academy so they have a tuition from
 
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
Vermont's had a tuition program way
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
before we had a tuition program
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
so in looking at where we go if we if we
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
say we're going to
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
destroy the Cooperative school districts
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
and start over from scratch we are
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
headed down the road to a tremendous
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
problem and an Untold consequences and I
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
just think that that's that's going to
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
be a very difficult process to maneuver
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
through although some may think that's
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
the way to go with through due to
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
frustration if we haven't been able to
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
resolve this in the last umpteen years
 
00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:49.730 align:start position:0%
resolve this in the last umpteen years
um

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
now so let's take a look at what we've
 
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.180 align:start position:0%
got here in front of us in terms of the
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation or the thoughts which we
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
had the preceding meeting we were
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
looking at a thorough well done
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
commission study not that the one done
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
in 2017 wasn't that
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
but we have been told that it didn't go
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
far enough in a lot of respects and
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
there are still still some districts
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
that didn't even have articles of
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
agreement two of them
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
one thing we got to note in a commission
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
study and I was reminded of this by uh
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
our Jennifer fore HB 1629 was a bill
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that passed the legislature this last
 
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
that passed the legislature this last
session

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
it stipulates that any future
 
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.870 align:start position:0%
it stipulates that any future
uh

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
commissions committee commissions or
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
other types of working groups which
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
involve both non-elected officials and
 
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:54.620 align:start position:0%
elected officials must have a majority
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
of elected officials on that Commission
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
and the commission can be no larger than
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
15 members
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the way that this
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
commission was recommended years ago
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
that bear Christina kindly offered to US
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
during the testimony and all that the
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
makeup of non-uh elected officials Way
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
Beyond the you know the the limit which
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
would be if you had 15 only seven people
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
could come from uh not only eight would
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
have to come from elected officials we
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
know I know from my experience it's
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
tough to get on any kind of study
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
eight elected legislators there's a lot
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
of reasons why they can't attend or it's
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
just very difficult many of you are
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
sitting on various groups right now and
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
you see that happening like the CTE
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
Council that would that's another one
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
which would be revamped with this
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
particular policy that went through and
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
now it's state law
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at that we can
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
have technical support
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
on any of these commissions
 
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
so you would list the
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
active members the voting members and
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
there'd have to be a majority of elected
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
officials on that Senate in the house
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
we we can develop a commission that has
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
technical support you can even list
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
those technical support people in a
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
commission report as part of the
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission but the non-voting members
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
everybody get where I'm coming from on
 
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.470 align:start position:0%
everybody get where I'm coming from on
this

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that came out uh of uh
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.889 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that came out uh of uh
president

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:38.899 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration and all that
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh and it was a bipartisan bill
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
and I didn't catch it
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that we lost
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee one year
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't catch it and we had to go and
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
reinstate it this last year we did that
 
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.850 align:start position:0%
reinstate it this last year we did that
so

00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
in looking at the makeup of the
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
commission study here if that's the
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
route we're going and this is what I'd
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
like to do is look at this first first
 
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
of all I'd like to find out from the
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
committee are we all on the same page as
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
far as if we're going to make a
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation up or down
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
that on these bills now we know that
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
anybody can this elected can introduce
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
any one of these bills again that we
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
can't stop that from happening
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
but from the education committee's
 
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.690 align:start position:0%
but from the education committee's
perspective

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
um do we feel comfortable in in going
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
forward with any one of those bills or
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
are we on the same page as far as we
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
need to have a better understanding of
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
all the results and the actions might
 
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:45.299 align:start position:0%
occur as a result of our taking action
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
too so Rick a question for you on that
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
do you have um
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
if if there were to be a
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh well we have to do interim study
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
reports for each of the
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's correct each of the bills like
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
you said what um what do you
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
um what are you thinking the reports
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
would look like if um if the committee
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
was to move forward with a
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation for a uh commission to
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
study this if you're going to have a
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
commission study then you would look on
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
this and see what all the duties and
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that committee would be
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
no but I'm talking about it on the on
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the on the two sentence report yeah on
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
the two sentence report I would I would
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
suggest that we we say that for this
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill which is maybe dealing
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
with disillusion which is a component of
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
the larger study we want to look at I
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
would I would indicate that we cannot
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
support this bill moving forward as we
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
recommend that uh a a commission study
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
be done to look at these particular
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
issues and and you know you don't have
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
to go into depth as this would but
 
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:55.220 align:start position:0%
because a dissolution uh
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
bonding all the stuff associated with
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
debt of buildings articles agreement you
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
don't have to list all that but you can
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
list the broad topics in that last
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
sentence so you I think we can do it in
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
just a two two sentence type report
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
but suggest that and and then have
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
available as a recommendation we can
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
have this as a sort of like an addendum
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
to our recommendation as a committee
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is what we would recommend it's
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
available to anybody who wants to move
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
forward so maybe maybe something a
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
commission to review and propose changes
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
to RSA 195.
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean just keep it at a yeah 30
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
000 foot level yeah that's fine with me
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
I I the wording that uh you know the
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
study report does what I would like to
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
also say though that we did look at this
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and that we do have a
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation regarding the commission
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
membership and duties responsibilities
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
associated with that commission or
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
something such as that so that this is
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
available if that's what we want to do
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that when we're doing
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
that on the 24th because that's where we
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
make the final decision right right
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
but the issue right now are we in favor
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
of all of us the idea that we would do
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
the commission angle rather than
 
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.130 align:start position:0%
the commission angle rather than
um

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:18.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
well the all of them would be down then
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
and then we would have this same kind of
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation for all three of them
 
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.650 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation for all three of them
right

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I agree that we need a commission
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I it seems like all we're focusing on
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
is dissolution and you said you know
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
there are that's just one topic let's
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at them that you know as I said
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
before the co-ops were developed by
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
incentives from the Department of
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
Education and I for one feel that uh
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
there should be at least some discussion
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
about how we can support co-ops in order
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
to keep them going because uh with the
 
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
economy of scale once these people break
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
up you know just like lemster and Goshen
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
I mean it's minus it it just costs them
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh just to run the
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
schools because it's so small so I think
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
that you know there needs to be two
 
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:18.860 align:start position:0%
sides to this coin not only dissolution
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
but also what can be done to help the
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
ones that that want to maintain or even
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
the ones that want to dissolve and
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
realize that they can't what can the
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
state do to offer them some incentives
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
to keep up their their Cooperative
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
districts so if you look at this this
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
report that I got from Dio this is doe
 
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:43.100 align:start position:0%
and and the school boards Association
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
the doe and um Diana's here today uh
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
this came in from Liz
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
is this something that um
 
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.620 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion over at doe
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
in regard to what we should do as a
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here on this anybody from
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to it yes good
 
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.190 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to it yes good
morning

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so I received that above my request
 
00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:17.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the button yeah yeah
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
now it's on
 
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:27.529 align:start position:0%
now it's on
um

00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
I had requested that from Barrett
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
Christina understanding that he had
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
submitted it to you I guess a year ago
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we reviewed it commissioner and I
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
reviewed it
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
um we made some revisions to it if you
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
can I can provide you a black line
 
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
between what Barrett had submitted a
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
year ago and how we revised it
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I think we revised the composition
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
but also parsed out some of the items
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
that we would think would be subject to
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
review and discussion by that Commission
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Liz
 
00:23:02.649 --> 00:23:02.659 align:start position:0%
um and that's in Roman 2 on this report
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
which we have here for a and I did take
 
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
which we have here for a and I did take
the

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity last night to add in one
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
more to that okay but um
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to if we could walk through
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
these item item item because we have a
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
little time here and see if this answers
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
some of the things represent Tanner that
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
you were just raising
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh it shouldn't be just how to get
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
out you know it's it's obviously when
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking many other aspects of
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
Education like in building a we look at
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
consolidation as a a key component of
 
00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:42.419 align:start position:0%
receiving and rating applications in
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
other words you know you're not
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
splintering and going to cost more
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
dollars you're trying to do a savings of
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
dollars in terms of administration of
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
functioning as a school with
 
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
functioning as a school with
consolidation

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
consolidation
 
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.690 align:start position:0%
consolidation
so

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
um that's what I'd like to do is take
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
right 2A right now Roman 2A look at that
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then is that something that we would
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
recommend as a Duty or responsibility of
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
yes representing cardelli yes um I I
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
think that's a key area to look at
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that a lot of the frustration
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
over the years has been in that area
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
um many if not most of the bills we've
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
received over the time that I've been
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
here which is a considerable number have
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
been related to the withdrawal process
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
and it's uh almost impossible for a
 
00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.020 align:start position:0%
smaller District
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
to withdraw from a Cooperative
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
given the majority vote of the entire
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative so that's a key area I think
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would just offer
 
00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
that we put something in there about
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
sustainability and support for co-ops
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
that that it be explored
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm hearing what you're saying but
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's say what we think we should
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
go in here as an addition after we go
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
through all these elements
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
sustainability of a co-op and the
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
importance of a co-op may already be in
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
here it's one of those statements I
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
haven't read through it that thoroughly
 
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.890 align:start position:0%
haven't read through it that thoroughly
so

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
um but keep that you know write that
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
down right now sustainability of co-ops
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
in the interest of of Education
 
00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:30.950 align:start position:0%
in the interest of of Education
um

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
so yeah one third of the districts
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's usually what part of the issue is
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know how do I get out
 
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.450 align:start position:0%
you know how do I get out
um

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
children in our district aren't getting
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
what they deserve it's costing us more
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
money Etc or whatever the issue is it's
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
usually about how do I withdraw from the
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
co-op so obviously that should be a
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
process that's looked at uh B the powers
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
and review authority of the State Board
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
of Education in the withdrawal process
 
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:04.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
b r c the educational impact of
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a Cooperative School
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
District on the educational
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the students impacted
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
by withdrawal or dissolution of
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts yes
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
I can see this happening especially the
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
high school level where
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
Town moves but there and has a different
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
high school going to but the students
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
are in the bigger high school with the
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
co-op with subjects that aren't being
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
supplied and the new thing they're going
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the agreements could be that
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
they stay until they graduate I mean
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
we've done that in an area agreement
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
type thing so that's one of the things
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
on the educational impact where they're
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
going in other subjects going to follow
 
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.529 align:start position:0%
going in other subjects going to follow
them

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:56.539 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
yeah that's all related yeah
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
any discussion on C further going down
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
to D educational options for students
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
who are impacted by the withdrawal of
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
dissolution of Co-op school districts
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like you were what you
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
were looking at oh yeah D the options
 
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know do it oh yeah
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
do I stay or do I go somewhere else and
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
then in are there any places else to go
 
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.409 align:start position:0%
then in are there any places else to go
to

00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
um that has to be approved by a
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
receiving School
 
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.250 align:start position:0%
receiving School
um

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%

that's a huge issue right there
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
you know how do we divvy up debt how do
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%

are you willing to leave without having
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
other tangible property are divided
 
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
between the copper District any
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
withdrawing district and or the
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing districts
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
I representation on a Cooperative School
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
District board and how board members are
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
elected board representation allocated
 
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:18.260 align:start position:0%
between pre-existing districts Etc
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
that was an issue that I think came from
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa Litchfield here who had a
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
district that wanted representation
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
J surveys and public opinions of parents
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
students and community members of
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
pre-existing school districts and a
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
consideration of the issues and
 
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:41.539 align:start position:0%
considerations that drive those opinions
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to educational
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities availability of
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and extracurricular
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
activities in Cooperative districts tax
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
rates disparity of costs per pupil and
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
equalize valuation of real estate among
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
other issues that's a lot in that one
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
right there deals with uh so much
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at all of it needs to
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
K on the other page identify key
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
required elements in Cooperative School
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement and require all
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts to have
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
approved articles of agreement I stocked
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
that one in that was one that didn't
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
come from Liz but um we we know there's
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
several districts that don't have
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement so all those
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
policy decisions are based upon what
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
clearly state law but where are all the
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
the districts within the co-op do they
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
all agree with what's going on it's
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know how those other co-ops
 
00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
don't have agreements how they function
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
how they review those
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
will review what they're doing
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and the L any necessary revisions to
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 195 or any other statute that may
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
uniquely impact a proper School District
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of wide open Deal
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
any other issue which the commission
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
deems relevant to the objective of this
 
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.190 align:start position:0%
deems relevant to the objective of this
study

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
so in in the one that you added about
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement I don't know
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
if it's maybe it's a silly thing but I
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
would put down written because I think
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
if they don't have articles of agreement
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's been like a
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
an agreement but it's not been written
 
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
an agreement but it's not been written
down

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and so maybe if you put written in
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
there then well I I think that's very
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
valuable and capped so a lot of these
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
articles we can't find you know we've
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
gone to doe and asked they can't find
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know how those districts are
 
00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:46.549 align:start position:0%
I don't know how those districts are
functioning

00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
a handshake
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
uh and and I I thought the ones that
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
don't have written articles agreement
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
are they functioning are they getting
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
are they the ones that wanted
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
I honestly can't tell you maybe there's
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
somebody here that can inform us there
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
were two districts
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
that don't have articles agree what's
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:15.740 align:start position:0%
I can't read from our discussion
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
previously it came up in the discussion
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah in fact I think Barrett was the one
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
who brought it up
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and how they're functioning now
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
on a handshake
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
Rick I would assume there is some issues
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
of past practice
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
that would cover the questions that
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell is talking about
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
that has been there for years and the
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
past practice is a common
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
common law issue where there's not a
 
00:32:59.769 --> 00:32:59.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
the last M any other issue which the
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
commission deems relevant to the object
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
objective of the study is kind of a wide
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
open you can study other issues that are
 
00:33:13.009 --> 00:33:13.019 align:start position:0%
pertinent to Cooperative school
 
00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:14.590 align:start position:0%
pertinent to Cooperative school
districts

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the benefits of a
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
the cost Savings of Cooperative school
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
district and that's all I would think be
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
part of this study
 
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.769 align:start position:0%
part of this study
yeah

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
um so Rick I think one of the one of the
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
things that jumps out to me though on
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is and I think this is what Linda
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
was talking about too is it's it's very
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
very prescript prescriptive and detailed
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to withdrawal or
 
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.570 align:start position:0%
when it comes to withdrawal or
dissolution

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
JK you know
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
um you know except yeah and then and
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
then you've got that sort of and
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
anything else that you might want to uh
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
uh you know come before the commission
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
as well but but
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
um being so prescriptive when it comes
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
to withdrawal
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if if maybe you know we
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
could sort of you know you know back out
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit and and look at the the
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
commission's duties shall be to um to um
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
I like the one that you put in identify
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
key elements required school districts
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
um required almost Cooperative School
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement I think that that
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's an important
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
um issue there and then you know terms
 
00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.609 align:start position:0%
um issue there and then you know terms
surrounding

00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
surrounding
um

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
not just withdrawal and dissolution but
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
what if another another uh pre-existing
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
School District wants to join
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
um you know something around that and
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
then we currently have a lawsuit pending
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the Rand suit which which challenges
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh funding of Cooperative
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
um it's specifically around Cooperative
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
school districts I believe all the all
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs um or the initial
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs were were Co-op School
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
District members of Co-op school
 
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.270 align:start position:0%
District members of Co-op school
districts

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and and you know that could certainly
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
contribute to criticism of um of you
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
know current you know current
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts if if um
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
let's say one you know uh taxpayers in
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
one town are paying a significantly
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
higher local property Local School uh
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
property tax rate than than people in
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
other towns and so perhaps that should
 
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
other towns and so perhaps that should
be

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
rolled into this as a high level thing
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
to look at particularly in view of the
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
fact that we've got a pending court case
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
I I think that's extremely important
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps when we look at the very
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
first Roman numeral one where it says
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're establish a commission study
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
issues related to Cooperative school
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
districts we could add in another
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
sentence or two in there to give an
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
overall purpose of this study which is
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
Broad enough to conclude some of those
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh topics of which have just been
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning to show the
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
rationale behind why we went there or or
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
why we have them what's the benefit that
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
comes from them versus uh yeah we
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand that two of the bills which
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
we have before us were dealing with
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
reapportionment withdrawal
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
and the last one uh and repeal
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts so that the
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
bills which we hadn't promised were
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
really at that withdrawal and
 
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
really at that withdrawal and
disillusionment

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
disillusionment
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that's from what I hear by
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
way of all the testimony of the years
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
those are the big issues how do we
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
reapportion membership on these uh
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
Cooperative boards how do we get out of
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
it if we don't like it uh how do we get
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
out of it if they're trying to change
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement where it's now
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
we used to be maybe uh based on your
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
Finance 100 admin average daily
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
membership now they want to throw in 50
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
ADM and 50 property valuation
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh all those things are causing concerns
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
out there when you so
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
like we said at the very beginning we
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
don't want to get down the nitty-gritty
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
and all this stuff but I think we got to
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
convey to the commission some of the
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
issues which have become for this
 
00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:25.579 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past and here they are
 
00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:27.170 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past and here they are
yes

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to mention to part of the
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
dissolution some of it should be done to
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
take care of the situation like in Derry
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
they are Cooperative school districts of
 
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
they are Cooperative school districts of
themselves

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
because I was Dairy and dairy Village or
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
something and that all went away but
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
they still are a Cooperative School
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
District so the the dissolution part of
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done like hey if there's
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
nobody left it's automatic or something
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
to that effect because Gary doesn't know
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
how to get rid of it you know we we
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how to get rid of virus
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
either up in Haverhill where I uh
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District of one town with
 
00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.300 align:start position:0%
seven at Large
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh members on the board
 
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.069 align:start position:0%
uh members on the board
um

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of drawing a blank here but
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
um with the with the Cooperative school
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
districts one of the things on on my
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
campaigning is that I've had several
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions about would it be more
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
efficient and cheaper uh for schools to
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
join in cooperatives or you know to have
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
the sau's not be all broken up into
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
little itty bitty saus like they are now
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I think there's there's not only you
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
know the louder voice obviously is for
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
the the breaking up of cooperatives
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
because somebody's mad but on the other
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
hand I think there are people out there
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
in the communities who are looking
 
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.829 align:start position:0%
in the communities who are looking
towards

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
um school funding savings uh by joining
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
together either you know the the SAU
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
which isn't a Cooperative but then with
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts as well so I I
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I think we should uh when we
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
have an overall study I think we should
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
look get both ways so you're you're
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
almost getting into the arena that
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the entire educational
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
structure and organization in the state
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
um that's what some of the other states
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
have grappled with they've you know
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
that's what Vermont did and that how do
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
we get away from all the duplication of
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
administration and these how many
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
districts do we have in in of the 30
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
co-ops there was like
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
174 or so small districts that are part
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the co-ops
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's uh and every one of
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
them has to have a you know a certain
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
Administration and all that there's
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
duplication for short uh and then how do
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
you develop the cost of that
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
Administration then that's there's a
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
fight on that
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
I think uh because we're on the western
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
side of of New Hampshire uh and we get a
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
lot of news from New Hampshire or
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont radio and TV and newspapers that
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
that that kind of sparked that
 
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
conversation since Vermont you know
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
really looked at the reorganization and
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
tried to see how they could uh entice
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
people to to join those small uh school
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
districts together so I think that's
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
where it's coming on my side
 
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.349 align:start position:0%
where it's coming on my side
representative

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
hey Mr chairman I
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
um I haven't been privy to the ongoing
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
study and I the committee's been working
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
on I do understand that the free bills
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you're focusing on do uh deal with
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
dissolving but I I have to support uh
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's concern when I
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
look at this as a first day in first
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
thing he gave us 10 minutes ago the
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
first piece the first item number one it
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
talks about issues related to corporate
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
school districts as the primary focus
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that's number one if it
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything there as Linda has
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
indicator that talks about the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
positiveness how to structure all those
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
things everything here when you get the
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
two three and four are valuable for the
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
disillusionment so I do think since the
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
number one piece that Doe put in there
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
on this commission should include the
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
positive ramifications of an options of
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts so I would
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
I would support representative's
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
concerned that this that as we go
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
through if it's the commission is going
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
to look at corporate school districts
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
there should be also the the a fair
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
presentation on the other side of the
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
board of how towns could do that that's
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
all so perhaps when we're represent
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
Woodcock when we make our
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations up or down that we don't
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
have to hand in the recommendations like
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
this in a legislative fashion we could
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
put down an uh an overall purpose
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
statement for why we're making this but
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
then have some bullets not in any
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
prioritization order but some bullets
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
that the that need a look at okay thank
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
you that might be one way of doing it uh
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
because we're we're not recommending
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation we're dealing with the
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
old legislation and so but we want to
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation that we didn't act
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
positively saying yes the bill goes
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
forward simply because there's too many
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
of these type of issues associated with
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
it that we're not ready to make that you
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
know recommendation one way the other
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
yet okay commission study thank you
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah further discussion on this
 
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.730 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah further discussion on this
one

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.849 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have to put all the
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
positives but I certainly think we need
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
to put how to join a pre-existing
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
Co-op and how to form a new co-op as
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
part of the list of things that we're
 
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.089 align:start position:0%
 
Rick

00:43:04.089 --> 00:43:04.099 align:start position:0%
Rick
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with that
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think if we're if if we're
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
looking to um to not recommend the
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
current legislative or recommend future
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation uh uh you know form a a
 
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:23.180 align:start position:0%
commission to take a comprehensive look
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
to review and Rec make recommendations
 
00:43:26.339 --> 00:43:28.550 align:start position:0%
to review and Rec make recommendations
for

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
for think for things including
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and dissolution joining in
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
formation you know you can't have the
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and dissolution yeah
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
discussion without adjoining in
 
00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:40.970 align:start position:0%
discussion without adjoining in
formation

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
formation
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
discussion too
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
um and the articles I think that was a
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
really good catch and um and I would put
 
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.370 align:start position:0%
really good catch and um and I would put
funding

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
um in there too since it's all part of
 
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
um in there too since it's all part of
it

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
and and I think though you know those
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
are four very broad categories that I
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
think would uh would provide a a decent
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
framework for um for a piece of
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay I got those down joining in
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
formation and funding uh and the in the
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
I I do think uh what we've discovered
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
this morning too is that obviously those
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
who have come before us
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
um have had issues had problems what has
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
been lacking in the conversation though
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
is where is it working
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the the last several
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments of uh committee members here
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
have indicated that there are places
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
where they are in fact working and uh
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
what is the best practices within those
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh co-ops that might help other co-ops
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
that are struggling so I think the the
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
expansion of the issue of the study of
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
co-ops is really Beyond just the
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal but how in fact are how
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
should they be working where are they
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
working where are their problems and
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
trying to identify that that whole scope
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
of issues
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah we don't we have about
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds that haven't really
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
communicated with us and so are we to
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
assume that's all fine are are there are
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement are they working
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
because they're all these articles we've
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
looked at what we could find and we've
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
looked at a good 15 or 18 of them
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
um in past years we found that all
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
different and some are very
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
comprehensive some are like you know one
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
or two pages and a lot of us you know
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
make your mind up as you go on
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
so where are the best practices
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
occurring and which are the articles of
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
agreement that really work we haven't
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
gotten all those we don't know and we
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't even know those that are working
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
well uh so this all makes sense I think
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
we need to you know find all this
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
information out before we throw it all
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
out with the bath water the whole works
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
and Rick to to your point on the on the
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
Articles uh I think it ties in with
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
Mel's point on what our best practices
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of operations because those two
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
things really you know I I think can can
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
can help
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know advise how to move forward with
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
with what what would be the things to
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
have in articles because as as your
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
friend um Bill ardinger said in the
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Concord Monitor yesterday he was on the
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the charter commission for Concord
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh the Concords Charter it's really
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's something that's that comes into
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
play during the breakup
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's not relied on for normal you know
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations and um and so you
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
know so having having good articles that
 
00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
are both both strong in terms of in
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
terms of um in terms of when when
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's conflict
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
um would also I think good articles
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
would be would be you know would it
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
would be good to have strong articles in
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
terms of you know solid operations as
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
well yeah and you kind of identify those
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
key elements that are within those
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
articles and they may all apply to every
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
District but in different ways because
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
your different sizes rural urban uh
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
demographic size of enrolled population
 
00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:33.950 align:start position:0%
demographic size of enrolled population
um

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
don't reverse non-donor
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh all that
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
represented cordelli thank you um with
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Articles
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the issues is
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
um requiring a periodic review of the
 
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
um requiring a periodic review of the
articles

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
articles
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
um put that in into statute but there's
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
a fundamental problem also with the
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
Articles because
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
um if they are again voted on by the
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
entire Cooperative District again it's
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
the larger towns that are going to
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
dominate and if the smaller towns who
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
have issues
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
um cannot make an impact in terms of the
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
Articles and changes to the Articles you
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
know we're back to the same situation we
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
are currently in right right but that's
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
up to the commission too that that's
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
more yes but that's a point that the
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
commission would need to look at
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's all about local control and that's
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
the different cult one to get around
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
some of the articles read that if you
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
change these articles during the time
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we've reapproved and maybe every
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
five years ten years some have never
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
done that if you change the Articles
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
without our approval we have a free
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
ticket to get out of the the co-op there
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
is one District like that that is about
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
ready to pull that card
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
so uh I think this whole study is very
 
00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
so uh I think this whole study is very
important

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and we ought to move on it and
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully if we can change you know and
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
summarize some of these instead of
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
putting the laundry list perhaps
 
00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
putting the laundry list perhaps
um

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
um if representative Tanner do you have
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
your hand up quickly yeah yeah I just uh
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
just to go back to the the commission uh
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
as a whole the the uh membership of it
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and I know because you said there is
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
a law now that you have to have
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislative uh more legislative uh
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
people on the commission but as I go
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
down through the commission there's only
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
one outside group those uh state school
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
board or not the state school board but
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
the School Board Association the rest of
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
the ones other than legislative are all
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
appointed either by the doe or the
 
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
appointed either by the doe or the
governor

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
um and uh I I think we need more
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
um diversity on that uh commission so I
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how much that's going to be
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
part of the recognition or uh
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation or even the final bill
 
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
but I would definitely look at the
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
representatives on there I think the
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more people that should be
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
on there than than uh that are outside
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the DOE outside of the appointment of
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
the governor see on on this that was the
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
next point I was going to get at as far
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
as conversation if you look at the
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
makeup of what is on this paper that we
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
received right now
 
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:25.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to see three
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
superintendents the uh and you're going
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
to see two school board members there's
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
five right there
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
and if you're only allowed to have
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
seven if you have a commission of 15
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
seven of which are going to be
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
non-elected officials five of them
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
already been reserved for the
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
superintendents and for
 
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.890 align:start position:0%
superintendents and for
um

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
School Board people uh but there's
 
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
others that we've we've heard from just
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
like Jim who testified from the attorney
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
perspective you have a what about a a
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
finance director a business manager of
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
of a co-op and and and informing folks
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
on on the nature of uh how business is
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
handled financially what about the
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
department Revenue Administration uh
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
should they be involved there should be
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
some Doe
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
so the at the makeup this is where
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
you're going to have technical support
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to get them
 
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
on what about the the parent who is
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
upset well I don't you know if it it has
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
to do with the Cooperative before you
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
put them on there it's just you know I'm
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
upset because I'm not getting special
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
education services I don't think that's
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
going to be relative to this study
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
um however the broader picture is that
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know how's that affected the
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
academic achievement of my student uh
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
that may be a an issue which you know we
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
want to know about too sure sure and I
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
think all of those things Rick
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
um you know and I think this is this is
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
a strong point about about having a
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
commission maybe even a multi-year
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
commission to to do this so that it can
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
have have substantial public comment
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
um where where people can share those
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
those concerns and have ample time to uh
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
to seek out testimony from
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
um you know from the the commissioner of
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
the dra and from from others that other
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups that that are
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
involved in um in in Co-op districts
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
so would it be wise for us just you know
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at this we should
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
also be writing in the technical support
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
shell include
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know and are we're not going to be
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
writing the Bill but in yeah
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get prescriptive but in
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
order we if you look at the commission
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and the membership yeah Jim Grenier
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
so he's from the house it kenweiler from
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%

with experience withdrawing from a
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District I think that
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
was Croydon wasn't it down that Donna
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
green yeah Timberlane okay
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
that that was the makeup of it and we
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
heard from Jim O'Shaughnessy a New
 
00:54:12.609 --> 00:54:12.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council of school attorneys
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
that he felt there needed to be more
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
financial knowledge on that board
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with some of these issues he
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last meeting
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
and he was going to get back to us I
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
tried calling him several times it's
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
hard to get through him
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
represent bone yeah thank you uh yeah
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is the size of
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
commission is I think 15 is pushing it
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
um you need to also get a quorum uh the
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
thing is like a lot of bills and and the
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
following will be invited uh they don't
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
have to be permanent members of the
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
commission they can be invited people
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
like from the dra or what not to discuss
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
specific items but over 15 you're
 
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:02.420 align:start position:0%
getting to be
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
ah it's gonna be hard getting I mean
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
I've seen commissions come up with like
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
33 members and that's ugly ridiculous 15
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
is I think the top limit we should have
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
from for at least getting a quorum and
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
getting I mean with more than 15 you
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
might not even be able to agree on
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
anything so I think 15 is fine Liz do
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
just want a point of clarification so on
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
my list the recommendation was that
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
certain folks were appointed by the
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
State Board of Ed not by Department of
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
Ed those are different entities and I
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that the
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I noted as we were
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
going through this is the state board is
 
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.549 align:start position:0%
going through this is the state board is
given

00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
um several obligations with respect to
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts and the state
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
board has really been sort of outside of
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
the realm of any prior study commission
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they at least need to be part of the
 
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.890 align:start position:0%
and they at least need to be part of the
conversation

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
um so maybe either by representative of
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
the state board on that commission
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
um or have some participation so just
 
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
want to make that clarification that
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
those folks are not going to be
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
appointed by the agency but were
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually the suggestion was they'd be
 
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
appointed by the State Board of
 
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.510 align:start position:0%
appointed by the State Board of
Education

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:29.900 align:start position:0%
and then the importance of including
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
a discussion of the obligations of that
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
state board because for example they
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to review the
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
withdrawal plans if they're submitted
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
and as you know there's an issue right
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
now before the State Board
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
regarding you know a vote to withdraw
 
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.950 align:start position:0%
regarding you know a vote to withdraw
that

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.670 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
didn't go through successfully so they
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
the State Board certainly has
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
obligations under the current statute so
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
part of probably needs to be part of the
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
conversation but also part of the issues
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
that are discussed to make sure that the
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
duties and obligations that they are
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
given are clearly defined and things
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
that they can you know perform because
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
if it's vague and unclear or not clear
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
Direction it's uh moves things open
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Allison thank you
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just uh I'll comment on the
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
composition of the of the uh of the
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
commission uh it seems when people have
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
said this but I'm just supporting it
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
seems very much skewed toward the
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch if you include the
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and the governor
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
they're appointing nine people at this
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
commission as far as I read it we get
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
basically the legislative branch gets
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
four members uh and in terms of sort of
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
the division in terms of responsibility
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
and I'm aware of some of that between
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
the state board and the actual
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education given the
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
meeting current meaning of the minds
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
between the commissioner of education
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the State Board of
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
Education I'm not sure there's a whole
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh be a whole lot of difference in terms
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations that came forward
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
so I think it is this membership if it's
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
capped at 15 which it is has to be much
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
more balanced than what's showing up on
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
this sheet here and by balanced uh you
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
mean that for example if it's a
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
15-member commission or some odd number
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
less than that the majority is going to
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
be elected representatives senators
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
is it possible that elected
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
representative could also come on with a
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
lot of understanding about school boards
 
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:36.740 align:start position:0%
having been a school board member or
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process could have been
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
involved with that or could have been
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
involved with a a co-op that works just
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know wonderfully
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
so I I think that when I look at that
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
list initially how we had it in the
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
years past
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
the membership was kind of siled
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
um from this organization from this
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
organization I'd rather see people
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
appointed to a commission and find out
 
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:08.339 align:start position:0%
what do they bring to it as an
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
individual not just because they're
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
elected or Not Elected but what do they
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
bring that's going to and what do we
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
need on there to have a good
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of discussion
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
if you don't or the knowledge of who to
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
contact I I think that's the important
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
part so we got what kind of resources
 
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:28.940 align:start position:0%
we'd want in all these different people
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
all right I just I and I should have
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
said I I certainly agree with with your
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
intention the intention of people here
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
of including as many knowledgeable
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
people in this process as possible uh in
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
terms of technical assistance and
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
committees and so on uh what I'm raising
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
is what is the composition going to be
 
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
of the group that makes the final
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
decision when the votes are taken really
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference with the
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
technical assistance committee said it's
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
the people who are on this commission
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
who will make a final determination
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately I assume on legislation or
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation for legislation so I that
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's my I I just want to be clear that
 
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
I certainly support the idea of lots of
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
people being involved in the process
 
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.750 align:start position:0%
people being involved in the process
foreign

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're now discussing
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
what the future bill is going to be not
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to stay with this
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
thing on the interim study which we
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
pretty much all agreed to that that will
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
be it we have plenty of time to discuss
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
what the bill is going to be when we get
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
the bill so I think we're going further
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
than we should be right now
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
um I would uh respectfully disagree
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
about individuals versus
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
um organizations I think uh that when
 
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:54.020 align:start position:0%
you have like a Carl Ladd from the
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
Superintendent's Association that that
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
person then represents uh the general
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
feeling of superintendents in the state
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
if you have just one superintendent from
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
one particular area they they're just
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
representing their particular area which
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
then can can get skewed so when you do a
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
Statewide commission I think you need to
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
look at a mix of maybe an individual but
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
also have representative from the
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
organization just like you're having the
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
school boards association with Barrett
 
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.609 align:start position:0%
school boards association with Barrett
Christina

01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
Christina
 
01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:34.849 align:start position:0%
Christina
foreign

01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think representative Bowman's correct
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
this would be a decision that needs to
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
be made but I think the makeup of these
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
commissions is extremely important uh
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that the governor in past
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
when he's appointed people has tried to
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
look at that in terms of people that are
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
bringing some knowledge certainly did
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
that when he appointed Bill ardinger to
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
the commission that you had
 
01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
is there anything else on this that we
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
okay let's look at the individual three
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
bills right now
 
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay in the first bill which is
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh 1366 relative Cooperative School
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
Board reapportionment
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
how is what's the feeling up or down on
 
01:02:44.099 --> 01:02:47.329 align:start position:0%
how is what's the feeling up or down on
that

01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
is anybody uh wanting this to move
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
forward we got to make a recognition
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
here's the sort of getting back to what
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
we started to talk about at the top of
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
this if um if we're not recommending
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
either of the any of these bills in
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
their in their specifics but instead are
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
recommending that the legislature
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
um assemble a uh a commission to do a
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
um then that I think having having our
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
having a three sentence uh report that
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
um that you can draft on the fly right
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
now could give us a you know a sense of
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
of how we want to vote on these uh these
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
bills because I I you know I think I
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
think maybe this could go to I mean I'll
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
just put out a straw man
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
um that that that the committee does not
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
recommend this this bill
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
in specific but does recommend and this
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
would be the common for all three does
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
recommend a comprehensive commission to
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
to study uh issues to study matters
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
um of Cooperative school districts with
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
respect to to at least the following
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
areas withdrawal dissolution joining in
 
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.270 align:start position:0%
areas withdrawal dissolution joining in
formation

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
formation
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
um articles of agreement funding and
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
best practices and operation and and
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
just sort of leave it at that that's
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
exactly right not get into membership we
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
need to take action in each bill though
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna have to make that same
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
motion for each bill right right but if
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
if if that was it if if
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
um if we knew what those what that one
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
sentence or what that one you know yeah
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
um okay so then what we need to do right
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
now then just to make this easy so we
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't string this thing on too much
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
longer we'll we'll make that motion and
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
make it appropriate to each of the three
 
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.970 align:start position:0%
make it appropriate to each of the three
bills

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
um when we have that motion if we all
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
agree in that process that's what I'd
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
like to hear right now because if I
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't see that now we haven't made a
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
decision to pass on to the executive
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
session and that's what we want you know
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
when we exec the three bills so is
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
everybody favorable behind what was just
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned represent cordelli yes
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
um since this is uh
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but a committee of the
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
whole and on the 24th we have a
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole do we have to
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
have a vote
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
um today there are a number of members
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
missing today
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be uh better just to
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
delay any vote until we have a true
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
executive session uh with the committee
 
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:33.140 align:start position:0%
of the whole
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
no we we are in a subcommittee and as I
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned yesterday
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
that even though the folks unless we
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
haven't finished studying the bill
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
but I think at this point with this bill
 
01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
and three bills I think where there's
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
nothing else to be gotten and so we we
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
should make a recommendation at this
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
point in time as a sub committee uh
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to do that you know we
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
could do that on the 24th at the same
 
01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:06.470 align:start position:0%
could do that on the 24th at the same
time

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
but my feeling is that we're all pretty
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
much going to be on the same page here
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
anyways right now so Rick I'd be happy
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've a motion made by represent
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
luno SEC my represent boom so that that
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
we uh that and this applies to all three
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
bills I don't have the numbers in front
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
of me yeah um
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
um that uh that that that that while the
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
committee does not recommend this bill
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
for further legislation it does
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
recommend the legislature assemble a
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
commission to study matters
 
01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's your first sentence second
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah these matters shall
 
01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:58.670 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah these matters shall
include

01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and dissolution joining
 
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.349 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and dissolution joining
information

01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
funding and operating best practices and
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
I would put other matters as pertain to
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts yeah yeah
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
that's that would be the last point of
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay okay
 
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.410 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay okay
okay

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:20.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:23.299 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any discussion on that
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
we're done with that now okay and that's
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
times three that's that's three times
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
three so we're done that those three
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
bills are taken care of we're going to
 
01:07:37.329 --> 01:07:37.339 align:start position:0%
take a five or five minute break here
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
before we get into the next bill
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm just gonna copy it right
 
01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:45.470 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm just gonna copy it right
now

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
did you get a copy of what he just said
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
but yeah no
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I thought you were writing oh that
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you've you've got it though
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead and start
 
01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:13.460 align:start position:0%
on 1680.
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee interim study work on on
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
this uh bill has
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of commission studies in
 
01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:25.100 align:start position:0%
the past task force studies in the past
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and here we go in terms we we are
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
now trying to come up with some
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
resolution on 1680 here
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of uh the recommendation
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
from this committee I passed out several
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
sheets here
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
which I asked this sheet right here the
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
one which has all those these districts
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
on it uh yesterday I I met with uh
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
Jennifer for uh to ask for information
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns it's just one that's
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
I I've thought of a lot lately is that
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
we have some districts that are wealthy
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
districts and we know that we saw from
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
the commission report too where there
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
were outliers on just about everything
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
we did or in Liars whatever you want to
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
call them and and
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
um where for example there's a high
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
number of dollars that are driven
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
towards and make up the uh cost per
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
pupil and equalize valuation per pupil
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
is also High however their achievement
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
scores are not where you think they
 
01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:34.940 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh given the nature of that community
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of reasons for that I
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of variables some are
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
our funding some are non-funding
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.709 align:start position:0%
our funding some are non-funding
variables

01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
variables
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
and so what I'd like to do is just take
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
a moment if we can here because before
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
we do any kind of recommending or moving
 
01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.129 align:start position:0%
we do any kind of recommending or moving
forward

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have today everybody here at
 
01:28:59.810 --> 01:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
the table that's got
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
um uh either a a made-up position you
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
know or you've already resolved where
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
you are on this or you haven't uh to put
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
your cards on the table and please let's
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
have an honest discussion right now so
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
try to address some of the critical
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
issues that the 1680 was bringing
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
forward and there are some issues in
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
1680 that are very pertinent and that
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
proposed to where we need to go or where
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
we want to go in terms of learning in
 
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.649 align:start position:0%
this state
um

01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to look first at this uh
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
small little sheet which was put
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
together it comes from I platform I exp
 
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
the I explore from doe uh Jen do you
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
have a moment that you could come on up
 
01:29:52.320 --> 01:30:02.030 align:start position:0%
have a moment that you could come on up
please

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
Jen in this uh you were able to put this
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
together uh for me just the other day
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
um dealing with these various districts
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the districts we know
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
um someone like if you're a co-op and
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's towns or districts within the
 
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.610 align:start position:0%
there's towns or districts within the
co-op

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
the towns are listed in several
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
different pla they're listed as a
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
separate District because they might
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
only be a K3 a K4 k6 but they're also
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
listed under the co-op as well uh so but
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
then going across equalize valuation per
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
pupil you can see what uh that is in
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the formula that we were giving
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
some fiscal capacity disparity Aid
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I like to call it we were
 
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
a figure to start a starting point to
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
move downwards and as we went downwards
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
towards the lower level of Equis
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
property valuation the amount that they
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
receive per pupil increased
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
um average cost per pupil Proficiency in
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
math Proficiency in English language
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
arts uh whether it's economically
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
disvantaged students based on free and
 
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
reduced the percentage
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
and the enrollment numbers and then the
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
medium household income is also listed
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
there and these are all components that
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
come into our thinking on how to direct
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
monies in any formula
 
01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:27.380 align:start position:0%
um to where there is need for that money
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and and also as an attempt to see if
 
01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
the money which is being received is
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
being used efficiently uh towards the
 
01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:41.060 align:start position:0%
the area of the we measure
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
that outcome which we're looking for in
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
in the commission study there were I
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
believe three outcomes which were
 
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:51.380 align:start position:0%
measuring from the Statewide assessment
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
attendance and graduation numbers
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that yeah and so it was
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
those three in in statute we have a
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
number of indicators which we measure
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
that from everything from the ASVAB to
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
you know uh the going on the
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education there's a
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
number of them uh disciplined in the
 
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
schools Etc so Jen could you walk us
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
through this a little bit try and
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
explain what the different shades of
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
black and gray are here
 
01:32:24.179 --> 01:32:25.370 align:start position:0%
black and gray are here
sure

01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so what what I did was pull
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
um all of the data points from the I
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
platform on the department of
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
education's website except for the
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
median household income that comes from
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
from the U.S Census Bureau
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
um the I platform
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
produces information by district and
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
there are 164 districts that are listed
 
01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.430 align:start position:0%
there are 164 districts that are listed
here

01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
this is all 2019 data
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and like representative Ladd had
 
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.590 align:start position:0%
um and like representative Ladd had
mentioned

01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
where there is a Cooperative School
 
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
where there is a Cooperative School
District

01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
um from cordelli mentioned that Exeter
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
is a good example where Exeter
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is I think a six through 12
 
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
Cooperative than each of the member
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
towns are listed separately
 
01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
towns are listed separately
um

01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
with their K to six or k to five
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
um districts but all the data is
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
District level data so the proficiency
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
is is by the specific District
 
01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.050 align:start position:0%
is is by the specific District
um

01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
in terms of the shading what I did is
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
once I compiled the data I just used um
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
the quartile function in Excel to break
 
01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
the quartile function in Excel to break
down

01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
quartile so you can see relative
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
from District to District
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um which conditions are perhaps more
 
01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.470 align:start position:0%
um which conditions are perhaps more
favorable

01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
favorable
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
um the flaw or or what I I think you
 
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
should keep in mind when comparing the
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
districts is it doesn't account for
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
district population
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
so the quartile data isn't going to
 
01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
align perfectly with Statewide average
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
data because you're comparing in some
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
cases an 80 student district with a 13
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
000 student District so some of that
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's not it Compares things
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
differently than if you are looking
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
um at all the student performance in the
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
state so if you look at page six of the
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
packet it shows how those quartiles are
 
01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
broken down for each category
 
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.110 align:start position:0%
broken down for each category
um

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I also noted the Statewide averages
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
for each category
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
and then the last page gives you
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
information again from I platform that
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
defines each of the indicators that are
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously on the printout you can't
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
see the color coding so I am going to
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
send you around electronically the um
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so that you can
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
have that visual
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
impact better than what you can see here
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
and it will also allow you to sort by
 
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there reps and boom
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
I I did similar thing many years ago on
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
education funding and one of the same
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
reasons I will not vote for any funding
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
that includes median household income
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
and a good example of that is for
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
example town of Litchfield
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
both parents work as compared to
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester which has a lot of single
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
parent houses and if you look at theirs
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
compounded to median male income a
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
median female income it's the median
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
household is nearly the same if you look
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
at it for Litchfield for example the
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
median you add the two together and you
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
get the median so it's not a fair
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
comparison to use median household
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
income anyway so I just wanted to bring
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
that up and it and for example Hudson
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is nearly identical Litchfield it
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
shows in nearly half
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
and and that's because there are
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of single family
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
single uh
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
provided for single provider household
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
in Hudson that's compared to Litchfield
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not a fair comparison I mean
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
both parents like in Midfield and a lot
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
of the other towns you see the high
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
numbers is the only reason it's high is
 
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
because both parents have to work in
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
order to live where they're living so I
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
mean that's why I will never vote for
 
01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:52.739 align:start position:0%
anything that has median household
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
income because I went through this years
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
ago when we were doing the same type of
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
and why isn't Dairy on the list
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is completely everything that came
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
out from
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the I platform data I didn't add or
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
take away any of the districts they're
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
missing you
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
magnetic ended up
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
so Rick yes just a question on on
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
Ralph's um comment there and and I I
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
agree with what he said and nothing in
 
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
actually nothing in 1680 uh relies on
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
median household income as part of the
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
funny formula but our current and what's
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
being proposed well it uses free and
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
 
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:53.950 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch
right

01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
which is different than median household
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
income it's a it's a poverty indicator
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
for the or socioeconomic status
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
indicator for um uh for students and uh
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's very clear from the um I'm
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
also looking at the same database that
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh that Jen used and I mean we had a
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
really nice presentation of it from from
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh the department what a couple weeks
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
ago and just looking at the economically
 
01:38:26.930 --> 01:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students percentage versus
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in math
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
um and uh and there's a it's a very
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
strong correlation uh there with um with
 
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
with students from economically
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged um uh backgrounds
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
performing uh significantly worse on the
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
um on our Statewide assessments than uh
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
than students in more affluent
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
um uh households
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
so if if we look at a town like a
 
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.629 align:start position:0%
so if if we look at a town like a
moultonborough

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
moultonborough
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm not picking on it but I'm
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
picking on it only because I'm looking
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the recoice valuation is seven
 
01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars per pupil
 
01:39:11.219 --> 01:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
million dollars per pupil
um

01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:16.689 --> 01:39:16.699 align:start position:0%
and their average cost per pupil is 25
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
687 dollars
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
and you look at the performance in
 
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
and you look at the performance in
mathematics

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
what was the state average in
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
mathematics can you Recology 49 49
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're below the average
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
so they're 42 percent
 
01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
so they're 42 percent
um

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh where
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
I I'm concerned that
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
how do we direct dollars
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
to assist those communities which have
 
01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
low performance in a certain subject
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
area or area of learning
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
yet they have the ability within their
 
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.490 align:start position:0%
yet they have the ability within their
community

01:40:00.490 --> 01:40:00.500 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's a that's a question
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
Dave yeah
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and Rick I mean I think that's
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's something that we spent a lot of
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
time in in the year 2000 on Zoom uh
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
talking of talking about and um and and
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
I think we we you know we focused a lot
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
of discussion around the um uh the
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that came out of
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
the Londonderry lawsuit and um and where
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
where um where I think it I'm not
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
recalling the the the specific language
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
I know it's in the commission report but
 
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.610 align:start position:0%
I know it's in the commission report but
um

01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
but but I think um you know some critics
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
have used the Londonderry decision as to
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
support a first and last dollar approach
 
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
to funding an adequate education uh but
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the Londonderry decision
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
um uh necessarily goes goes to that
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
effect but uh but very important I think
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
for um for the state to look at its
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
obligation to providing the last dollars
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh in making sure that every district
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
has access to the resources they need
 
01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
and I think that would apply to to a lot
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the um the underperforming
 
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.770 align:start position:0%
of the um the underperforming
um

01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:29.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:31.940 align:start position:0%
districts where students are are
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
performing below the state
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh the state average and making sure
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
that that they have um you know the
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to uh to fund an adequate
 
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.310 align:start position:0%
dollars to uh to fund an adequate
education

01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's the that's that's
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
the rub and I think you and I yeah uh
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know battled over this but your data
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
here is is
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
is is I mean what you're what you're
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
talking about is directing State funds
 
01:41:59.810 --> 01:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
where they're needed
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
as opposed to on a universal uniform
 
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:03.770 align:start position:0%
as opposed to on a universal uniform
basis

01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yes the premise
 
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.669 align:start position:0%
yeah yes the premise
on

01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
formula which Bill and your Dave and Mel
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
put together their bill you put it
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
together probably our dick excuse me
 
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
um uh was built upon that Doe 25 form
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
right wasn't it it was about
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
20 000 or so at what was no it was B
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
so it's 17 plus
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay well it was it was it was based on
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
it was not based on the average cost for
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
a student
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh it was it was it was based on all
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
of them sorry I didn't have my speaker
 
01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.850 align:start position:0%
of them sorry I didn't have my speaker
on

01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
um the um the the commission study
 
01:43:03.729 --> 01:43:03.739 align:start position:0%
analyzed all of the doe 25
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
FY 19.
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
because we did the study in in 20.
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
and Dick correct me I mean you know I'm
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
hoping if I'm getting this right here uh
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
and and it looked at
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
how districts spent their budgets and
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.830 align:start position:0%
how districts spent their budgets and
and

01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
normalized that with with what the
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
outcomes were in those districts was
 
01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:39.860 align:start position:0%
there was there an assumption
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
that due to the fact that New Hampshire
 
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
consistently is seen in comparison to
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of states in America
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we have very good achievement
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
and so is there an assumption made then
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
the the this average whatever it is
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
amount for the pupil cost should be
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
enough to maintain that level of
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
achievement if we're all yeah so so I
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
think that works when when looking at
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole but when you start
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking at individual school districts
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
the um the the average student in
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester does not
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
um does not necessarily isn't identical
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
to the average student in um in New
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and so the the the student
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics in Manchester are very
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
different than the average student
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
characteristics across the state so what
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
what the what the commission study found
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
is that in some districts
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
the um the the average cost per student
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve a Statewide outcome
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
this very strong Statewide average
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
outcome is going to cost more than uh
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
than in other districts and um and so
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
that you know I think you know what the
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
the commission's findings really move us
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
away from a uniform cost and and fund
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
model to a a cost model that um that is
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
specific by District because every
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
district is well not every District's
 
01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
totally different but um but uh you know
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:28.340 align:start position:0%
the the student the the
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
challenges that that Manchester has just
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
aren't the same as the challenges that
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh that Hopkinton has or that Hanover
 
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
has and it's not the same as the
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
challenges that Berlin so let's take a
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
look at Tamworth on your on your sheet
 
01:45:42.179 --> 01:45:44.750 align:start position:0%
look at Tamworth on your on your sheet
yeah

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
um Tamworth has a free and reduced
 
01:45:48.659 --> 01:45:50.330 align:start position:0%
um Tamworth has a free and reduced
population

01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
of 54 percent
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it's a poverty-stricken area
 
01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:56.300 align:start position:0%
according to that
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
their equalized property valuation
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
though is 1.3 million which is you know
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
on the high side compared to many
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
and yet their proficiency area in
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
mathematics is 26 percent and they're
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
spending 28 000 per student right yeah
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
and they've got 185 kids out of the 155
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
kids 160 000 that uh that we've got
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide so how does this formula we're
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
talking about address this particular
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
need of that town well I could uh I
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
could I could take a look at the the
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
company remember we developed through
 
01:46:34.209 --> 01:46:34.219 align:start position:0%
our our um our Consultants with air
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
developed a district calculator and we
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
could specifically look at at Tamworth
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and see what uh see what it would
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
recommend for a um for funding uh level
 
01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.609 align:start position:0%
recommend for a um for funding uh level
I

01:46:48.609 --> 01:46:48.619 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't forget cameras is only in
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
see I I yes yes it is it's not our whole
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
system yeah but that's that's good to
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
know and and the um the the Air Research
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know did take a look at at what what
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know age groups are being served
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
and and not all got factored and that's
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
why going through the ms-25
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
in detail is really essential when
 
01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
determining the uh a funding model and
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh not just looking at the yeah
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
so can you then when you're looking at
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
that calculator for that particular
 
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.149 align:start position:0%
that calculator for that particular
community

01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
compared to what they receive now by the
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
current Formula what they what would
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
they be receiving in the Foundation
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
program that you're proposing
 
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.350 align:start position:0%
program that you're proposing
so

01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
let me get Tim work so we're talking
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
about Tamworth let me pull up the
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
calculator I don't have it yeah
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
so go Rick this is going to take me a
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
minute okay so when you get that yeah
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cornell Thank you um I are
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
there ways to look at other things like
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think in our discussion the other day
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about how students in
 
01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester at certain elementary schools
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
enter school not ready to learn at all
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
not even knowing their colors but we're
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
maybe in Lebanon because they've had
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
parents sitting home with them reading
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
with them or they've gone to preschool
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
for three years old four years old and
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're entering school probably reading
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
so is there a way to know if Tamworth
 
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
are they entering School first grade
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
maybe not ready to learn because they
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
and so by third grade they've not caught
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
up and their test scores will be lower
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they're not entering with that
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
advantage that other districts might
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
have entered with see Patricia represent
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
Cornell that's okay
 
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.090 align:start position:0%
Cornell that's okay
um

01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's you're sort of going down the path
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm going down that there are a
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
Associated issues
 
01:48:58.619 --> 01:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
Associated issues
which

01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh May uh control
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
to some degree the kids are coming to
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
school education in the family
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
aspiration of the family aspiration of
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
the community economics within the
 
01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:14.780 align:start position:0%
demand for jobs within the community
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
leadership in the building which I think
 
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
is absolutely in line number one that
 
01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.350 align:start position:0%
is absolutely in line number one that
um

01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
leaderships it sets tone and and would
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
staff uh on on how learning progresses
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
and some of those issues you know you
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
may say yeah it's Associated to some
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
degree with money however we have
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
schools which are uh performing very
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
well in some of these communities where
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
the per pupil uh equals per valuation
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
per pupil is low and the uh ability of
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Town support through property taxes
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
is also low but they're achieving and
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's I I come down to the fact that all
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
the time how do we how do we measure the
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of leadership is that part
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
of why we're seeing some schools down
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
and some schools up but if we
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
if money toward the communities where
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
the kids are entering school at a
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
disadvantage could those communities not
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
use that money to provide a preschool
 
01:50:24.490 --> 01:50:24.500 align:start position:0%
program for those kids or to Target
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
programs to kindergarten first grade
 
01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.179 align:start position:0%
second grade to catch them up you know
 
01:50:34.689 --> 01:50:34.699 align:start position:0%
have smaller classrooms have have more
 
01:50:36.729 --> 01:50:36.739 align:start position:0%
reading and math
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
Advantage classes I think we've been
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
doing that in many schools that through
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the title one program funds and all we
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
we you'll see some schools saying well
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep the pupil teacher
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
ratio low in the grade schools but
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
expanded as we get up in the grades
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can do some of the things
 
01:50:56.810 --> 01:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
you're talking about prior to getting to
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
grade three
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh so that that's part of the equation I
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
also handed out another sheet to you
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
this one right here which just came in a
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh educational Journal just this week
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
and it shows that similar access to
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
effective teachers for low and high
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
income students is the same
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
you have some teachers that are
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
effective and some that are not
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
effective these exist in the say at the
 
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
same level in
 
01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:30.350 align:start position:0%
same level in
wealthy

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
wealthy
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
towns where you have a wealthy
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
population and those where you have a
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I had two comments on the overall
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
thing one is the fact that we're heading
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
for aiming for the average
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
and we may be top in or one of the top
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
in the country but that's not saying
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
much we're like 33rd in the developed
 
01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:04.490 align:start position:0%
much we're like 33rd in the developed
world

01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the proficiencies what
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
was it 42 and a half or something like
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
that is something we should be aiming at
 
01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
I think we should be aiming above that I
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
think we should be aiming at proficiency
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
as opposed to average proficiency and
 
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
given that both from things we see here
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
and from that graph we saw
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
there isn't super good correlation
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
between money spent and outcome and
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
we've we've seen that looking on it but
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
we've saw that there
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things I really like
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
program is the whole section on for
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
failing schools as far as I'm concerned
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
42 and a half is a failing school and 65
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
is a failing school we're talking about
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
proficiency we're not talking about
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
Excellency we're just talking about
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
Precision proficiency
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think that should be applied
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
before we start divvying up money or
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
changing money I think we need a couple
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
years of apply that whole section where
 
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
they have to come up with a program for
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
how they're going to improve their
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
outcomes they're going to have you know
 
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
all that whole section that's a great
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
section I say let's put that in place
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
give it a chance to
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
have a fact and then look at it and see
 
01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:31.940 align:start position:0%
where we're at before we start giving
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
money when money doesn't seem to have
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
any real correlation to outcome so so
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
um couple things on on that point and
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
and um and I I agree I think the
 
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
accountability section in in 1680 is is
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
is very strong uh but at the same time
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
um we need to we need to have a Level
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
Playing Field to make sure that um well
 
01:53:58.330 --> 01:53:58.340 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things that that that
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
districts have access to the resources
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
they need in order to have effective um
 
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
you know in you know instruction and
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
programming in their districts uh and uh
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really clear from from you
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
know the work that the commission did
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the report that that Jen has has Jen
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
and Rick have provided that that
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts a lot many many districts just
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't have access to the uh to even the
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
the resources for um for even a even a
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
basic um budget but the you know another
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
important objective behind the
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
commission's work and I agree I would I
 
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
would love to have all of you know New
 
01:54:39.129 --> 01:54:39.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students are the average
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
student performance in New Hampshire
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
much higher than it is right now I mean
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
being top five in the US yeah I mean
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's better than being bottom five in
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
the US but you're right compared to the
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the world
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
um we could be doing a lot better than
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
that but but one of the commission's
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
objectives here was really closing the
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity Gap so it wasn't it wasn't
 
01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
to increase the average student
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
performance in New Hampshire but to
 
01:55:07.810 --> 01:55:07.820 align:start position:0%
increase the average student in
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
performance where where where where in
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
in many districts it's so far from the
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
from the from the average in New
 
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that these kids just
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
can't get a fair shake and um and you
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately you know Patty you're
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
always at the end of this with
 
01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.770 align:start position:0%
always at the end of this with
Manchester

01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
um you know Manchester and Newport
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
um student performance is um is at the
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
bottom of the state and both both are
 
01:55:38.649 --> 01:55:38.659 align:start position:0%
challenged economically both have um
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester has significant
 
01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.070 align:start position:0%
Manchester has significant
um

01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know pop student populations that
 
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
come from low econ socioeconomic
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and and how many languages
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
are spoken 60 something in the
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know Newport doesn't have those
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
same challenges but they have other
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
challenges and the um you know the
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
objective was really to close those
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps and and I'm hoping that
 
01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:12.659 align:start position:0%
that the legislature will um will will
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
see an opportunity here and not say well
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know average in New Hampshire isn't
 
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
high enough and until we see it you know
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
double or be better than pick another
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
country that we do nothing
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
um because I think that's where that's
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
where too many kids are just being left
 
01:56:35.570 --> 01:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
out of our economy right now
 
01:56:38.169 --> 01:56:38.179 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:41.219 align:start position:0%
you know we could we could be doing a
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
lot better with the money that we're
 
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
that the state is currently spending
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's another big point of 1680. that
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
that um that it's not it's not saying
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
hey we need to put in
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
um uh some you know additional huge
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
tranche of uh of State dollars it's not
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
saying that and um and I think it
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes some very practical things
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
too that while while certainly the
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester school district is the most
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
underfunded in absolute dollars because
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's also the largest that that the
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District wouldn't be
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
able to absorb
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
um uh you know all in one year that
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
complete tranche of money so it would be
 
01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:27.500 align:start position:0%
phased in over a decade and um and and
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
similarly the um any sort of tax rate
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
impacts that that districts might see
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
would be would be uh would have
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
transition grants that would be phased
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
out over five years and uh and so
 
01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
reducing the um you know the uh uh you
 
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
know the the the you know taking the
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
shock out of the system and uh and I do
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
have the uh the information for Tamworth
 
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.250 align:start position:0%
have the uh the information for Tamworth
okay

01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
also Rick
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
yes represent Ford
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
I'm a big concerned only thank you
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a bit concerned that this is seen
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
only in the brown from the lens of the
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
financial part of it
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with students in Manchester
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
specifically I don't have their names
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
but I know who they are and they come
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
from non-english speaking families and
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
they are knocking the socks off their
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
competitive English-speaking people in
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
various programs
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
and it's not because they are
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged in some ways they have
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
they take that and run with it they're
 
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
in a program now for developing their
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
own businesses
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
and this is coming from another source
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
outside the school system
 
01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't accept this data as being
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
valid because it doesn't speak to the
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
aspirations or the education of the
 
01:58:55.139 --> 01:58:56.330 align:start position:0%
aspirations or the education of the
parents

01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
and I think you'll find more answers to
 
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
this problem there than you will find
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
several of you may remember when I was
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
showing a book around about children and
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
and work in the workforce with Lewis
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hines the photographs and pointed out
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
members of my own family
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
Barefoot picking cotton in north Texas
 
01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
cotton fields
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
what I didn't say in that though was
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
every single person in that photograph
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
had all of their children go to college
 
01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
and these were cotton Pickers barefoot
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
with no money
 
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
I think they're missing a big point of
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
the point here when you say it's only
 
01:59:46.689 --> 01:59:46.699 align:start position:0%
about the finances are in the community
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
there are whole cultural things at work
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
here and I think they in addition to
 
01:59:54.649 --> 01:59:54.659 align:start position:0%
this chart here we have to ought to know
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
what are the educational backgrounds of
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
what do we get plus or minus from that
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
so what what data are you taking
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
people my wife is working no no no
 
02:00:09.649 --> 02:00:09.659 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm saying or is it the
 
02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:11.420 align:start position:0%
the proficiency
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
just the the economically disadvantaged
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
students and you're assuming that
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
performance is not necessarily going to
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
be good unless their economics are
 
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:23.930 align:start position:0%
be good unless their economics are
improved

02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
improved
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
so so it's not simply a matter of
 
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
Economics is my point
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
right but the the the doe data that has
 
02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
been collected and was presented to us
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and this is on the the I
 
02:00:38.159 --> 02:00:40.129 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and this is on the the I
explore

02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
explore
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
um function that Nate and his colleague
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's it too yeah this is the data that
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
Jen Jen used and it's got a correlation
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
of minus 0.68 which is pretty strong
 
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:56.060 align:start position:0%
correlation between
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantage students and lower
 
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in math I think we I
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
understand there is a relationship
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
between being economically disadvantaged
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
and performance there we've gotten that
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
data we've had it over a number of years
 
02:01:16.129 --> 02:01:16.139 align:start position:0%
um but I mean I'm hearing I'm hearing
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
from Oliver that that he doesn't believe
 
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
that dude my my concern is that there
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
are situations which don't necessarily
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
follow but what we you know see for the
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
whole and I'm concerned that in any kind
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
of a formula which we develop
 
02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
there should be
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
accountability for sure that we just
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
handed this sheet and I'm going to look
 
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
at where representative Woodcock comes
 
02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:48.020 align:start position:0%
from here Conway
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
and look at the equalized property
 
02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.530 align:start position:0%
and look at the equalized property
evaluation

02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
look at the per pupil expenditure per
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
child cost and look at their achievement
 
02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
child cost and look at their achievement
scores

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
scores
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're not good
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
how but see they have a valuation of one
 
02:02:06.599 --> 02:02:07.790 align:start position:0%
how but see they have a valuation of one
point

02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
or 1.5 million dollars per pupil
 
02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
and they're spending 18
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
000 per pupil
 
02:02:17.050 --> 02:02:17.060 align:start position:0%
um they have a 38
 
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:24.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:26.219 align:start position:0%
you know it is
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
but with that type of Revenue available
 
02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:30.659 align:start position:0%
to them shouldn't they have this score
 
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
higher if we're going to pour more money
 
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
into sending to other districts in hopes
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to improve those districts
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
but we see in fact unless money is
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted which we cannot do
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
Under the current constitution
 
02:02:47.219 --> 02:02:49.490 align:start position:0%
Under the current constitution
interpretations

02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
interpretations
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's what I understand I'm not a
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer but we cannot Target a
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and perform and and
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
base adequacy money that is basically
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
going to the town and a school district
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
and they use it
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
do they use it for these students I
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
so is there are there other issues here
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that come into play I'm all for many
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
components within the foundation for me
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
believe me I I advocate for a weighted
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh amounts of money for various
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
categories which are unfunded by the
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
federal government and we're not
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
receiving that from the state either and
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's costing us a significant problem
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
in our schools
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
so how do we address my concerns here
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
Dave yeah yeah so so so I think first of
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
all it starts with defining and costing
 
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
inadequate education and and currently
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
we Define an adequate education as a
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
classroom with with with 30
 
02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:50.219 align:start position:0%
um students a teacher 1 500th of a
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
principal you know a principal for every
 
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
500 students one librarian for 500
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
students it's a bag of stuff that that
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day costs about four
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
and and we've we've heard I think from
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
from from our many hearings over the
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
last several years that uh that there's
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
no school district that no Public School
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
in the state that um that would be able
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
to um to put on anything close to to
 
02:04:23.089 --> 02:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
what they consider to be an adequate
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
education for for four thousand dollars
 
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then with that conversation
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
right there
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
so if if the base adequacy right now is
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
and and we're basing that on a formula
 
02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
which is 25 to 1 for K through
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
three I believe and four through four
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
through twelve it's Thirty to one
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the task force back in 2018 I had
 
02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
recommended that we drop that down to 20
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
and 25.
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
now the if we drop down K through three
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
and taking our K3 students that's that's
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
four grade levels and with 164 000 kids
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
divide you know you can find how many
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
kids that is multiply it by the an
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
additional sum of money which would be
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
going out to based upon that formula is
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
that not a way to address and and fix
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
our funding absolutely and and in fact
 
02:05:24.169 --> 02:05:24.179 align:start position:0%
that's what 1680 does is it um it
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
recommends a base amount of enough five
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
thousand yeah it's like five to six
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so it's a little bit
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
higher than we currently does have and
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
then it has
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
um a differentiated Aid
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
um weighted value it's weighted weighted
 
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
dogs but it's the same same basic thing
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
as our differentiated you know the
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
additional dollars for special education
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
English language Learners free and
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and um and uh 1680 does
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
not do third grade reading but it does a
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
school size
 
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.410 align:start position:0%
school size
um

02:05:56.410 --> 02:05:56.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and we can argue over all
 
02:06:02.209 --> 02:06:02.219 align:start position:0%
of these things but but what the base
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
plus these differentiated factors do is
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
get you closer to what a school
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
district's budget would look like to
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
educate all of its students so for for
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
places like Hopkinton hey I represent
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton people at Hopkinton but
 
02:06:22.209 --> 02:06:22.219 align:start position:0%
hopkinton's uh you know for for for
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
hopkinton's average student to perform
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
at a Statewide average Hopkinton doesn't
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
have to be spending what it's what its
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
current budget is so from places like
 
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and Hanover it ends up being
 
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
with a lower predicted budget for those
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
school districts for places like
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester it ends up being
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
significantly higher predicted so
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
predictive budget Dave this seems to be
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
a discussion between you and I yeah um
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
so Hanover we know is well-educated
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
community and they're they're you look
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
on the chart here and their achievement
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
score is going to be wonderful yep
 
02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and they're spending and they've got
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
strong budget yeah and so
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
and yet and you look at Hopkinton or you
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
look at Gabriel you're going to see not
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
the type of results that you see in
 
02:07:12.070 --> 02:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hanover no Hopkinton you get those rooms
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision right now in
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and all that
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
we have to allocate to these students
 
02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money regardless of
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
poverty or wealth so so how's this
 
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
formula that you have get around that
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
decision of the courts okay
 
02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so we don't believe it's getting
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
around the decision of Courts because we
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that I don't believe
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say we don't believe I I
 
02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:40.460 align:start position:0%
don't believe and and and I and
 
02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
particularly with with advice and
 
02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
discussion from from two lawyers who who
 
02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
have who we've all know and and you and
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
I have have worked with Dickens bill
 
02:07:54.239 --> 02:07:55.729 align:start position:0%
I have have worked with Dickens bill
ardinger

02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
ardinger
 
02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
um you know have been through every step
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
in this uh don't believe that that's
 
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
what the court
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um uh meant by that and uh the court had
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
never seen
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
um a um uh a formula uh like what a like
 
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing in 1680 which is
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
directing the precious State resources
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
to where they're needed currently
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
and over gets the same amount per
 
02:08:23.689 --> 02:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
student from the state as as Pittsfield
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
does as Berlin does as her people per
 
02:08:30.649 --> 02:08:30.659 align:start position:0%
pupil as rye and Newcastle do and and
 
02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:32.300 align:start position:0%
and and and and and
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
all of those towns have significantly
 
02:08:36.179 --> 02:08:38.089 align:start position:0%
all of those towns have significantly
different

02:08:38.089 --> 02:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:08:38.099 --> 02:08:38.689 align:start position:0%
different
um

02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
access to financial resources and uh but
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
they get the same amount of funding from
 
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire all 1680 is
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing I mean among the in addition to
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
the accountability section and and the
 
02:08:56.209 --> 02:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
tax set the um the property tax relief
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
section and stuff like that is um is
 
02:09:01.250 --> 02:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
taking the billion dollars that the
 
02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
state raises
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
650 million from business profits tax
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
business owners and price tax and a
 
02:09:10.129 --> 02:09:10.139 align:start position:0%
smattering of other taxes plus the 363
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
million it gets from the Statewide
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
property tax and and pushes that out to
 
02:09:16.970 --> 02:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that districts can fund
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
reasonable budgets because if we say as
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
a legislature that a reasonable budget
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
is is
 
02:09:26.209 --> 02:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
forty two hundred dollars per student or
 
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:28.340 align:start position:0%
whatever it is right now base plus
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy we're we're I don't know what
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're what we're saying because there's
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
no there's it's not rooted in in
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
anybody's reality it's not rooted in
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester's reality and it's not rooted
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
in Hanover it's real it's not rude in
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
any reality but if we recognize that
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
that that reasonable District budgets
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
um for an adequate education for a
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide education
 
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
um should range anywhere from and I'm
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
not looking at the numbers but but
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're gonna they're gonna they're
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have a range
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
um depending upon the the student
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
District characteristics anywhere from
 
02:10:12.490 --> 02:10:12.500 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars per student to
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
twenty four thousand dollars person
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
something like that that that as long as
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
it as as these school districts can um
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
Can can raise the first dollars locally
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and get the last dollars they need
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
to to make them whole on on on on a
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
predicted budget for that District
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
then then the state I think is is doing
 
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
the job the courts and the Constitution
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
really intended but the courts haven't
 
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
ever seen New Hampshire do anything like
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
that before Vic can talk about this a
 
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
lot if you're talking about the
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts model here um I'm talking
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
about the Massachusetts model and my
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
understanding from dick and from bill is
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
that the Massachusetts Constitution is
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
very similar to the New Hampshire
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution when it when it surrounds
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
when it pertains to Our obligation to
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we keep talking about how much uh
 
02:11:18.169 --> 02:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
Town spends for
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
per pupil spending and I'm saying it's a
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
whole lot more complicated than that you
 
02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
look at for instance Lisbon Regional
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
their equalized valuation per pupil is
 
02:11:32.209 --> 02:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
only six that 634
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
000 whereas Manchester it's eight
 
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
hundred and five thousand you look at
 
02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.050 align:start position:0%
hundred and five thousand you look at
their

02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:38.060 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged and they're
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
re they're fairly close they're in the
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
same ballpark
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and yet the average cost per pupil
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
for Lisbon is 17
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
000 and Manchester is twelve thousand
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
well the big difference well so number
 
02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.530 align:start position:0%
well the big difference well so number
one

02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
the people in the town vote for what
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
their spending is and number two
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're completely different sizes one
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
is huge one is at the top end and the
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
other is at the bottom end and so you
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
can't just look at oh twelve thousand
 
02:12:15.729 --> 02:12:15.739 align:start position:0%
you got to realize that there's a lot of
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
savings due to size right yeah but
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's not that's you know Patty should
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
be here for this oh I'm sorry I didn't
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
realize you'd laugh but but but but the
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester has yeah has has
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
other extraordinary needs
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
um because it's so much larger than any
 
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
other city or town in the state and I
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
believe it also has a tax cap and I
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't think the voters in Manchester
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
approve the school budget I don't know
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
how that's it's not it's not left to the
 
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
voters in Manchester it's the council
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
but it's not that it's now yeah yeah but
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's not the state either it's still the
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
locals whether it's the people elected
 
02:13:02.689 --> 02:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
by the locals who do it but it's not the
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
state who does it but my point is they
 
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
still have a lot more equalized
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil than Lisbon does and
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
yet Lisbon spends more per pupil than
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
how much of that is because they vote to
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
spend more and how much of that is just
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
because there's economy of scale
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated is what I'm saying
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you can't just look at
 
02:13:29.569 --> 02:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
the property values you can't just look
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
at the amount they're spending because
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
you know how much of that comes from
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
what we don't it's way more complicated
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
and so basing on these simple things you
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
can see right there it doesn't work
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and and and and and and
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know and I I'm not trying to get
 
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
down into the weeds of of of 1680 but uh
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
but it does recognize that there are
 
02:13:59.209 --> 02:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for larger school districts
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
so in in those areas Manchester actually
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
does not um receive any any benefit
 
02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
because of its um school size uh in in
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
terms of uh predicted costs
 
02:14:14.209 --> 02:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
um uh however it does have such a high
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
number of English language Learners that
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
it does receive differentiated aid for
 
02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
um uh for that
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
um and and again just looking at the at
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
the school and student related factors
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
but I think Patty could probably tell
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
you about a lot of other factors outside
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester School District that
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
affects that affects the total tax rate
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
that Manchester residents
 
02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
um you know pay for what fire and police
 
02:14:42.649 --> 02:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
safety and other I things that go beyond
 
02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
Shannon Tanner
 
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just um
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the sheet that was passed
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
out for 2019 which is was an unusual
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
year and it's a one-year look at one
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
year snapshot of the schools in the
 
02:15:02.219 --> 02:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
year snapshot of the schools in the
state

02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and you're bound to have outliers and
 
02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
the smaller the school is the more
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
variation you're going to get over a
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
number of years so if you really wanted
 
02:15:14.330 --> 02:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
to you know compare data a little bit
 
02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
better I would suggest that you do a
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
five-year average and certainly covet
 
02:15:23.450 --> 02:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
changed a lot of of uh scores and
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
everything else I think the other thing
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
is that you need to look at Apple
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
samples you know when you're looking at
 
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
the proficiency of kids in the United
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
States or New Hampshire versus uh the
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
United States or versus other countries
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's not Apples to Apples and and I
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
guess my third point is that
 
02:15:45.169 --> 02:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
and it goes to what Dave's been speaking
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
about there's so many factors within the
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
community and the longer the community
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
has had a poorer performing school like
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
Newport uh more poverty uh less industry
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
or or professional people moving into
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
the area because they come they have a
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
job and they say okay where's the best
 
02:16:05.089 --> 02:16:05.099 align:start position:0%
school district in the area Newport
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the nod and so it's become a
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
lot of slumlords uh that have bought up
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
property from out of state that just let
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
the property go which exacerbates the
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
the whole it's a spiral that goes down
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
so even if you when you at least start
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
something like this it's going to take a
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
while for things to to actually make any
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
kind of turnaround but I it certainly is
 
02:16:34.089 --> 02:16:34.099 align:start position:0%
um at least from living in Sunapee
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
representing Newport representing some
 
02:16:39.169 --> 02:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
other towns that I did in my floaterial
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know Dave's right there's a lot of
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
factors the preschool how many how many
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
parents actually send their kids to
 
02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
preschool that would be one question I'd
 
02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
have with Tamworth versus maybe Newport
 
02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
they certainly offer preschool but how
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
many parents send them to preschool so
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
um you know we're dealing with children
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we're dealing with Learners and
 
02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
Learners are hard to fit in pegs they're
 
02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
not widgets like in a business so
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
whenever you try to make data and data
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
points it's difficult and there's going
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
to be outliers but and you try to do an
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
average so that you get to see it and um
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know in those schools with 42
 
02:17:20.929 --> 02:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
percent math you might have a couple of
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
really math whizzes you know and you
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
might have a couple of kids that are
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
have rumorophoria or whatever it is but
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's like dyslexia with math I mean we
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
don't we don't even take that into
 
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
account like we do dyslexia and some of
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
the other issues that we've identified
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
in reading so
 
02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:41.099 align:start position:0%
I would just caution everybody about
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
grabbing these and looking at Lisbon or
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking at Tamworth
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
um you know 2019 again wasn't a great
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
year and and uh certainly it's it's a
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
one-year flash of what's happening in
 
02:17:56.270 --> 02:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools in response to
 
02:17:59.089 --> 02:17:59.099 align:start position:0%
that uh represent Tanner
 
02:17:59.099 --> 02:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
that uh represent Tanner
um

02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
we're taking the information that we
 
02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
should we have available to us and it's
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
limited from Doe
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we we can go back further and uh some
 
02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
of these low math scores which we're
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
talking about are nothing that's been a
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
result of uh not necessarily resultant
 
02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic 2019 is actually free
 
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
that's pre-pandemic so we're looking at
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
it but we are looking at
 
02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
seeking more information that's the
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of the analyst over at doe to do
 
02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
that so we can track one cohort as they
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
grow through the grades one thing about
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
Lisbon you're looking at Lisbon there
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
and that's within my area uh Lisbon if
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
you drive down 302 it looks like a bomb
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
went off in places
 
02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a very very wealthy community
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
at all but their scores are above
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in both mathematics and in
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
language arts reading
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
and it's because they have outstanding
 
02:19:00.770 --> 02:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
leadership and staff in that school I've
 
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
seen it they have a wonderful Athletic
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
program too in soccer I can tell you
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
that they've beaten Haverhill
 
02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:07.370 align:start position:0%
that they've beaten Haverhill
um

02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:08.450 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
people just won a state championship the
 
02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
other night
 
02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
other night
um

02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
in that division but at any rate
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the the school district also relies
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
with a very close relationship in Lisbon
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
with New England wire which is a a
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
company which does business throughout
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
this world and in in fiber optics and
 
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
all that and it's huge so
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
there are these outliers that have high
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in there or above the
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
proficiency level
 
02:19:41.209 --> 02:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
that are weak on the equalized property
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
valuation as Lisbon is if you look at
 
02:19:44.929 --> 02:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
that you're going to see it in well well
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
below a million dollars I'm sure
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
and and and then if you look at their
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
achievement scores they're just a little
 
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
shallow the 50 Mark they're well above
 
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
the 42 percent Mark 40 probably 47.49 in
 
02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
that area
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
so how do we direct the money to these
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
particular districts and if you look at
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
their poverty level it's well up above
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
so they're they're one that has the
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
poverty they have these very unique and
 
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
difficult issues but somehow they're
 
02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
showing good achievement
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of where we place the bar and I
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand sometimes representative bar
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
is too low to the ground
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
um for proficiency and we go in terms of
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
our academic standards maybe we've got
 
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
to raise that a little bit so we can
 
02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:33.710 align:start position:0%
to raise that a little bit so we can
really

02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
compete worldwide and direct more
 
02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
attention to how we're teaching and
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
identifying what our curriculum should
 
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
be representative yeah let's step back
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
just a moment
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
um when the current when the current
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
system was created
 
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
years ago way before all of our thoughts
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
they really only had one thing to look
 
02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:58.550 align:start position:0%
they really only had one thing to look
at

02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
and that was to look at things
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is what David said earlier
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
things this is the input model the way
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're currently funding schools
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
Things based upon average salary of
 
02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
Things based upon average salary of
teachers

02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
principles how many desks you've got
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
there that's all they had at that point
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
in time
 
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
and they came up with a formula and they
 
02:21:24.889 --> 02:21:24.899 align:start position:0%
have okay based up all that everybody
 
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
gets four thousand dollars period
 
02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
that was okay then
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
they did not have the data sets that we
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
if you look to see what the Department
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
of Education has been able to do with
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
the form 25
 
02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
Etc we've looked at some of the data
 
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
they've had there's a whole new set
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
of criteria that you can base how we
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
fund schools
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I think what 1680 is trying to do is
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
to say okay let's take this new data
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
and let's see how we might be able to
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
reallocate the current way we're funding
 
02:22:01.439 --> 02:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
reallocate the current way we're funding
schools

02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
and reallocate them in a way that's
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
going to help those areas that need more
 
02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.450 align:start position:0%
going to help those areas that need more
help

02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
so that's one point so just think about
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
the old system and a potentially new
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
system based upon data that we've that
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't have when the old system was
 
02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:20.389 align:start position:0%
we didn't have when the old system was
created

02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
created
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
the second thing that we haven't talked
 
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
about here yet
 
02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
and that is what the commission really
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
focused on too
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
is that how do we make sure that
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
students in this state
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
have equal access to an adequate
 
02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.330 align:start position:0%
have equal access to an adequate
education

02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
and that's being fun that's being
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
focused on how do we create a Workforce
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
within this state
 
02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
that there is some comparability around
 
02:22:48.170 --> 02:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
the state so if you want to have if you
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
want to have a business that's going to
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
go into Claremont for example or Newport
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
they can look at the students there and
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
say gee these kids have the same kind of
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity as they do in Hanover in
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and in in Hopkinton Etc
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is how do we as
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
state officials
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
begin to look at how do we look at all
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
students across the state
 
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they have an equal
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
access to a good education and let's
 
02:23:20.929 --> 02:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
face it in some school districts they
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
have great access other school districts
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
they don't have access and by the way
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
we've got data now that can tell you
 
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
we've got data now that can tell you
that

02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
and back to the point that that uh was
 
02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
made earlier
 
02:23:35.210 --> 02:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
right now when we allocate funds to
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
schools there is no way to say well is
 
02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
it being effective
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
this system for the first time
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to say hey
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
school districts let's see exactly how
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
well you're doing
 
02:23:54.290 --> 02:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
and if you're not doing well there's a
 
02:23:56.210 --> 02:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
five-year plan here in this system I
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
think it's five years
 
02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
to begin to move to see where you are at
 
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
the end of that five years if you've
 
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
gotten additional money that's never
 
02:24:05.929 --> 02:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
happened before
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that what the
 
02:24:10.330 --> 02:24:10.340 align:start position:0%
commission's work did it's it it
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
revolutionizes the way we fund schools
 
02:24:15.889 --> 02:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
and it revolutionizes the way we look at
 
02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
how we can help kids who may be in those
 
02:24:20.450 --> 02:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
school districts that don't have the
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
same opportunities as other kids that
 
02:24:25.250 --> 02:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
are in more wealthy school districts
 
02:24:27.530 --> 02:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I do I just Rick I just wanted to
 
02:24:29.809 --> 02:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
make those two points of how we funded
 
02:24:29.819 --> 02:24:30.770 align:start position:0%
make those two points of how we funded
it

02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's obsolete right now based upon the
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
data that we have and secondly how do we
 
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
begin to reallocate the current funds
 
02:24:41.090 --> 02:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
not additional money coming into the
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
state the current amount of money that
 
02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
we're spending how do we reallocate that
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
in a more effective way than we
 
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
currently have as a one-size-fits-up
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent cordelli uh just
 
02:24:55.370 --> 02:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
following up on that maybe we should
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the uh CSI and TSI schools who are
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
the lowest performing they are getting
 
02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
additional resources additional funds
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
what happens after five years in those
 
02:25:10.849 --> 02:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
schools are they showing Improvement we
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
should look at that as well
 
02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
so thanks thanks again and this has been
 
02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
a good a good you know robust discussion
 
02:25:22.969 --> 02:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
I think that's important but I think one
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that that um
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
maybe and Rick I think you were really
 
02:25:32.270 --> 02:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
moving us to focus on this and maybe
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
this should really be the focus on on
 
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is whether or not the legislature
 
02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:39.650 align:start position:0%
this is whether or not the legislature
believes

02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
believes
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
um that that the state is obligated for
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
to fund the first and last dollar of um
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
of of uh for a public education for for
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
public schools or uh or whether it can
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
direct or Target State funds where
 
02:26:00.429 --> 02:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
and so so yeah so for first and last
 
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
dollar I think that this goes to the to
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
what Mel was saying in terms of how
 
02:26:11.809 --> 02:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
Antiquated our our school funding
 
02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
approach is but it's been
 
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire has always lowballed
 
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
this cost of inadequate education I
 
02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
think even the current cost somatic but
 
02:26:26.809 --> 02:26:26.819 align:start position:0%
education was was create needed to make
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
sure it fit within whatever funds were
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
were coming from the state of New
 
02:26:31.859 --> 02:26:33.050 align:start position:0%
were coming from the state of New
Hampshire

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and um and packaged to be uh to to
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
comply with with a
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
um the the interpretation of a Supreme
 
02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
Court decision saying New Hampshire's
 
02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
got to pay for all of it to find an
 
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
adequate education and pay for for all
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
of it so while we've got school
 
02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
districts that are that are spending
 
02:26:58.730 --> 02:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
um well like Waterville Valley average
 
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh forty three thousand seven hundred
 
02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
thirty two dollars per student and just
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
to keep us on the same page Rochester
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand twenty one dollars per
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
student doesn't matter you're going to
 
02:27:11.809 --> 02:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
get forty two hundred dollars per
 
02:27:13.370 --> 02:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
student from the state whether you need
 
02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
it or not so Waterville Valley spending
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
forty three thousand dollars per student
 
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
Rochester spending fourteen thousand
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
dollars per student both get the same
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
amount of funding from the state and
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
both have very different student now
 
02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
outcomes as well from based on
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
um based on the the report that that Jen
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
provided so so I I would have a hard
 
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
time imagining out of fairness that and
 
02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
out of out of student fairness for
 
02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
students that that that you know I don't
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
want to presume what the Supreme Court's
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
going to do but I'm not an attorney but
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
you look at something like this it
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it doesn't yell out to me
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah the states just got to
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
provide the first and last dollar the
 
02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
first of the you know the forty two
 
02:28:06.650 --> 02:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars first and last dollar of
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
a lowballed cost of inadequate education
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
where this is what districts are
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
spending this is what districts are able
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
to to raise through local property taxes
 
02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
and in Waterville Valley that's 43 732
 
02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
dollars with uh 2019 math proficiency at
 
02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
89 and Rochester
 
02:28:30.290 --> 02:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand twenty one dollars
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
with math proficiency at 43 percent and
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the state says yup
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're just going to buy the same stuff
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
pay for the same stuff for the same
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
amount for both of these um school
 
02:28:47.809 --> 02:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
districts uh I you know a pecking
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley is kind of a you know
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
and we all know what that is but but you
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
know what it even it even makes the
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
point even more more valid because if
 
02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley through its local
 
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
property taxes can can go above and
 
02:29:05.929 --> 02:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
beyond the forty two hundred dollars per
 
02:29:07.849 --> 02:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
student it gets from the state and raise
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
another thirty thousand dollars per
 
02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:11.330 align:start position:0%
another thirty thousand dollars per
student

02:29:11.330 --> 02:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
um to uh to uh uh pay for public schools
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
why are we even sending them the 4 200
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
to begin with I mean I think it puts a
 
02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
to begin with I mean I think it puts a
serious

02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
serious
 
02:29:25.969 --> 02:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
question into what our priorities are as
 
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
a as a state and and um to say that
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
watero Valley you're going to get it and
 
02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:32.929 align:start position:0%
watero Valley you're going to get it and
and

02:29:32.929 --> 02:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:35.570 --> 02:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know Manchester and Rochester you're
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to get the same well within our
 
02:29:39.530 --> 02:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
own statutes not even going to the
 
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's a shared
 
02:29:43.730 --> 02:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility yeah yeah and so
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
um well you know this is this is a
 
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
healthy discussion and and uh there's a
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
lot a lot to it now what I'd also like
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
to do is just take a moment here because
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
I know we're getting on lunch but I just
 
02:29:58.010 --> 02:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
like to say that there are certain
 
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
strengths to the 1680 that I have always
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
appreciated and the the performance
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
outcome we need to be measuring students
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
and and and making sure that the dollar
 
02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
is achieving what we want it to do
 
02:30:19.969 --> 02:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh the accountability section is strong
 
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we shouldn't be
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
lifting that accountability section and
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
putting it into anything everything we
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
do uh but there there has to be
 
02:30:31.969 --> 02:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
accountability for the dollars that the
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
state is Raising to support schools so
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's got to be
 
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
the other thing which I think is
 
02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
important is that there are certain
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
areas that we have uh where those
 
02:30:43.969 --> 02:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid elements
 
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
um very difficult you know I know when I
 
02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
um very difficult you know I know when I
was

02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:30:49.370 --> 02:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
years ago up in Anchorage where we had
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
48 different languages in the school
 
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that Community it was a smaller
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
about 250 000 uh people living in
 
02:30:59.389 --> 02:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
Anchorage itself
 
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
and that was very very difficult to
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
raise the dollars necessary to hit that
 
02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
specific need of language English
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
language Learners and special education
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
as well when the federal government
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
copped out and what they said they were
 
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
going to be doing and so we are picking
 
02:31:17.929 --> 02:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
up the difference especially the locals
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
picking up a tremendous unfunded amount
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
of money that's where the weighted
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
formula I appreciate I don't know if I
 
02:31:26.450 --> 02:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree of multiplying four
 
02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:27.469 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree of multiplying four
point

02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
tour something like that times the five
 
02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:31.190 align:start position:0%
tour something like that times the five
thousand

02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
added on but the whole principle in the
 
02:31:35.809 --> 02:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
concept is good
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
lastly there's other areas like that
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
which I appreciate uh I'm not so sure of
 
02:31:45.410 --> 02:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
of of uh using the doe 25 form I don't
 
02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
want to go into that you've heard me
 
02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
before on that
 
02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:48.889 align:start position:0%
before on that
um

02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
as is trying to set some kind of a
 
02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
a funding amount to start with to ensure
 
02:31:56.690 --> 02:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
that we're going to provide that
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education or that where we want
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
that bar
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
and the whole accountability for but no
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
matter what we do we're always going to
 
02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
fall on that hole that 90 95 I would say
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
close to 100 percent of all the states
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
you don't fund based on program you fund
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
upon what's in the state too
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh you make it work and that's
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
what we've done in this state since
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Ogden Blick to the current uh uh Senator
 
02:32:28.010 --> 02:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
Estabrook formula to what we've done in
 
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
18 and what we're doing right now it's
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
always been what we have this type of
 
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
dollar we'll we'll figure out a formula
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
to equate to that dollar it's not about
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
program and that's typical throughout
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
this country though
 
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's very much so uh maybe Massachusetts
 
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
is an outlier I don't know but uh I'm
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure that there's some issues down there
 
02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:51.710 align:start position:0%
sure that there's some issues down there
still

02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
um with some of those talents that you
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
were poor
 
02:32:56.929 --> 02:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
um they're probably having to kick in a
 
02:32:58.610 --> 02:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
02:32:58.620 --> 02:32:59.870 align:start position:0%
little bit more
so

02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
um that's my two cents right now I think
 
02:33:03.969 --> 02:33:03.979 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is wrap in a second
 
02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're not going to come to resolution on
 
02:33:08.210 --> 02:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
this at this moment I know we're not but
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think there are some areas where we
 
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:12.190 align:start position:0%
I think there are some areas where we
can

02:33:12.190 --> 02:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:14.819 align:start position:0%
meet and move forward
 
02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to to work with rep San
 
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
luno here and trying to resolve that so
 
02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
when we come together
 
02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
at the next meeting which will be on the
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
24th we're going to have to make a
 
02:33:29.450 --> 02:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this uh whether we
 
02:33:31.610 --> 02:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
move that say if the whole bill is
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful the way it is it should move
 
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
forward I don't I don't think that's
 
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to get you know a a pass like that
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of elements within
 
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
it and a lot of principles and Concepts
 
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
behind it which should be moving forward
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
into whatever we do in education funding
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming year here
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're getting back
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
into a hold harmless there with that
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
five years to hold harmless well if
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to last us for five years
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's not too bad but I I will not go
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere with stabilization ever again
 
02:34:07.849 --> 02:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh with any formula
 
02:34:09.770 --> 02:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I hope we all agree on that so there
 
02:34:11.570 --> 02:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
are some points of agreement that we can
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
come to together on
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
um so reps and boom did you have a
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
comments just a comment on because when
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
I studied this some years ago
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and I looked in Manchester
 
02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if that 12 000 per
 
02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if that 12 000 per
student

02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
includes the millions they get from the
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
federal government for the foreign
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
students the language language Learners
 
02:34:40.849 --> 02:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
because I know that was a lot of money
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
some years ago and I'm just wondering if
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's part of the 12 000 or is that
 
02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
just state and local
 
02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
well I think that's something I'm not
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
talking Grant programs like bilingual
 
02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:55.090 align:start position:0%
talking Grant programs like bilingual
education

02:34:55.090 --> 02:34:55.100 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I remember looking at the uh the
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
different data some years ago and it was
 
02:35:04.250 --> 02:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the amount of money that Manchester
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
and even Nashville but Manchester even
 
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
more for the uh number of students that
 
02:35:12.889 --> 02:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
the federal government was
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
paying at the time for English language
 
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
Learners and and that kind of issue so
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that there are federal
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in Esser for that right
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah is that part of the twelve thousand
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.939 --> 02:35:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:46.100 align:start position:0%
and and rev it has revenues as well
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
revenues expenditures and assets oh
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:53.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:35:53.770 --> 02:35:53.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:35:58.250 --> 02:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:35:59.690 --> 02:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I just want to go back to a comment
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
you made a minute ago about the
 
02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
historical perspective of budget
 
02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:04.250 align:start position:0%
historical perspective of budget
preparation

02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
preparation
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
just went through back in the series of
 
02:36:09.290 --> 02:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
it and I think that's I think that's the
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
attentive system where we want to be I
 
02:36:14.330 --> 02:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
think we have to create a plan
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
then budget the plan which this does
 
02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
versus create a budget and back into a
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
plan and that's the historical
 
02:36:23.929 --> 02:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
perspective you take the dollar and
 
02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
you're back into it I think we have to
 
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
look at the other way create what we
 
02:36:29.929 --> 02:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
need to do or create the plan and then
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
budget that in versus just taking divide
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
as I just falling off because I just
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
agree I'm budgeting I understand a
 
02:36:37.849 --> 02:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
historical perspective but I think it's
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong process
 
02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:40.570 align:start position:0%
the wrong process
yeah

02:36:40.570 --> 02:36:40.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
and and Rick I think you know and you
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
mentioned it before too and I think it's
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that that 1680
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you know really establishes a
 
02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:53.389 align:start position:0%
um you know really establishes a
framework

02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
framework
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and and more than anything else I
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
mean obviously it's got a lot of details
 
02:36:59.210 --> 02:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
in there but the framework is really
 
02:37:03.050 --> 02:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
important and that framework relies on
 
02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
on both the shared responsibility
 
02:37:08.929 --> 02:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
between State and and local
 
02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
um uh between the state and the and the
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
the city or town and um and what uh what
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know recognizing that that that
 
02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
um that cities and towns have uh have
 
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
different resources and that the state
 
02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
can come in with with its again it's
 
02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
precious dollars and deploy them where
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
they're where they're needed most and um
 
02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know and I and I think
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
that's that that really is I think in
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
the in the spirit of of the partnership
 
02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
that we have between locals and um and
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
um really as opposed to a first and last
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
dollar you know approach that doesn't
 
02:37:53.809 --> 02:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
get any school district anywhere close
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to an operating budget thank you
 
02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:04.990 align:start position:0%
to uh to an operating budget thank you
okay

02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.040 align:start position:0%

a different topic for those who served
 
02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
with a new barber shop I just want to

say Manchester
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
