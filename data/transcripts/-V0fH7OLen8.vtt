00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
on house bill 417
 
00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
and i was informed senator gaiden that
 
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
a re-written bill that you wish to share
 
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
i consider this arguably one of the most
 
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
i consider this arguably one of the most
important

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
films this session because you're
 
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the checks and balances
 
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
dealing with the checks and balances
over

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that was drafted over the
 
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0%
represents uh the work
 
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is similar in some respects and not
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
similar in others
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's the reason here is i think it's
 
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
imperative that we arrive at some
 
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
agreement we cannot continue to operate
 
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
or you can read it yourself whichever is
 
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
your preference
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
the soul has totally rewritten the bill
 
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 align:start position:0%
correct yes you should hit the hot
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
center gotta get the high points sure
 
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
all right so the governor has the power
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
to declare the state of emergency
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay it lasts for 30 days as soon as
 
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.030 align:start position:0%
okay it lasts for 30 days as soon as
practicable

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
practicable
 
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
the governor has to notify speaker and
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
the senate president for the impending
 
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
the senate president for the impending
issuance

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
issuance
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
whether he knows he's going to do it
 
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
and he has to provide the description of
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
the works orders okay
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
we also can declare state of emergency
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
current resolution of the house and
 
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
current resolution of the house and
senate

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
has to specify nature with the emergency
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
very subject to it conditions that
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
brought it about the duration of the
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
emergency if it's less than 30 days
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
this will terminate automatically 30
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
days unless it's renewed from the
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
same procedure set forth above so the
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
governor would notify the house and
 
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
governor would notify the house and
senate

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
leadership and then it says
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
i can continue to renew it as many times
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
as necessary to protect the safety
 
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
um if he finds that it's no longer
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
justified the governor issues an
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
executive order terminating
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
it legislation terminated or any
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
emergency order issued there
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
by the current resolution adopted by a
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
majority vote in the east chamber
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
power to review the state of emergency
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
to renew a declaration shall terminate
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
once such a resolution is adopted
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't conclude him from declaring a
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
new state of reverse for a different
 
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.869 align:start position:0%
new state of reverse for a different
problem

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
remember the house or the senate
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
or legislative officers or staff can be
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
essentially prevented from coming to
 
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.350 align:start position:0%
essentially prevented from coming to
conflict

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
to do business uh considering whether or
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
not to terminate an emergency order
 
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
some reason that people can't travel
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
we're exempt from that to come down to
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the emergency orders
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
it says no federal state uh i'm sure no
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
federal private or other non-state
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
is grant for funds essentially over a
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars should be
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
accepted until it's approved by the
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
governor chelsea admitted to the
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
chairperson and the
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
report that the fiscal committee does
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
not approve within five days
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
by business days the governor may accept
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
and expend the funds without further
 
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:36.230 align:start position:0%
and expend the funds without further
action

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
by the fiscal committee okay so that
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
says the fiscal committee
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
has been notified and doesn't care to
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
act on it
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
the governor can do it to us
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
that would be my understanding of this
 
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
that would be my understanding of this
yes

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
it doesn't accept or reject it
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances requiring expedited action
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
for the immediate health safety and
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
welfare of the citizens of new hampshire
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
the government has so authority to
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
accept and extend funds to iran
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
and it says as well the governor has a
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
duty to provide a list of all
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures pursuant to the supervision
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
of your state diversity to the executive
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
council for informational purposes
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
for purposes of transparency that's the
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
best basic build we're starting from
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily well
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
it represents right in my mind it
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
really change what we already have
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
the clever gives them seven more days
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh it's taking away any check
 
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.870 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh it's taking away any check
that

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
the legislator legislature has on on
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
executive orders on renewals
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's basically what he can do right now
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
how is this different than what you can
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
the trunk cases will do so much that's
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
it also gives us specific authority to
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
invalidate an executive order without
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
pending the state
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
which is something that we were very
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
concerned with last year
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
if the legislature could was possible
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
for them to meet it required an
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote to extend the state of
 
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote to extend the state of
emergency

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
there wasn't provision if it could be
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
not having that in there i'm
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
very concerned about it because there's
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
a difference between
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
us having to take some action to
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
extend the state of emergency or to go
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature has
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to stop it but is it too
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional for the legislature to
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
have the ability to give permission for
 
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.150 align:start position:0%
have the ability to give permission for
it

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
i mean that's a discussion i understand
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
state of emergency the governor has the
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
power to grant
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you oh i was
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if i could ask about
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
section five um bringing legislators
 
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.070 align:start position:0%
section five um bringing legislators
into

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
into concord uh you know for the
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know the conversation voting
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be around the state of
 
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be around the state of
emergency

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
do we want to build into there the
 
00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
do we want to build into there the
possibility

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
that we might need to do this remotely
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
no that's uh that's section four
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
section four sorry number five quick
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
i was on the right page and looking at
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
it but do you want to
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
consider that there for the safety of
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
all involvement there may be a time
 
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:07.110 align:start position:0%
all involvement there may be a time
where

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
we cannot physically get in and i don't
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
think we should put
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
people at risk on the road including
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
highway workers
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
other public safety workers well we
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
could do this remotely is there
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
um well starting with that section in
 
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.149 align:start position:0%
um well starting with that section in
general

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
the intent of the section was not i mean
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
because this is already in the
 
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.190 align:start position:0%
because this is already in the
constitution

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
that we can't be arrested we have to
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
bail on our way to congress this already
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
exists so this just causes what's in the
 
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.909 align:start position:0%
exists so this just causes what's in the
constitution

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of this was so that
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
representatives and senators
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
could go out and see what's going on in
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
um if there's a restriction you can't
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
travel you know
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
everyone has to stay home how can we
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
represent people we can't even go out
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
and visit and see what's going on if
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's an issue that was the intent to
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
put this in there
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
so if everyone's locked into the home
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
including the people's representatives
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
how can we how can we so so this section
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
was put in there with the specific
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
intent that we would be exempt
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of being able to go out
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
and meet with and see what's going on
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
with our constituents
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
what this does is just copy what's
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
already in the constitution that says we
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't be arrested
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
we held available on our way on our way
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that would cover going
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
open to
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
well if you want to see what was in the
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
house version
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
the handiest way to do so and it says
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
on page four members of the legislature
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
exempt from any emergency orders that
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
would infringe upon their ability to
 
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
would infringe upon their ability to
travel

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
or otherwise conduct their business
 
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.509 align:start position:0%
or otherwise conduct their business
representatives

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
which is significantly different than
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
just is a question here and it deals
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
with conduct their business
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
as representatives of the people would
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
that include
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
coming to concord does that going to not
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
allow the governor to
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
close the state house and the
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislative office building
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay at least at least
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
to close it to the legislature it's
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
possible you could say members of the
 
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
possible you could say members of the
public

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
and not the legislatures but if if
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this section is for
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature to uh
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
conduct their business as
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people shouldn't
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
the people have the right
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
so it would negate any order that the
 
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.110 align:start position:0%
so it would negate any order that the
governor

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
would give for closing the state house
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
or the legislative office building that
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
you could close down every single thing
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
in this state but the one thing that
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
would stay open would be the legislature
 
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.910 align:start position:0%
would stay open would be the legislature
[Music]

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
and we would continue to do whatever
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
business that we needed to do while we
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much just a quick
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
the governor can stop the legislature
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
from meeting or is it the legislature
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
itself that
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
i believe the legislature has to stop
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
itself right so
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think any governor's order could
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
affect the legislature to separate
 
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
affect the legislature to separate
branch

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think anything in the language
 
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
i don't think anything in the language
um

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the legislature should be somewhere
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.839 --> 00:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
originally

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think that this this provision like
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's i think really needs
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes look let's
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can flesh it out a
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit what are the issues that
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
anyone sees
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
with exempting legislators incentives
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
from being
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
able to conduct business in their
 
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
able to conduct business in their
communities

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
what you have is a two-tiered system you
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
members of the public say like what we
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
went through last year
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
or the governor said look we want you to
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
stay at home
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
but we're exempting those legislators
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
they can go out and do whatever they
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think that that would cause an issue
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
with with the people
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
um you say going out and conducting
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
business well
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
what are you talking about when you're
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
talking about conducting business
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
are you talking about um meeting your
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
constituents how are you going to meet
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
your constituents if you're in lockdown
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
what are you what are you looking for
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm i'm trying to figure out
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to get to what
 
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.230 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to get to what
specifically

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
are you looking at that you feel that
 
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
are you looking at that you feel that
because

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
we were in a lockdown you could not
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
conduct your business or do anything
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
else as a representative because i would
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
argue with you there
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
that i was very very busy people were
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
calling me um we were skyping face
 
00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
calling me um we were skyping face
timing

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
i mean we use technology to stay in
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
contact with our constituents um
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't see why we even need this
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
well a couple of things um first of all
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't focus on copic 19 because this is
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
prospective this is um contemplating
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
future emergencies so
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
what i envisioned and i work with the
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
rest of
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the folks in the community as well is if
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
walk down all right you have to stay in
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
stock for whatever reason
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
if people don't have technology can't
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
reach you the phones are down
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
there's an issue in town and that they
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
need you to come see
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
so you can relate to the rest of the
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislature the store or the business
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
at the local government if the
 
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
at the local government if the
legislature

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the representatives of the people
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
can't go out and see what's going on
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
which is our job it's not a two-tiered
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
system they elected us to represent them
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
to see these things it's not like we're
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
saying legislators can go to mcdonald's
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
but you can't
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
we're out there to be able to report
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
back to the president legislature
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the governor what we're seeing and
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
represent them
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
i see a huge difference between them
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
i can i can understand where he's coming
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
from having gone down to mississippi for
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
hurricane katrina when there's
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
no form of communication cell phone
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise um
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the only way being with fema get
 
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.790 align:start position:0%
that the only way being with fema get
out

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and interacting with people because
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
there was no way to be okay
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
um it was impossible so i see kind of
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
where he's coming from on that
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
that in the spectrum every bit we have a
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
another blockbuster storm of some sort
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that knocks out everything
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
um we all know that once the power goes
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
out uh cell phones go
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
down computers go down um we can be
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
without them for quite some time
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i can kind of see where he's coming
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
in his first communications uh a few
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
years ago we had that huge ice storm
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
people came to my house if people wanted
 
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.949 align:start position:0%
people came to my house if people wanted
to

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
talk to me about something they came to
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
my house we had no
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
telephone no internet we were out for
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
almost three weeks
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
so that was one way and um
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
they would come to my house and say can
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
you come to my house i want to show you
 
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.510 align:start position:0%
you come to my house i want to show you
something

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
and i would do that so i i do think that
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
people can be very creative when it
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
staying in contact with your
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
constituents the thing that i one of the
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
things that i'm concerned about
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
is is this going to be a problem
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
for our first responders because
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're out i mean if
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's an ice storm if it's a snowstorm or
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
a hurricane
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
tornado or whatever they're out there
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
trying to help people
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden now you see all
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
these other people coming out
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on what's what's happening
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
what are we what do we need to do
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
are we going to make their jobs harder
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
by going you know by traveling and
 
00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:58.549 align:start position:0%
by going you know by traveling and
conducting

00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
conducting
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
whatever business you feel is
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate during this time
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
are we going to make it difficult for
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
them final technical point
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
that section was unchanged in both the
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
house and the senate versions
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
so i would be very hesitant to yank it
 
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.789 align:start position:0%
so i would be very hesitant to yank it
out

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
so apparently we think that it's
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
there are times when it's necessary
 
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
there are times when it's necessary
right

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
so it's just that we're working off of
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment and it's not in this
 
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
this amendment and it's not in this
amount

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm inclined to support it on that
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
ground alone unless there's a
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
particularly good reason okay it was my
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
understanding this replaced
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
everything so it's mine as well but we
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
still have to agree on that yes sir
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
i was my understanding this was a
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
replacement as well so as we're moving
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
through this i
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
was working off of that assumption you
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
know if i may number
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
two i think that that senator
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
carson is correct that we don't
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful about if as
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
representatives of the government if we
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
are making ourselves
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
present on disaster scenes um it
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
should be in coordination with local
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
emergency management or homeland
 
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
emergency management or homeland
security

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
not as i just i'm going to show up
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
for an example when i was the mayor well
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
but because it
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
creates more first it creates more of a
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
presence of the public
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you have to manage their
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
safety as well as manage the safe give
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that that should be
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
considered when i was the mayor of
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
lebanon we had a
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
we had a number of problems with
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
microbursts and rain and i remember i
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
microbursts and rain and i remember i
called

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
the fire chief and said if you'd like um
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
i i would like to come down and see
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the city but i'm not going
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
to come until you think it's safe enough
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
for me to go and i coordinated with him
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
as a local emergency manager so for the
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
safety of all
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
if we want to have that available
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
there just should be you shouldn't just
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
be able to show up you need to according
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
to somebody i think
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's like i understand and i agree
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
with you completely but i don't think we
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
should put in statute that we don't
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
trust the intelligence
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the legislators to you know
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
accessibly an emergency
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
which is what that sort of thing would
 
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
which is what that sort of thing would
be

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
i mean um
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned if the telecoms are
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
but even without that uh you might be
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
better off with
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know a large but limited number
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
of legislators
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
going out to see people or see what's
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
going on rather than having
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
a potentially larger number of people
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get the legislators home
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
child guns are down having to cover your
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
house like
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
possible in some circumstances but not
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
in others
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire with all due
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
respect i'm not saying that people don't
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
know how to act sensibly including
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
but as a as a first responder i've been
 
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
but as a as a first responder i've been
trained

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of like what the you know the
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
first thing they teach you is
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
safety of the scene and i also
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand what it's like to be managing
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
crowd control
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know and trying to take care of
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
a situation let's take care of everyone
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
else so i'm not looking to
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit that as much as have a way so
 
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
prohibit that as much as have a way so
that

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know the legislator wants to be
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
there or is going to come but there's
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
some connection
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not saying they don't know how to
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
act sensitively those respectfully those
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
are your words i'm just
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
trying to take it from my point of
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
training that i want that to be given
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
consideration of these conversations
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just inclined to put that much level
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
of detail
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
into the status it gives me addresses to
 
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
into the status it gives me addresses to
emergencies

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
that you don't know what kind of an
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
emergency it is
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
i mean if it's an ice storm you better
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
want people to be very careful about
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
traveling because it's dangerous yeah
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
if it's something like oh that's not
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
necessary you just want to control it
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
together and then coming to your house
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
depends on where your house is
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't think because i also
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
first responded training and i agree
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
having said that i don't think this
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
exempts um legislators from having to
 
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
exempts um legislators from having to
obey

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
obey
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
offloaders of people who are in charge
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
of the scene this just says that
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency order that locks down
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't lock down the legislature
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
so if eyes the legislators show up at a
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
fire and the fire exchange says hey
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're in the way you need to go and i
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
state legislature i can stay
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
i can be arrested this just says that
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not locked
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
in by the governor's emergency order
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say i'm exempted
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
from all the rest of the rules that
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
apply in laws
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
that at the scene a fire chief or a
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
police chief did you laugh in the water
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
you disobey it yourself progresses like
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
any other citizen
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
all i'm trying to do with this piece is
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
to say i don't have to stay in my house
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
i can go up and see what's going on to
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
help my constituents
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
so i can report back to the house so i
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't think this
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
creates quite the this because i
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
understand what you're you're saying
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's 30 40 let's let it show up you know
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's i mean it's a little about the
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
press there and everything
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
but i think that i don't think that this
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
does i think it just
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
lets you out of your house it doesn't
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
extend you from the rest of the walls
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does that make sense yeah
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
so if i'm the manager you are
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
you are proposing that we include that
 
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
you are proposing that we include that
language

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
that was um it was
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
that is different in this amendment but
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
was included in both members of the
 
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
was included in both members of the
house

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that since the arrested or
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
held to bail
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
part is in the constitution we don't
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
need to repeat it
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
and share that question
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
just for my identification
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
why are we automatically assuming that
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're now operating from this amendment
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
yes the reason we're doing this
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
amendment is that various members of the
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
house who are concerned about this issue
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
have been worked in the senate
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and they've talked to me and that's why
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have this which is intent
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
because the house and the senate
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
versions have
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
much the same intent but there's
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
language differences
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
so this is an attempted compromise and
 
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.390 align:start position:0%
so this is an attempted compromise and
so

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think i thought it would be easier if
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
report from this
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand we can use
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
like in this case i think both the house
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
and the senate version have better
 
00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
and the senate version have better
language

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
do you agree we should give up on the uh
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
the governor will assist the members of
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
and senate to get the uh they see the
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
anyone have issues with the
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
proportions i like the um
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's good yeah and everything
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
under this just to make sure claire is
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
when he's
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
handsy this list of expenditures over to
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
the governor to the council
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that's 91a and that's available for
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um
 
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.549 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um
[Music]

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal being smaller you know meeting
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
remote might be practical
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
we have to concede to actually prevent
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
the governor could do an emergency order
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
i suppose allowing it
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
but uh if not good thing you remotely
 
00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:19.029 align:start position:0%
but uh if not good thing you remotely
without

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
is that is that something that could be
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
covered under house rules though
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
well isn't fiscal is that a point
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
okay that's right the other thing is
 
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
okay that's right the other thing is
that

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the government couldn't authorize
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a separate branch so we'd
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
have to put it in here
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
senate forces two people i suppose you
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
can work on that the house
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
i don't see enough i don't think you
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
have a bandwidth
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to organize the
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
procedures i don't
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
think it would work well i've had
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
smaller meetings you've spent all your
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
time saying oh where's the new
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
with somebody themselves yeah
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay you wouldn't get i don't think
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's well especially you'd have to
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
allow the public well that's possible
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
and that we'll know but it adds more
 
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:30.230 align:start position:0%
and that we'll know but it adds more
people

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
in a raised hands and asking questions
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
that heats bandwidth well yeah i've seen
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
i've seen things that were
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
because one thing is people people can't
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
if there's other people talking
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking to say something get
 
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.310 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking to say something get
recognized

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
i was noticing it it also appears to be
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
i've seen my numbers that are around
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
your job may not have started yeah it
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
appears to nullify five
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah this is
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
extradited action because to me not
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily carry the same
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
immediate health safety and welfare
 
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.830 align:start position:0%
immediate health safety and welfare
let's

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
define the immediate lawyer yes oh i was
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
actually centered continue because i
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.830 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
defining emergency action
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
that i think that piece needs work
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
i agree because i think it makes uh
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
although i i can see the necessity
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
for some form of it right but um
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
something comes up
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
let's just close five days right we need
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
to we need to massage that i
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
well i think one thing is that the
 
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.909 align:start position:0%
well i think one thing is that the
um

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
there's got to be notification right
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal and the executive council
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
notified within
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
24 hours and
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
they could decide to do something
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
i think that simply a notification
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours should
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
if it's something that requires
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
expedited action from immediate health
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
right that sounds to me like something
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
no happening right now i mean i think
 
00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:11.830 align:start position:0%
no happening right now i mean i think
when

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.870 align:start position:0%
when
uh

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
in canada said you know my my my plane's
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
in canada said you know my my my plane's
leaving

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
um leaving china do you want me to
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
can you buy some more ppe to fill it up
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay that would that would be short
 
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.029 align:start position:0%
okay that would that would be short
numbers

00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
but that's the sort of thing that that i
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
think that should be notified
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
after the agreement you know at least
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:41.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:47.750 align:start position:0%

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
but i think just some sort of
 
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.710 align:start position:0%
but i think just some sort of
notification

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the senate president the speaker of
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
and and the chair of the fiscal
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee so they at least know what's
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's that's reasonable
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
because you don't
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
you don't want to try you don't want
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't want to micromanage the
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
situation because there could be a
 
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:23.710 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.829 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
i i agree with what you just said my
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
only concern is notification is great
 
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
only concern is notification is great
but

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
what is it how is it a chat
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay i deemed this to be an emergency
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
this could be a health issue this
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
notification notification notification
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a check
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
how so how would we turn it into please
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're letting the legislative body know
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
what the governor whoever the governor
 
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
what the governor whoever the governor
is

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
is doing that is the check and then
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
once the senate president the speaker of
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
they know what's going on if they choose
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
an alternative action they have the
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
ability to do that
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
right now they don't have the ability to
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
do that they would find out
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much what everybody else would
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
find out here
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you would say within 24 hours you've
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
got to
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
notify the senate president the speaker
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the house the chair of the fiscal
 
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
of the house the chair of the fiscal
committee

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
what you're doing that's the check
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
because then it becomes
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
more transparent right now there really
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of transparency and
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
they and they can in fact
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
call a session cancel if next
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's so that that's not right i
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
think that's the truth
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my question goes to
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
under this provision the governor spends
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
say it was on a saturday or sunday for
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
playing over
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
bringing ppe back for that purpose
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
how does the house and the senate
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
how does the house and the senate
rescind

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
rescind
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
that appropriation because that's when
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're allowing us to do that
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
i think what we really want is what we
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
have is the transparency on how the
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
appropriations are
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't think the 24-hour notice is
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
necessary because right below we
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
say within 30 days all expenditures have
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be reported to the council
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why notifying the senate
 
00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why notifying the senate
president

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house within 24 hours
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
when i don't think they could stop that
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
um would be any different than what we
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
with 38 notifications so i think we're
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
checking the check
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
right below a couple thoughts on that
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
know if if fiscal or whatever else
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
really disapproved of what was going on
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
at least they have earlier notification
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
and could take action to prevent any
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
further similar expenditures it's not
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
perfect but there is a problem that you
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
could have legitimate issues with
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done right now
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
but if they've got notification 24 hours
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know they could say well we're going
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
to get together you know
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
avoid that emergency order that you did
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
or something else and there'd be some
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
discussion going on
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
so if you had somebody that the
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislature would help you is going a
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
little rogue
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
they put interviewing earlier so i think
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's the other question on the
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
notification should the executive
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
emergency

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
there are so many scenarios where you
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
could have to expend funds
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
state under a circumstance
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
you could you could scratch the other
 
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
you could you could scratch the other
circumstances

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
i just remember years ago when um
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
governor lynch was governor and i think
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
bob you were in the house as well
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
um with the fall with the floods in
 
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
um with the fall with the floods in
austin

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
austin
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
and um the governor had declared a state
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
of emergency but
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
we had a special session if you remember
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
he brought the legislature in to expend
 
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.190 align:start position:0%
he brought the legislature in to expend
money

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
to uh to provide relief so
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
it does happen i mean there is a
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
procedure i just
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
i'm just really concerned about
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
micromanaging this process
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
that you know why we think we're trying
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
to create a balance we're really not
 
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
and we're tying the hand of the governor
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
whoever the governor
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
will be to act accordingly
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
in a time of a state of emergency
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i think the governor needs to have
 
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
and i think the governor needs to have
some

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility in order to deal with the
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
different types
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
of problems that we could
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
face and i just think we just need to be
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
really careful about tying the hands
 
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.750 align:start position:0%
really careful about tying the hands

chris
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
we're just limiting to a declared state
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay because he's got to notify ahead of
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
time because we as fiscal have five days
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
to get back
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty good adult suspension
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
to hand it off i was just going to say i
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
add in the language regarding a state of
 
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
add in the language regarding a state of
emergency

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
into that paragraph because it's already
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
under the powers emergency powers of the
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay i think you're being redundant if
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
you put state of emergency back in there
 
00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
you put state of emergency back in there
because

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
you're right 445 is all about
 
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
you're right 445 is all about

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
you'll have to have legislation in order
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%

language first
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
and then you can you can add this as a
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
separate section to that
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
bill but if you put it in here and if
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
something happens to the legislation all
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you've got this and what do

um
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
can we just say if appropriate

what the need to be able to happen

the provision the right to know uh you
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
could write it there's
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
something that says the provision of the

right to know while it requires a forum
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
to be present
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
in a place does not apply to any

back to this

members of the legislature shall be
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
exempt from emergency orders
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that would infringe upon their ability
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%

representatives of the people
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
um because i
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's very clear
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know they could own a business i'm
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
just going to use the word a bar
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that's how they meet constituents by
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
opening their business and people come
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
to the bar and they get to talk to them
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's counter to what what
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
what you really want to do is there a
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
way that we could strengthen that and do
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
have to travel can it just be
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
would infringe upon their ability to
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
conduct their business as

i i just i know that we had agreed to

i i just i know that we had agreed to
that

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's i understand that you want to stay
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
in contact with your constituents i
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
think that that's important
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
um but i don't want to set us above
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
an emergency order an emergency
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
order is for everyone and it's for
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
everyone's health safety and welfare and
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
i would submit sharon
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
that i have many constituents that would
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
expect me
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
to visit to visit their homework
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the situation where just collapsed
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
not in any way to interfere with
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
and so my perspective is that's almost
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
an expectation
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
they like to seek me out helping
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
engage myself in the process of solving
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative perspective not from
 
00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
the legislative perspective not from
operation

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
and if i may to your powerpoint it
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't exempt
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
anyone but the legislators so people
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
can't come to your borrower to meet you
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
because they'd be violating the
 
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.349 align:start position:0%
because they'd be violating the
trafficker

00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
to go see whoever needs to be seen
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure the other thing is
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
that this past year we had the americans
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
that said every once they don't accept
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
essential workers
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
i mean we couldn't just declare
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
legislators essential workers
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
well why don't we do that because who
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
knows what the
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
language of the next emergency order
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
would be but
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
in this case there was we had a two-tier
 
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
in this case there was we had a two-tier
system

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know potential workers and everybody
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
else right so
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
this would simply say that legislators
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
are by definition essential workers
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
if a future governor chooses to oppose a
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know that would infringe on their
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct their business as
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
representatives for people
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
sound strong enough to meet but i'm not
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
sure what was in the board
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
well if we take the travel out then and
 
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.090 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:17.109 align:start position:0%

those three words
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
even the ability to promote
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to put
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
something into that section that
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
um there are penalties if someone
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think that doesn't doesn't
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay they could be subject to um
 
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.470 align:start position:0%
okay they could be subject to um

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know go to the complaints can be
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
made to the legislative
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
ethics committee or they could be
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
subject to censure
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know if that needed to be
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
spelled out i'm just really concerned
 
00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:22.470 align:start position:0%
spelled out i'm just really concerned
about

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
people taking in legislative state
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
abusing this
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm using this statue
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
so the other deterrent is
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
if something lipstick does it
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
that it can be made publicly
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
really you know the ends and
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
limits that disciplines legislators
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
voters yeah can we say that
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
why is
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
does not include the ability to conduct
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
does not include the ability to conduct
business

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
as a legislator that was your personal
 
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
as a legislator that was your personal
business

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
just to make it a little clearer
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
well i think it's pretty clear conduct
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
their business as representatives of the
 
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
their business as representatives of the
people

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay that's i think that's pretty clear
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
very quickly i try not to get frustrated
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
but the point of this
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in this very meeting is to
 
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
legislation in this very meeting is to
discuss

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
and bring in a future governor's
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
ability to do things without checking
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
with the legislature and now we're
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for legislators i
 
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.430 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for legislators i
think

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
when i met the governor last week he was
 
00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:10.549 align:start position:0%
when i met the governor last week he was
concerned

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
that the language of
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
one version i'm not sure which foreign
 
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.829 align:start position:0%
one version i'm not sure which foreign
legislature

00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
met and did not take up
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency that it would be
 
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.270 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency that it would be
cancelled

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
cancelled
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
by inaction i don't i don't think that's
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
um but allowing the state of emergency
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
will be extended
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
without the affirmative approval of the
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature i
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's the whole foundation the
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that's less of a time critical thing
 
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.549 align:start position:0%
and that's less of a time critical thing
because

00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know we know when it's going to
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
the personal house version there was a
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
provision if the house truly could not
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
be that the government
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
even this past year if
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
i think that that after the first
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
renewal we should be improving your
 
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.630 align:start position:0%
renewal we should be improving your
goals

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
goals
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
and even this past year we could have
 
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
and even this past year we could have
met

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's about 45 or 50 days after the
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
initial declaration
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we did in fact and we did in fact
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
take up the
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
end of the emergency but failed so i
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
the concern is that the reason
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
legislature has
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to limit the executive
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
authority of government i think the
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
in an emergency right so let's define
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
the period of time
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's important part of the argument
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
for changing the 21 and 30 days of the
 
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.589 align:start position:0%
for changing the 21 and 30 days of the
house

00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
was it was tied to that requirement that
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
we had with
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
extended and we wanted to provide a long
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
enough period that it covered
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know all the normal emergencies
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
which are mainly weather related
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want a situation where you
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
know there's some weather like you know
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
it can dry storm that
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
lasted longer than a few weeks 22 days
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
right right that you know there wouldn't
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
extended emergencies
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all the state of
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
emergencies other than you know code
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to think of other things
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
that could be a longer state of
 
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
that could be a longer state of
emergency

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know they've seen more of a lot of
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
something but
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
short of that um this wouldn't go into
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
effect but the concern is if you have a
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
government that
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
right here wrongly decides to have a
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
really long-term state of
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
emergency this guy the legislature's got
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be a check and it's very different
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
having a requirement that we have to
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
vote to approve an extension that is
 
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
vote to approve an extension that is
stopping

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
stopping
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
right and one's much more powerful
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
so what negative 60 days
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
the process of getting things going with
 
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
the process of getting things going with
emergency

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah i mean i would be willing to
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
extend it to 60 days
 
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's wisely so it would have caused beth
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
if we just said okay we end the
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
statement because
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
he was to use a phrase it's too big and
 
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:58.549 align:start position:0%
he was to use a phrase it's too big and
fair

00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's tied into everything it's going to
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
finance this time the business is
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
turning into public safety
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
so the longer you let it go on let's
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
check the more difficult
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
it will be to stop it
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
so it's 60 days too much or is it just
 
00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:29.030 align:start position:0%
so it's 60 days too much or is it just
right

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
open i'm just trying to yeah flesh it
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
out so
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
i just i'm gonna dial back to very
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
basic questions why do we want
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
to why do we want to stop it why do we
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
want someone we want to say
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
this what is the legislature want to
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
manage a state of emergency at a level
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
where they're saying
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to stop this or we're going
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
to continue this
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know if we have checks and balances
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
in places it has to do with money and we
 
00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:58.470 align:start position:0%
in places it has to do with money and we
trust

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
our chief executive that's i've always
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
struggled with this i'm not
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
being difficult or obstructionary but
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
why we're saying we have to get in on
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
that granular level and say no
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
i i do think that this is i think the
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
compromise that the senate came up with
 
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.150 align:start position:0%
compromise that the senate came up with
because

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
i can remember talking about this during
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
our first
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
beating on it and i i pushed back in the
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
same vein so i'm just going to
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
push back then i think we've come really
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
far i appreciate the work that senator
 
00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:27.270 align:start position:0%
far i appreciate the work that senator
veda

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
veda
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
and folks have done but why are we
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
getting like i think we've put some good
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
guard bureaus in place
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do and why when why
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
this is just i'm just asking and i'm not
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
being difficult
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
um i don't like to look at it as
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
we the legislature saying we don't
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
trust the executive or we need to get
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
into the business
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
executive but after a certain period of
 
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.750 align:start position:0%
executive but after a certain period of
time

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's not us it's the citizen i trust the
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
citizens of an answer more than my
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
choice to go
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
if they decide in whole through their
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
representatives and senate house
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
we've had enough of this that's how
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
democracy works
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
that they don't but when you leave it up
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
to one person to say we're going to do
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
this at
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
infinity and you guys just sit there and
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
be quiet that's where all this
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
frustration came from
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think the voice is there looking at
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
this because you can with the
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
resolution you can end it so it still is
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
there if
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
the people choose but it's like
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
flipping the coin 50 one way 50 to the
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
other see the legislature ends it more
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
but the 20 is going to be much more
 
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
but the 20 is going to be much more
difficult

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
once it's already placed and it becomes
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know such a huge entity that you end
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
the event with people because
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
systems have been put in place you just
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
pull that rug up underneath them
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
for example having ended it you'd have
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
lost all this business ppe money all
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
this stuff that already been put in
 
00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.829 align:start position:0%
this stuff that already been put in
place

00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
versus had we approved it in the first
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
place i think there's a difference
 
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.309 align:start position:0%
place i think there's a difference
between

00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
ending and approving to go forward
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
another point is that
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
the supporters
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
after the first couple started
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
delving into policy issues and that's
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature hasn't
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility for us
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
what's an essential business but you
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
know this
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
the lesson the license and things you
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
know we
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
when we reviewed the executive orders we
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
decided to incorporate some of them into
 
00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:42.549 align:start position:0%
decided to incorporate some of them into
statute

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
we've approved them there were others
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
that we said well
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
we don't really think this was that good
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
an idea but then
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
we won't let it happen again so if we
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
had been able to review some of the
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
policy choices
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
the decision to shut down non-essential
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
businesses by
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
listing them was something that was a
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
major policy choice that a lot of people
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
and i will say that's probably one of
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
the main reasons why i
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
agreed with your version at the
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislation needs to be because of
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going to come in to okay the
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
emergency orders which i think we
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
should have a saying when it deals with
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
policy then we can at the same time deal
 
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.030 align:start position:0%
policy then we can at the same time deal
with

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
the extension of the state of emergency
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why that his
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
position versus the other because of the
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
emergency laws and
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
being put on policy which is
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so a couple
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
things one is i felt that uh because we
 
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
things one is i felt that uh because we
didn't

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
we're in a position to approve the
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
extension that
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature was advocating it's it's
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for the people and i got
 
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.150 align:start position:0%
responsible for the people and i got
that

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
i was contacted by a number of
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
constituents and other people
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
that weren't happy with what's going on
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i think some of them would have been
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
happy if at least the legislature got
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
together and said yes we need to
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
continue this
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i see value in that and the other
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
thing is i'm willing to go along with
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
removing the language that's what we can
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
individual executive orders just like
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
the language in there
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
that we can get rid of them
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
if if we have to get together at least
 
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.789 align:start position:0%
if if we have to get together at least
approve

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
extension um because it's
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's easy i think to
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to stand back and
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
just not get involved and i think that's
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
what happened here
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
i think forcing the election we're gonna
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we may mostly agree
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the emergency work the emergency
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
emergency has to continue
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
but you know forcing the legislature to
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
get together and improve it i think is
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know if nothing else we're putting
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
our stamp of approval on it supporting
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know if we think that's the right
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
thing to do and also that would force us
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
to get together
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it would be the opportunity that
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
least kind of set up an opportunity to
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
review individuals that have most
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
so i think having us having to act to
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
extend it is
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:55.170 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.170 --> 01:03:00.829 align:start position:0%

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
on line 19 where it says unless it is

reviewed
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
by a majority vote of each chamber of
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature prior to termination
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the event the legislature is unable
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
to convene
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency shall and

emergency orders shall
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
automatically extend in 14-day
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
increments or until the legislature can
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
convene to vote on the renewal whichever
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
comes first
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the governor has the power to have
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see a legislature being
 
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.309 align:start position:0%
i don't see a legislature being
frivolous

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
or political if you're in a state of
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
emergency that's some serious business
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not naive enough to think that there
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
won't be politics played
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
but i would have to hope that a majority
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
of your citizens would say you know what
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
we support this and help you also help
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
us get out there now
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
there may be circumstances that citizens
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
are not aware of
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
the things that they're not aware of
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
that the government is
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
also and so in that sense we can
 
01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
also and so in that sense we can
hopefully

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that was really one of my points in
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
drafting this was that
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's made a lot of decisions
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to criticize him because
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what he knows i mean he had
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
some real experts testified to him
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
that said you know what this decision
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
that's the right decision
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't so all we knew was that order
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
happened our constituents say hey why
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
did you do that
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know so but it's the same
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
presentation has to be made to the house
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
to extend the order
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
and now we all know we can all tell our
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
we have done this last year we did meet
 
01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.309 align:start position:0%
we have done this last year we did meet
probably

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
so let's take this to an extreme let's
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
take a situation with the governor
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
no but i think the federal authorities
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
would take precedent they would take
 
01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:04.789 align:start position:0%
would take precedent they would take
over

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
information if you're talking about a
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
nuclear biological weapon you're going
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
to tell them security is going to be in
 
01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:11.029 align:start position:0%
to tell them security is going to be in
it's

01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
well no because this is a national
 
01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.549 align:start position:0%
well no because this is a national
threat

01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
threat
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start limiting it
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and say we have to improve and we're
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature's meetings been opened
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's a threat to the state i think that
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
was recently
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
discussing the strategy of being
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
involved in war states in the world war
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
but i think we're applying terrorism
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's an exception
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the constitution on public access
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
no i'm not the state there's an
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
exemption in 91a for
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think we've sort of agreed on the
 
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.910 align:start position:0%
i think we've sort of agreed on the
intent

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
and where would we work it so we working
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
from this
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
draft draft amendment
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
we created the first paragraph
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
on line 17 we would extend the statement
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
to 45 days to
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
simplify things yeah on the next part a
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
we would make it for 45 days under the
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
house version
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to approve a renewal beyond
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
45 days
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
but if we can't make them
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
14 weeks extensions as necessary and
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the emergency orders go we
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
agree that we
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
can terminate them individually oh yes
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
but we do not get involved in that
 
01:08:36.839 --> 01:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
but we do not get involved in that
that's

01:08:42.639 --> 01:08:42.649 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
we would change that we don't terminate
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
a state from moving
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
we may terminate any emergency order
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
well it's still a state of emergency
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
though right yeah what we just
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
we just turn it into words right we
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
approve the state of the number
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
they continue to state an emergency and
 
01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:16.149 align:start position:0%
they continue to state an emergency and
we

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
but we can't terminate the state
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
emergency itself except for by not
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
voting to extend no no
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
no not true okay yeah you're right we
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to do it
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um i think we need to make it
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
it should be an up or down motion that
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be able to table these
 
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be able to table these
things

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
if i mean if this is about
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm like we need to make sure
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that there is a a majority vote and it's
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
not the table
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
agreed about the tables
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
well no but does the senator mean
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
present in voting
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
versus in other words if so many people
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't show up
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
should it be just a majority of the
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
members president voted yes
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
for those of you that haven't met my
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
name is james kelly i'm the governor's
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
legal counsel and the naval academy
 
01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:04.229 align:start position:0%
legal counsel and the naval academy
graduates

01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think one of the concerns with the
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
language as presented is it
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
allows one chamber to tell the state of
 
01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:11.189 align:start position:0%
allows one chamber to tell the state of
emergency

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
um if one chamber were to table
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
it in other words to terminate that
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
folks state emergency would that field
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
you can't guarantee that both chambers
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
will agree what happens if one chamber
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
votes to continue and one of us
 
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
votes to continue and one of us
determines

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
determines
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
to continue the motion has to be
 
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.910 align:start position:0%
to continue the motion has to be
determined

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
letting the governor create a state of
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency remain in a state of emergency
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
is an extraordinary situation grants
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary powers the legislature is
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
to some extent stepping aside
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
i might keep letting him run things
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
which in any real emergency might be
 
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.070 align:start position:0%
which in any real emergency might be
necessary

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the question is if we have a
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
right there's a lot of dynamics that the
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislature have
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
to prove and one is as has been
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned the governor is going to
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know probably need to provide the
 
01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
you know probably need to provide the
legislative

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.470 align:start position:0%
legislative
information

01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
and there might also be you know some
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
amount of negotiating
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
about what happens in controversial
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
disorders and other things which i think
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
admissible interaction and we're talking
 
01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.070 align:start position:0%
admissible interaction and we're talking
about

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
giving them basically a free range of 45
 
01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.430 align:start position:0%
giving them basically a free range of 45
days

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire so just
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
for clarification
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um representative leakes largest
 
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.630 align:start position:0%
um representative leakes largest
blackouts

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
blackouts
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
roy and lovely is easy but i know it's a
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
problem that's all right i'll get there
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
so what you correct me if i'm wrong what
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying is
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
that if we if we or you don't think it's
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
then we could say no we don't think it's
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
an emergency and tell the governor
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
like we don't think this is any work to
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
see our judgment is
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
it isn't so we're going to stop this
 
01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.830 align:start position:0%
it isn't so we're going to stop this
right

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay what again why why would
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
what do you have any examples if we're
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
like how would you determine
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
or how would we determine what's an
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
emergency or not what puts us in that
 
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.709 align:start position:0%
emergency or not what puts us in that
position

01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's our jobs make decisions
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
the governor if if there's any concern
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
about it being a real emergency
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
i would expect the governor to be out
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
there telling us why it's a real
 
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.149 align:start position:0%
there telling us why it's a real
emergency

01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
because i mean this one like i said if
 
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
because i mean this one like i said if
we

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
voted in in april for may we would have
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
said yes it's an emergency we
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
will continue we'll be authorized but by
 
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.390 align:start position:0%
will continue we'll be authorized but by
august

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
august
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people saying it's
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
not an emergency anymore it's a
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
public health issue that we need to deal
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
with but it's not an
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
emergency and so at that point you've
 
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.510 align:start position:0%
emergency and so at that point you've
got

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
a difference of opinion on
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
whether it should be continued but it
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't at the beginning because
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
the general senator raises another
 
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
the general senator raises another
concern

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a federal requirement for it
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
to be a declared state of emergency do
 
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
to be a declared state of emergency do
we

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
have a different or separate type of
 
01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:08.709 align:start position:0%
have a different or separate type of
statement

01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know i understand why we want to do
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
this but i mean
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
i it's a delicate balance here um
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you know i i
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
i see where there's some micromanaging
 
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
i see where there's some micromanaging
that

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we shouldn't be doing um
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
we've got to trust whoever the governor
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that they're doing the right thing
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and granted there should be some things
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
that we can do on the other side
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't be tying the hands of
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
there he's going to get information much
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
faster than
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature is going to get and if
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
he has to declare
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency or start issuing
 
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency or start issuing
emergency

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
orders the governor whoever he or she
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be should be able to do that
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
we should be able to chime in also and
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
really for me the question is
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
how does the legislature chime in we
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to impede
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the governor is doing because
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
just as we are all elected officials the
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
governor is an elected official also
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the governor is going to have to
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
answer to the people for the things
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
that he or she does or does not do
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
but should we be standing in the way
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
and i think with like a lot of new
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of frustration over how
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
long colvin went
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
that maybe it went it went on too long
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i would agree that you know in
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
august of last year we're like yeah hey
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know why are we still doing this and
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's because the governor
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
had information that we were going to
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
get that second wind and we started to
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
hear about that
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
second wind that was coming and it came
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
it came and that's why the emergency
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
orders were continued
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
um in fact i think that the the second
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
wave of coven
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
was worse than the first we experienced
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
more deaths more sicknesses than we did
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
during the first time so
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes i know representative rory talked
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
about you know
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
not so much about hindsight and coving
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
but moving forward
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's important that we
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
look back at the experience
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and what what was the role that the
 
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
um and what what was the role that the
legislature

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
could have played and i agree that at
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
some point the legislator
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislature should have been involved
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
especially with
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders and the policy
 
01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders and the policy
issues

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe people would have felt a
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
little more comfortable
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
with knowing that the legislature was
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
actively involved
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
in these policy issues representative
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
representatives senator gaida
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i sat on the governor's task force
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
and that was pretty intensive in the
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
very beginning
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
where we were working hand-in-hand with
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
businesses and industries
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
about what we could open how we were
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
going to open them and open them safely
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
for the people and you know again
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of work we were meeting
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
five days a week for
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
for real yeah for at least three months
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then we continued to meet
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
um on a regular schedule to discuss
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
as things got better those those
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
emergency orders those those other
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
things were loosened
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
up um and i think that it was the right
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
thing to do because it was a
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
very very delicate balance and i
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
understand there were a lot of people
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
who were very angry
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we know a lot of people lost their
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
businesses and so on and so forth
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that's not trivializing anything
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
but it was what we found ourselves into
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it was dictated by the
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
federal government in the cdc
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
i hope we never ever have to go through
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that again
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i've actively encouraged the
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
governor to put together a task force
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
where we can take a look at what we did
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
right what we did wrong and what we need
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
to improve on
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i see this as part of that is what
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
really is the legislature's role
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
when we have states of emergency and we
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
need to issue
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
executive orders but how deeply do you
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
micromanage this how how hard do you
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
want to tie the governor's hands that's
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i understand the micromanagement
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's why i think the change to
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
the house bill to remove the requirement
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we have to approve
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
individual emergency orders because
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know that lets the governor respond
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the timely manner
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
having to approve the extension of the
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
emergency state of emergency
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
especially after 45 days is
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's not i don't see that as
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
management because that's
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
we see that coming ahead the governor
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
will have time to get information to us
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
um you know who can consider that
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's more of a let's see kind
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
longer term policy thing it's not
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with not limiting immediate
 
01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
dealing with not limiting immediate
responses

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
responses
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is you know let's say
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
in august the legislature decided to
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
have a state of emergency
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know even in face of the governor's
 
01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:27.510 align:start position:0%
you know even in face of the governor's
recommendation

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
to that it did look like there was a
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
surge actually coming i don't see the
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
at that point sometime later and then as
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
far as the
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
issue of getting the federal money i've
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
seen arguments on both sides saying we
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
could have got it without a state state
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
of emergency because the federal one
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
but regardless of that you know the
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
governor could if that's the case the
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
governor could let the legislature know
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
and say okay we need the state of
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
emergency for this reason
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um but you know i'm going to limit you
 
01:20:59.280 --> 01:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
um but you know i'm going to limit you
know

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
remove most of the emergency orders that
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe aren't necessary
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
continuous state of emergency but with
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
dramatically less restrictions
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
largely or maybe not terrible largely so
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
we can get that money
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent that from
 
01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.709 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent that from
discussion

01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know the legislature would have
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
developed so i think i think it leads to
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of flexibility and gives us some
 
01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
a lot of flexibility and gives us some
flexibility

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in here that would
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
limit the legislature
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
from calling a special session to
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
discuss any sort of policies
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
policy emergency orders that any
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
governor would institute
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a strong tool that
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature does have
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
to keep a check on the governor and
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
whatever policy changes the governor
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
makes either
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
to say yes we just we agree or no we
 
01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.030 align:start position:0%
to say yes we just we agree or no we
disagree

01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
so um i don't think we need to put that
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill but for discussion purposes
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
we're already able to do something
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
i mean last year while we were in
 
01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
i mean last year while we were in
lockdown

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
lockdown
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it was march and it was april and i
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
know i was sitting there going okay what
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
are we going to do now
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the legislature could have been
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
um the legislature could have been
called

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
called in at any point in time and we
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
could have met we could have met and we
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
could have discussed
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
the policy changes the appropriate
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee chairs could have gotten
 
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
committee chairs could have gotten
together

01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
but the governor still would have signed
 
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
but the governor still would have signed
right

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
but then again that's holding the
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
governor accountable
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
because if the governor said i don't
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
like this and i'm not going to sign it
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
the people are going to hold you
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for that aren't they
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
they are but in the two years until the
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
next election we've lost businesses
 
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
next election we've lost businesses
we've

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
lost all kinds of things which is why he
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
gets 45 days on this proposal
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
unrestricted to do what he needs to do
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
if it's longer than 45 days he still
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
gets to
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
we just have to extend the emergency
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
we're not micromanaging we're not saying
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
you can't do this you can't do that if
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
he doesn't order we don't like
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
we can receive the order but before
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
anything beyond 45 days is a long period
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't take that long for a
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
business to fold and if you're saying
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
he's accountable
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the elector absolutely he is in two
 
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
to the elector absolutely he is in two
years

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
so i mean we were into a year and a half
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
of an emergency order when we started
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
we heard that there were almost no
 
01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:32.709 align:start position:0%
we heard that there were almost no
emergencies

01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
states of virginia there was i think the
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
all-state flood was extended once
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
to wrap up the repairs but most of them
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
were 21 days an hour so
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
if that 45 days that will take care of
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
almost anything the definition of
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
emergence means
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
disruption once that has happened now
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
you start instituting policies and
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
a public health emergency is no less of
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
an emergency and this is
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
that these are extraordinary
 
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.030 align:start position:0%
that these are extraordinary
circumstances

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we will never be here
 
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we will never be here
again

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
but in order you know so i think there
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
there had to be actions taken and they
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
were certainly detrimental to some of
 
01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
were certainly detrimental to some of
the

01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
businesses and constituents in my
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
district as well
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
but the conversation was about the
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
greater good you couldn't see this
 
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
greater good you couldn't see this
emergency

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
like a tornado or a flood but this is
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what we've been preparing for
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire since
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
after hurricane katrina
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
and 9 11. so it's it's no less of an
 
01:24:46.719 --> 01:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
and 9 11. so it's it's no less of an
emergency

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's just so extraordinary so what
 
01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
it's just so extraordinary so what
lessons

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
have we learned that we can maybe not i
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know what lessons have we learned
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
and how should we respond in the future
 
01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
and how should we respond in the future
keeping

01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
keeping that in mind i'm you know
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i wonder if we're missing the
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really look at that
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
by you know can we do something very
 
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.189 align:start position:0%
by you know can we do something very
very

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
minimal and at the same time
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
have a commission or a study group that
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
really looks at the impacts
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
all around to make union c's do we need
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have something larger
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
put in place but that's what this bill
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
is intended to be
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
is the fairly minimal changes we have
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
because yeah this is this is an outline
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it addresses what we saw were the
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
biggest issues
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
namely that it could be continued
 
01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
namely that it could be continued
forever

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
and ever and ever we thought was a
 
01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
and ever and ever we thought was a
concern

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's also the point that some of the
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
emergency orders
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
engaged on policy and should have been
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
approved and so we wanted to be able to
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
even if
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency continued we
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to say
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the governor cancel this emergency
 
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
to the governor cancel this emergency
order

01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing the policy decision and not
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
telling you what to do to say don't do
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
it this way
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest issues that we
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
discussed that
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
i got from my constituency what made you
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
draft this is communication
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
even on the committee that you were on
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
you were trimming certain things in the
 
01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
you were trimming certain things in the
governor

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
prior to certain things but as a
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislative told
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
we found out about american orders
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
saying everyone else
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
so when my phone rings and says why does
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
the government do this
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i wasn't part of that
 
01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i wasn't part of that
discussion

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:46.250 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
so there was a distinct lack of
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
communication now
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
because i want to support god he's my
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
governor i want us towards policies but
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
i can't afford hawaii
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
the communication is very important i
 
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:00.190 align:start position:0%
the communication is very important i
think

01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
