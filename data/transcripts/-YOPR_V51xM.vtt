00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 align:start position:0%
two o'clock I will open the subcommittee
 
00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call this a work session on
 
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 421
 
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
House Bill 421
and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
at this time we will recognize the
 
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill representative Reed
 
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
you wanna
 
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
so so basically our recap of this is
 
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we heard some testimony
 
00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
and from you know from that the bill was
 
00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
written pretty short and sweet
 
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
but as we went through the testimony we
 
00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
kind of went down a rabbit hole
 
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
and now we are kind of here to address
 
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
that to see if we can get the
 
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
legislation written so that everything
 
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
that we heard in testimony will be put
 
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 align:start position:0%
into this
and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
so I believe that's where we're probably
 
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
the best place to pick it up from thank
 
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so the the main two issues that were
 
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
brought up I believe all of the
 
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
testimony was in favor of the bill and
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
certainly all the comments from the
 
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee was in favor of the premise of
 
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
the bill the two issues that got brought
 
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
up is a little bit of
 
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
um ambiguity around the type of product
 
00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
and some of the kind of more new age
 
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
products could like divacup could
 
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
propose a security risk so we wanted to
 
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
allow incarcerated people to choose the
 
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
product that they wanted that suited
 
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
their needs but still be able to allow
 
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
for that security the language and this
 
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
language was vetted and approved by
 
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
um the actually I think the commissioner
 
00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
herself suggested this language and it's
 
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just start reading the
 
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent of each County
 
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility it's also says it
 
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
for the state shall provide menstrual
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
hygiene products to all people who
 
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
menstruate in the custody of the county
 
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
and adequate amounts as necessary at no
 
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
cost to such person the incarcerated
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
person shall be provided a choice of
 
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products to include at
 
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
a minimum pads tampons and panty liners
 
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
of varying strengths necessary for their
 
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
menstrual needs the number and type of
 
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
menstrual hygiene products kept in
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated person cell shall not be
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
excessive so as to create a safety or
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
security issue and shall be used only
 
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
for the intended purpose
 
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
in this section menstrual hygiene
 
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
product and it defines what that means
 
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's any product designed to address
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
menstruation excuse me representative is
 
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
that an amendment that you have yes and
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
I sent it to you but I was just emailing
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the subcommittee members
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
when you called me up so
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
um and then the other issue that let me
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
see if I can get that printed for us oh
 
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely if do we have a yeah Brad if
 
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
I forward that to you are you able to
 
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
print that for us
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's zero one three three h
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
I think this might make it easier for
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
all if we can read it let it happen you
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to sit there and read it and I I
 
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
will say that the other issue that was
 
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
brought up was the idea because we had
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
numerous people testifying that there
 
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
had been examples of people who had
 
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
gotten infections specifically from
 
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
panties that were provided to them the
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
state does always provide new pansies
 
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
but the counties do not so uh what we
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
did to address that again had the
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners okay
 
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
any items provided by the county to
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerated persons that are impacted
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
by menstruation shall be provided in an
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
adequate number and and this is
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
sanitized but it was proposed to say new
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
shall be provided new
 
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
um so I might be looking at the actual
 
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
wrong version of the amendment but I can
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
certainly get that fixed
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
before being provided to another
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
all right so that was that was sent to
 
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
Brad and he's going to hook us up with
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
um so those were the two issues that
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
were brought up and as far as I know all
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders including the county I
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me the State Department of
 
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
Corrections commissioner uh Haynes
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
um are all in support of these
 
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
particular uh Corrections
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you representative so
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep this very very
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
informal so we can you know all be
 
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
together here would you ladies like to
 
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
are you guys okay if we just have like a
 
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
are you guys okay if we just have like a
conversation

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the questions that I that
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
I have that I just want to make sure is
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
so wear it on the amendment that she
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
just read which again is coming into us
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
where it said about the supplies being
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
kept kept with the person
 
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
and it said you know however much was
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be there I is is there
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
wording there that we have to put
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
for you guys so and I guess my my exact
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
question is what is
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
is it a discretionary where it says the
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
amount like who decides what is
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.090 align:start position:0%
 
pastor

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
so if if I may so uh the reason
 
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 align:start position:0%
at a time the goal of course is to make
 
00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:46.670 align:start position:0%
at a time the goal of course is to make
short

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
yeah the goal of course is to make sure
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
that the incarcerated may I have one of
 
00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.689 align:start position:0%
that the incarcerated may I have one of
those

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
make sure that the incarcerated person's
 
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
menstrual needs are met and their
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
sanitation needs are met so we didn't
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
want to give an exact number I
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand there's a Senate bill that
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
does raise what the practice is on the
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
state level which is 15 as was cited and
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
raises that to a mandatory 20 at minimum
 
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
I did not feel that giving a specific
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
number was advisable because if the
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
incarcerated person actually doesn't
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
need 20 that kind of becomes an unfunded
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
mandate uh which I understand there was
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
some question around that but since
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
there is as I said in Committee in the
 
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
hearing since there is already
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
understood to be a constitutional
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
requirement to take care of the basic
 
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
health and sanitation needs of
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
all-incarcerated persons I don't believe
 
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 align:start position:0%
that specifying that that includes
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
menstruation needs goes beyond what's
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
already required of the state and of
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
counties that we're simply clarifying
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
that actually this is part of that basic
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
need need but if you were to say 20 and
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone didn't need 20 then that would
 
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
the re
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
I want to I I feel like I need to make a
 
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
disclosure here
 
00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:08.749 align:start position:0%
disclosure here
disclaimer

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
disclaimer
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
I was on committee with some people that
 
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.170 align:start position:0%
I was on committee with some people that
could

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
pick a bone dry
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to foresee that sure
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
so do you think in your opinion and and
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
are our fellow friends here do we have
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
to say specifically so where you have
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
you know okay of their choice we have
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
that in there right
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
um do we need to have the wording not
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily A A brand
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
and just the actual type I'm I'm fine to
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:07.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay so let's see where we would let's
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
see where we would put that because we
 
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:11.660 align:start position:0%
can just write it right now so
 
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
line 15. okay so the incarcerated person
 
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
shall be provided at a choice of a
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
choice of feminine hygiene products to
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
include at a minimum pads tampons and
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
panty lighters a varying strengths
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
necessary for the menstrual needs so
 
00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:32.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily named brand I don't know
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
yeah you do you guys want to come up
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
we do have to actually have that in
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
there yeah it's crazy wherever wherever
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
you're wherever you're comfortable
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
sitting where I mean we're all just
 
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
or you might just put standard issue
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
before the word pads tampons and Penny
 
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.810 align:start position:0%
before the word pads tampons and Penny
liners

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
liners
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay so if we could put it
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
shall be provided so on line 14
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
so it says in car incarcerated person
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
shop he provided so we're thinking right
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
there a choice of standard issue a
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
choice of standard issue feminine
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
hygiene products starts after a choice
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
of and it's going to be the word
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:38.540 align:start position:0%
oh thank you so much
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
oh that'll be very helpful if I end up
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
being the one to go have this done do
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
you did you see what we're putting that
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
I do so Shelby provided a choice of
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
standard issue feminine hygiene products
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
so on line 20 where it says sanitized is
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
where it was suggested that the counties
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
May argue that what they're providing is
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
already sanitized and that the word new
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
since that is what the state does would
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
be preferable
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
yeah what line is that on line 20.
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
of the amended Amendment the amendment
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
okay in fact it shall be provided an
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
adequate number of sanitized would that
 
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
include sheets yeah so
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
the count the state may not provide new
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
sheets currently and I did send that
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
email to the county commissioner and had
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
not heard back specifically on that
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
issue she and she did approve this
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
language but I specifically went back
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and said are you okay specifically with
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
this line so I haven't heard back on
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
that yet but she already saw it
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
so our sheets are like assigned per
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
person so when laundry's done it's put
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
everything's labeled with people's names
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that if they if it has
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
blood or anything like that it's
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
disposed of with car with our current
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
practice but we also do have a policy
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
that kind of outlines what happens if
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of Bio contamination
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
and how that laundry is kept separate
 
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
and done differently and I can provide
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
that too if that's if yeah if we can
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
maybe draw for from the policies that
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't want to put the whole
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
possible no but like some some basic
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
summation of that I would think would be
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
suitable for putting into RSA regarding
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
the counties basically we understand
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
that the state already does a good job
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
at this and that the complaints that
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
we've gotten have been exclusively from
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
County facilities so I think lifting up
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
the County requirements to the level of
 
00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
the County requirements to the level of
State

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:51.380 align:start position:0%
okay all right so one of the things that
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that I believe that this is a dressing
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
right here which is line 20 but
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
this still doesn't say
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily new it just says shall be
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
provided in an adequate number and
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
sanitized before being provided to
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
another incarcerated person right so we
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
stole back to the you may get somebody
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
else's route I'm so sorry that you're in
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
here so I I actually think when I just
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
read the when this got printed I read
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
the wrong amendment number because I had
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
an amendment it was suggested to change
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
that to new and I had an amendment
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
drafted so I think we're working
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
specifically to to deal with changing
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
sanitize to new so but it's fine we can
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
work with this uh and then just change
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
it again
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
what what oh thanks Ellen
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so is that the new language was
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
already approved by the uh commissioner
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hanks I believe so but it only apply if
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
you notice it was only put into the
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
County Section and I wrote to her and
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
said this line the specific line that
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
we're discussing was only added to the
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
County Section are you okay with it with
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
the state and that's what I haven't
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
heard back on I just have a question I'm
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
just I mean as a nurse I've worked in
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
hospitals and blood is a you know I mean
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a pathogen but
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
um laundry services don't even though
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
laundry is Blood Stained maybe it is
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
sanitized with the intent to remove it
 
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
when it's not removable then it's
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
discarded I'm just a little worried
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
about when we say new everything that
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to be problematic okay in the
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
big I think the Senate you know but the
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
question is what does sanitize mean does
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
it mean
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
stained and or you know so that's I
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just being well we
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
started like they're trying to tell us
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
so let's see what they want to say thank
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
you and just for members of the
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horgan I
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
represent the association of counties
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um superintendent Henry apologizes he
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
can't be here because the opioid
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee is meeting at the same time
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
and he also sits on that so uh I did
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
just send him this amendment
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
um he is fine with all of the changes
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
that have just been discussed as he just
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
texted me and said yes that's fine
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so the counties have no problem with
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
this there we do have new
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
superintendents so all 10 counties
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
currently have a policy that products
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
are provided to female inmates similar
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
to the state it's a standard issue you
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
may not get the particular brand you
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
want but tampons pants panty liners are
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
all offered so so the only question that
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think that we're still all having is
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
if we put new does that mean that that
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
every you know superintendent Henry I
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
just gave him that change and he said
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
he's fine that makes sense to him
 
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.509 align:start position:0%
he's fine that makes sense to him
okay

00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:40.069 align:start position:0%
okay
excellent

00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my question is
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
I can foresee the challenge being if
 
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:46.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about both new
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
undergarments as well as new sheets new
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
bed linens and so I don't know if we
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
need rather than any item that might be
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
impacted by menstruation being new if
 
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.810 align:start position:0%
impacted by menstruation being new if
any

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:01.820 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
undergarments being new I mean I don't
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
know the idea of someone being and I
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
know that you said it doesn't happen at
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
the state level but the idea of any
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
person being issued anyone else's
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
panties recycled Underpants is
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's cruel and inhumane and and there's
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
no way that that can be
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're working on
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and we and we heard of at least two
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
people who had developed um infections
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
from yeah so I'm just wondering if
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
rather than leaving it as as broad as
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
any product if it needs to split it out
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
if we need to split that out so that
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
the understanding is under I mean I can
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
see sheets being okay properly sanitized
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
so where it says any items maybe instead
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
of any items provided maybe that should
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
say any undergarments provided by the
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
county incarceration first that are
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
impacted by menstruation shall be what
 
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
clothing could be impacted as well
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't so I don't necessarily think
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
a pair of jeans has the same impact
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
being if those right you know if those
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
were if those were used versus
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
undergarments so what if we say
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
undergarments for new and then sanitized
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
for any other product
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
I I actually like I like I mean I I wear
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
someone so you gave me a pair of jeans
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay I just have another suggestion
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
um just with the new thing I I
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
think we could achieve the same thing
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
without requiring that every time
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
somebody has you know a need for this
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
everything's new if we add just the
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
issue is the sanitized not necessarily
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
being sufficient so what if it says the
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
line 19 as it is and not in line 20
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall be provided in an
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
unstained adequate number oh an adequate
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
number comma unstained and sanitized
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
before that way if there's any stain on
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
it it's automatically rejected and if
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
they have to buy new they have to buy
 
00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:11.689 align:start position:0%
they have to buy new they have to buy
new

00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
but that's really the issue so is that
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
the undergarments so I I personally feel
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
the undergarments should be new do you I
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
every time for every person I don't
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
think that absolutely I don't think that
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
you can that's yeah I don't really
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there's an issue if
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
somebody I don't know what they wear in
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
prison I've never been there so
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the outer clothing to me
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
if that is used that to me is not a
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
problem that's not inhumane that's
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
normal I people give me clothes all the
 
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.350 align:start position:0%
normal I people give me clothes all the
time

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
the prop the problem that's becomes just
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
not acceptable is giving somebody
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else is used
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
so would that be a separate line keeping
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
this one adding the unstained unstained
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
and sanitized and then adding another
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
line for undergarments any undergarments
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
if you'd Mark right still be there I
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that that necessarily is if
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
you think so just take it out all
 
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
together or sheets that's what it would
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
cover the sheets right and undergarments
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
you could make it a little separate line
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
but any items provided by the county or
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
you could just say and I feel like I
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
think it's still appropriate for
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
clothing as well because I don't think
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
an inmate would necessarily want a blood
 
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
stain from somebody else on there I mean
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
I could imagine
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
problems socially speaking amongst
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
inmates if one person has a blood stain
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um so unstained I think is adequate for
 
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.770 align:start position:0%
um so unstained I think is adequate for
clothing

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
clothing
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
laundry right now the laundry policy is
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's the same for any inmate uh it's
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
gets washed regularly and they're
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
provided with female undergarments
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they're new or if that
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
and that's just for Rockingham County I
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
would have to check with all 10 to make
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody has the same policy
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes policy slightly vary from here
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
to there but I'm happy to shoot out an
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
email real quick and see if I can get an
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
answer on that while we're sitting here
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
if a if a person
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
generally speaking if a person needed
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
something new are they have you seen
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
where they're giving something that that
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
may still have a visible stain on it say
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
like a pair of of jeans or I don't know
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what you wear in
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
prison I
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know the answer off the top
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
of my head but I'm happy to try and find
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
out representative Rhodes okay
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so if and there's a difference too I
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
think between what you're issued
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
initially and from what I understand
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
from all the testimony we heard both in
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
the county and the state what happens is
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
you are in are issued specific clothing
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
for you when laundry day comes that
 
00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
clothing is bagged in a bag for you and
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
you get these same exact items back to
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
you and so there's a difference between
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
getting somebody else's stained and then
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
your own that's been laundered but you
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
know because I know I have stained
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
underwear so okay so then what so that's
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
the word thing I never thought I would
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
say that in recording
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
own back
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
then that's not necessarily so gross so
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
I would say shall initially be Pro so
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
undergarments specifically shall
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
initially be provided new
 
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:33.260 align:start position:0%
um and and then we can say returned
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
sanitized to the to the to the original
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
owner so is it more like it's an issue
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
of the original well more like it's an
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
issue of the original
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
um being issued it right we want to make
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
sure they're not being issued recycled
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
underwear is the main thing so saying
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
that undergarments shall be issued new
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
okay so hold on one second she's been
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
trying to say
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
did you have a question for me first I'm
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
just I'm thinking sorry the link the
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
English teacher in me is thinking the
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
language so upon
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
um arrival at the incarceration facility
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
shall be issued new underwear yeah you
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
could say something like upon arrival or
 
00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:14.419 align:start position:0%
upon intake I think either of those
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
and then with ours
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um we we do issue new underwear upon
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
arrival we also allow for the
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a additional pairs
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
every six months I I don't know that we
 
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
need to dive that far into it but that's
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
kind of what how we handle things and
 
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:39.980 align:start position:0%
then as far as laundry
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
also with the laundry everything that an
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
inmate owns is labeled so not just the
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
bag but I don't know how it's done in
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
um yes everybody has their name in every
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
piece of clothing that they have so
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's another way that we we keep it
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
separate but I would imagine the county
 
00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:02.179 align:start position:0%
is also label I will say for the record
 
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
if I apologize
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
will you I I
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
find it okay I thought she was asking
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
you I will say that since I don't think
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
um the representative from the counties
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
at the hearing for the record the people
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
who had the complaints about infections
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
and things were not from Rockingham
 
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.450 align:start position:0%
and things were not from Rockingham
County

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do you
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
understand that and I apologize to the
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
company for not being here but it was
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the session I didn't
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
mean to call you out I was just saying
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
in case like the Rockingham County
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
Commissioner was like no it wasn't
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
Rockingham that was the problem
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
all right so what I'm hearing is the the
 
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.810 align:start position:0%
all right so what I'm hearing is the the
clothing

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:37.820 align:start position:0%
clothing
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
foreign sorry I'm vertically challenged
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I can't ever reach my microphone so
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
the clothing is is
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
labeled just like it is in a nursing
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
home it's labeled when it goes off the
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
laundry and then that bag is also
 
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.330 align:start position:0%
laundry and then that bag is also
labeled

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
so getting it back to that particular
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
person is really not the issue
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue in our facility okay
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you in the counties
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
is it she's not sure she's look she's
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
frantically looking on she's frantically
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
looking into it what I currently have is
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
that upon intake undergarments uh shall
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
be provided in new condition and then
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
any other any any product let me see
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
what the wording was what line are you
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
on so that was the line that we created
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I would say we would add it yeah 19
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
and 20. so specifically adding a
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
statement on its own that's saying upon
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
intake undergarments shall be provided
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
new probably before the word or maybe at
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
the end of the paragraph but then the
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
other sentence is any items provided by
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
the county to incarcerate persons shall
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
be provided an accurate adequate number
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
unstained and sanitized so that would
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
cover also underwear
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that they have to
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
sanitize those panties it's been
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
assigned to you new but if you do stain
 
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:57.419 align:start position:0%
them then then it has to be sanitized
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
before they they give it back to you or
 
00:24:00.169 --> 00:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
if it's stained stained permanently then
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
they'll replace it that'll that all
 
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.890 align:start position:0%
they'll replace it that'll that all
makes

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
that all makes sense I think I think
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting this wording and again I
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
really don't mean to be ridiculous about
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm telling you last year some of
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
the things these people came up with I
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
was like what it's understandable where
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
do you live like how do you come up with
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
this stuff you know so now I don't want
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
to come back over two words
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck has a so would we
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
add that line to both
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to duplicate it for
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
both the state and the county
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
and procedurally so it'll be between
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
line ninth it'll be between lines 19 and
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
20 is where we're going to add that and
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
then the word unstained will be after so
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
it says and in inadequate
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
number unstained and sanitized before
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
being provided did you have something I
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
have an answer on the laundry
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
so uh each facility each shell is
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
different it depends upon if they use
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
laundry bags but for the most part
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're mainly sharing clothing uh it's
 
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
all washed dried and they get fresh
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
clothes as a clothing exchange they have
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
inmates come in and get clean use
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
clothes they uh superintendent Henry did
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
want me to mention that they could never
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
afford new clothes for inmates every
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
single time
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
but if they're damaged or something like
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a different
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
situation well I think that's what we're
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
what were you going to say I'm just
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
building on what she just said that I
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're going for is
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
that if it's stained then we're
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
providing new we're taking out of
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
circulation but if it's you know if it's
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
clean there's no stain it's been
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just gonna so I was thinking
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
that regardless if it was still stained
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
if it was cleaned and sanitized for the
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
same person it would be reused for the
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
same person it would be taken out of
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
circulation after that person leaves for
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
someone who's coming in new aside from
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
undergarments which would be it sounds
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
like what we just heard is not every
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
County duplicates the state process of
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
making sure those particular items
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
always go back to the same incarcerated
 
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:16.460 align:start position:0%
person so
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the counties are willing
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
to duplicate the state process and have
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
those items always be returned to the
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
individual they will if we pass the RSA
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
it's well well true I am a big advocate
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we are the ones that
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
write the policy they have to follow it
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay so basically we're on the same page
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
here that
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
if it's yours originally and it comes
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
then that is okay what we don't want is
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
this has you know some some stained
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
residue on it which is clean and
 
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.230 align:start position:0%
residue on it which is clean and
sanitized

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
sanitized
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
right but going to
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
somebody different right
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
um so superintendent I just asked the
 
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
question uh whether or not it's new
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
underwear or not and superintendent
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
Henry said no it's washed and cleaned if
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's ripped or Stained it's
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
automatically disposed of
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
so we're codifying what some counties
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
are doing that sounds fine
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
but he's still saying it's not new Under
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
so they we're saying they have to be
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
issued new when they're brought in and
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
and he's he's fine with that change to
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
new I did ask him that okay I'm glad can
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
I just like off topic say how happy I am
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.710 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
[Laughter]

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
no I don't I think the chair was
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
probably made a wise decision in that
 
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.710 align:start position:0%
probably made a wise decision in that
case

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
about time wondering if when if we need
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
to give a floor speech on this if we'll
 
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
need to bring in show and please God no
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.590 align:start position:0%
need to bring in show and please God no
[Laughter]

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.990 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
yes

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
this will be a 20-0 on consent that's
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
you I will say just for anyone new that
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
our house rules do state we're not
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring props
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
to the floor I'm just saying we could
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
you could wear it if it's you know you
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
fashion into like a brooch or something
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
on consent I like it your job
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
one little thing that had been
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
irritating me in the back of my head
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I never put into the language is
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
and this would be probably
 
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.470 align:start position:0%
and this would be probably
line

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh earlier in
 
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.049 align:start position:0%
uh earlier in
[Laughter]

00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
he's like I'm just here
 
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
everything's a teachable moment what
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
happened did I miss something or did I
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay yes he's like the how what shade
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
of crimson has he turned
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
I I want to add when menstrual products
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
are provided that they provided be
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
provided in a timely manner because some
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
of the stories I was personally told was
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
that maybe there was a delay between
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
when they would ask and when it would
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
get approved so I I don't know if this
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be okay with the
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
words in a timely manner so I think
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're back I so I think we're back to
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's a probably a judgment what does
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
timely manner mean to one person and
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
another is that indeed does that have to
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
be I mean how do you identify timely
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
manner it's the kind of thing that would
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
go to court and be right so I don't know
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
if we I don't know if that is something
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
that that can be
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
regulated how would you guys within
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
determine a number of hours
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
have it like that
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
spelled out in our policy unfortunately
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
it's not it's kind of not really a
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
second thought it's just provided the
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
same way we would provide toilet paper
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
or and I know that like our mail
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers that have the belts
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
they carry tampons in there just in case
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
somebody needs one so it's I mean it's
 
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
not really a availability issue there so
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know when you're in the hospital
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
and so as an example I'm there for four
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
days I rep I wrecked my snowmobile and I
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
broke both sides of my pelvis and my
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
shoulder and they would say you know you
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
have to push the magic button to ask for
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
the magic pill in you know half an hour
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
later whoa now I'm dying right and
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of pain that's yeah so but
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
to them they had to put in the order
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
they had to get it right so then I was
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
like all right well I'll ask for it a
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
half an hour ahead of time so that it's
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
there in that half an hour nope you
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
can't do that because you know by the
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
timing so to them that was a timely
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
manner to me it wasn't very efficient
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't may I ask the representatives
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
from the prison in jails um if an hour
 
00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable can we put a time in
 
00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:07.789 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable can we put a time in
there

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
caution you against putting a time
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
putting them in a specific time just
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
because something is always going to
 
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.889 align:start position:0%
because something is always going to
happen

00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't make that time what does
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
that mean and if you say like well I got
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
it to them in three days then yeah see
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's not really reasonable is it so
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
what would what do we do do you have a
 
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.370 align:start position:0%
what would what do we do do you have a
suggestion

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
that I think the function of reasonable
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
in the law isn't to guide the person
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
implementing it it's really to initiate
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
a discussion during litigation
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
and so the concern over setting a time
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
limit is over litigation it's kind of
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
neither here nor there because if when
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
you get to the point of debating what
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable was you're in litigation so
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
maybe the sort of Middle Ground would be
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
to say within an hour unless
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances require
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
um something along those lines barring
 
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
so I I agree with you I'm not trying to
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
make it have to be necessarily a lawsuit
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
well we want I think it's a judgment of
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
what reasonable is to some people I mean
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
reasonable is
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
in the point of adding even if it's that
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
squishy term of reasonable the point of
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
adding it is so that if there is a
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
county that has been grossly negligent
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
and has caused someone to wait for days
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
they have that to go to in the RSA they
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
can then make a case to a judge and say
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
this wasn't reasonable three days is not
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a menstrual product
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so it there's I think we need to have
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
something addressing time in there I
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
just it's how how specific the
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wants to get I'm happy to
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
be as squishy or specific as you all
 
00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:50.690 align:start position:0%
be as squishy or specific as you all
like

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
What were what
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
what do you guys have in yours is this
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
is this a problem that we actually do we
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
have to make sure we put in here
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
I would say we don't have a problem
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
like in general we haven't needed to put
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
that into our policy because we haven't
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
had that problem at the president with
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
with somebody not getting it and what
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
they consider to be a timely manner but
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
I I defer I mean so if we put it in
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
there you guys are already doing it
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's it's kind of right it's
 
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
happening anyway I think saying
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
something like an hour is very specific
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I I would be I would be concerned
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
with an hour
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
um but two hours I don't think we should
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
put a time frame what were you going to
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
say represent I was just going to say
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
um on that line between 11 and 13. you
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
we could say something about you know
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent blah blah blah she'll
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
provide the products to all people who
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
went straight in the custody of the
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
county an adequate Amounts is necessary
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
at no cost to such person
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
um and uh in a timely manner and no and
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
um something about intermediency and uh
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
and uh meeting the immediacy needs of
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the inmate or something so nobody's
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
waiting and to address the urgency or
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
something I'm just in such a way
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
that it's an immediate need you can't
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
wait necessarily immediate needs yeah
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
well if you mean grammar yes but if you
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
mean intense no
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
so is there a
 
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.589 align:start position:0%
so is there a
grammatical

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
grammatical
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
I just think the immediacy it doesn't
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
give a specific hour or whatever but
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's certainly prescribes that there's
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
an expectation that people should not
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
have to wait for something that is an
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
immediate need and and I like that I
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
like that terminology it's sort of a we
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
know when you need it you need it
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
and then I like that all right so I have
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
you guys got that written down you got
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that written down over there in such a
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
way as to meet any immediate need
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
I like that it's just immediately sense
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
of urgency hurry up yeah
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
I have it are you up on an amusement
 
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.970 align:start position:0%
I have it are you up on an amusement
park

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
will what who sends all this to get
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
revised I'm happy to volunteer my
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
services but anybody
 
00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:17.579 align:start position:0%
can do it so this is what this is what
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.310 align:start position:0%
will happen
um

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
I would say that representative Reed's
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
making all these notes because you know
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
this is kind of her her little project
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
so she will take it and have it amended
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
again and then she'll give it back to
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
she'll send it back to the committee and
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
then when we actually do the executive
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
session on this
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
somebody will will say that they want to
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
make a motion about to pass this
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and they offer Amendment
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
whatever this amendment number is and
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
then we'll discuss that Amendment and
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
then we'll first vote for the amendment
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
and then after that we'll vote to pass
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
um all right but for this for today what
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
are we going to do here
 
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.430 align:start position:0%
are we going to do here
um

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the amendment number is going to
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
completely change yes yes right like
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
multiple Madam chair all right so this
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this little paper I have is kind of
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
irrelevant right now because of the
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment number that we have is going
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
to be a different amendment number
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
so the the changes I have just to recap
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
um at on line 13 after the words at no
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
cost to such person I have uh and in
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
such a way that meets any immediate
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
needs on line 14 I have after the words
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
provided a choice of insert standard
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
issue feminine hygiene products
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then the lines 19 and 20 we are
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
saying any items provided by the county
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
and this will be duplicated to the state
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
all this language I'm saying uh to
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerate persons that are impacted by
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
Administration shall be provided in an
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
adequate number unstained and sanitized
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
before being provided and that upon
 
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
intake undergarments shall be provided
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
in a new condition
 
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.450 align:start position:0%
in a new condition
mm-hmm

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
where where are you putting the upon
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
intake are you putting at the end of
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
this sentence
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
so after 21 after that line 21 at the
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
end of that paragraph before section the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
second paragraph
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
my thought would be
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
on line 19 where it says menstruation
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
period see that yes
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
if we put
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
the first part about upon intake first
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
okay because that's kind of comes the
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
logical sequence yeah okay yeah so if we
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
put that line first about upon intake
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
whatever that wording is and then after
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
that any items provided that are been
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
with you yeah does that make sense it
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
does make sense I don't care I feel like
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
we're going backwards if we do it the
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
other way no I don't I would actually
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
stay awake at night I appreciate the on
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
that the Nuance there I do welcome to my
 
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
that the Nuance there I do welcome to my
world

00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
awesome all right well ladies do you
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
have anything that we did not address or
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
that we need to change or anything input
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I appreciate the
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak did we beat this
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
dead horse
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
but a room full of women came to a
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
consensus about language and I love it
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here for it I would just ask that uh
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative Reed shared the final
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment with me so I can run it not
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties obviously host females
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
just so I can run it past those
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
superintendents because I need your
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
email address yes uh superintendent
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
Henry is obviously only one of ten so
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I would appreciate both your email
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
addresses and I will make sure if you
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
want all subcommittee members if you
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
want I can include all of you as
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on the amendment so that
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
everybody's name is on it
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
I'm happy
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
