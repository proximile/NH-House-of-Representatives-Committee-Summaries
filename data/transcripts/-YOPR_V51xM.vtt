so I believe that's where we're probably
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
so I believe that's where we're probably
the<00:00:53.039><c> best</c><00:00:53.160><c> place</c><00:00:53.399><c> to</c><00:00:53.579><c> pick</c><00:00:53.700><c> it</c><00:00:53.820><c> up</c><00:00:53.940><c> from</c><00:00:54.180><c> thank</c>

that too if that's if yeah if we can

maybe draw for from the policies that

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
if we put new does that mean that that
 

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:32.750 align:start position:0%

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.850 align:start position:0%
write the policy they have to follow it
okay<00:26:35.880><c> so</c><00:26:36.360><c> basically</c><00:26:36.779><c> we're</c><00:26:37.140><c> on</c><00:26:37.320><c> the</c><00:26:37.500><c> same</c><00:26:37.679><c> page</c>

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay so basically we're on the same page
 

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.890 align:start position:0%
okay so basically we're on the same page
here<00:26:38.100><c> that</c>

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
here that
 

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.409 align:start position:0%
here that
if<00:26:40.380><c> it's</c><00:26:40.620><c> yours</c><00:26:41.039><c> originally</c><00:26:41.760><c> and</c><00:26:42.000><c> it</c><00:26:42.120><c> comes</c>

00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
if it's yours originally and it comes
 

00:26:42.419 --> 00:26:43.909 align:start position:0%
if it's yours originally and it comes
back<00:26:42.539><c> to</c><00:26:42.779><c> you</c>

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
back to you
 

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
back to you
then<00:26:44.460><c> that</c><00:26:44.760><c> is</c><00:26:45.059><c> okay</c><00:26:45.240><c> what</c><00:26:46.140><c> we</c><00:26:46.320><c> don't</c><00:26:46.500><c> want</c><00:26:46.799><c> is</c>

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
then that is okay what we don't want is
 

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.049 align:start position:0%
then that is okay what we don't want is
this<00:26:48.659><c> has</c><00:26:49.200><c> you</c><00:26:49.860><c> know</c><00:26:49.919><c> some</c><00:26:50.159><c> some</c><00:26:50.580><c> stained</c>

that's<00:31:24.000><c> not</c><00:31:24.179><c> really</c><00:31:24.419><c> reasonable</c><00:31:24.840><c> is</c><00:31:25.140><c> it</c><00:31:25.380><c> so</c>

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's not really reasonable is it so

this<00:32:34.559><c> wasn't</c><00:32:34.740><c> reasonable</c><00:32:35.159><c> three</c><00:32:35.399><c> days</c><00:32:35.580><c> is</c><00:32:35.760><c> not</c>

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
this wasn't reasonable three days is not
 

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
this wasn't reasonable three days is not
reasonable<00:32:36.240><c> for</c><00:32:36.480><c> a</c><00:32:36.600><c> menstrual</c><00:32:36.899><c> product</c>

happening anyway I think saying
 

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.009 align:start position:0%
happening anyway I think saying
something<00:33:20.279><c> like</c><00:33:20.580><c> an</c><00:33:20.760><c> hour</c><00:33:20.940><c> is</c><00:33:21.240><c> very</c><00:33:21.600><c> specific</c>

00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
something like an hour is very specific
 

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:24.350 align:start position:0%
something like an hour is very specific
so<00:33:22.440><c> I</c><00:33:22.620><c> I</c><00:33:22.799><c> would</c><00:33:23.039><c> be</c><00:33:23.220><c> I</c><00:33:23.640><c> would</c><00:33:23.760><c> be</c><00:33:23.880><c> concerned</c>
