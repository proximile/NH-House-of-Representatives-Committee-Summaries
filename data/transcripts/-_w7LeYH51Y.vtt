additional information
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
because we didn't really have a clear
 
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start position:0%
because we didn't really have a clear
[Music]

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
understanding of what he was asking for
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
so representative wyler if you would
 
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
please tell us about your amendment and
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
why you think it's important
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair and my local
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
school board is
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's two towns represented and
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
the way they read the law and so there's
 
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
the way they read the law and so there's
this

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
in effect i think two members from
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
kingston two members from newton
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
and one member at large and the way they
 
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.510 align:start position:0%
and one member at large and the way they
interpreted

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
the law if somebody resigned or died of
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
any of those members
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
that the board would replace
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
that member but it was their reading of
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
the law was if it was somebody from
 
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
the law was if it was somebody from
kingston

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
kingston
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
then really it only came down to the
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
kingston person would have a hand in
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
selecting the
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
replacement but it said
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
the person that was the at-large member
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether they were elected in kingston or
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
in newton
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
were denied a say in who would
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
replace the absent number
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make sense especially if
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
that person the member at large was
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
elected in the same town
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
as the as the member that was absent
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
and even if they were from the next town
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
they were still uh elected in the town
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the person was absent from so they
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
they had roots they felt in both towns
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly in the town
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
that they came from and the board
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
decided no that wasn't the case
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
because you weren't as a member
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
as the member from kingston in fact but
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they they argued about that and it
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear in the law so they asked me
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
to try to change the law so it was clear
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
that the at-large member
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
if especially if they were from the same
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
town as as a
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
person being replaced then they should
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
have a vote in that or have a
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
have a hand in selecting that person i
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
agreed with
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
last year i submitted the bill it passed
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
through the education committee
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
the senate like so many other of our
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
efforts um
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
it either got i can't remember exactly
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
whether it got
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
tabled or just jumbled in a bill with 24
 
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.350 align:start position:0%
tabled or just jumbled in a bill with 24
other

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
things many of which were not popular so
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't go anywhere
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
and i forgot about that i kind of lost
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
track of it once i passed it through the
 
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.230 align:start position:0%
track of it once i passed it through the
house

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and the member that asked me to
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
put it in called up and said you know
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't go anywhere i said all
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
right i'll put it in again but by the
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
time they told me that
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
we'd already passed the filing period so
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
i was hopeful that since it's
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
deals with education and division two
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
deals with education that
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
i i could have it supported to put it in
 
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
i i could have it supported to put it in
hb2

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
because it is it is an important issue
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
for my town
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it was passed through the education
 
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.629 align:start position:0%
and it was passed through the education
committee

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
previously and and they supported it
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm hopeful that you will put it in
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
hb2 thank you
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions are there
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
anyone has uh representative murray
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and this
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
is by and large for my own education
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
um first a member at large it would be
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding that that person
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
isn't representing any particular
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
area or issue or any entity in a
 
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
area or issue or any entity in a
committee

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
that's for me a definition of member at
 
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
that's for me a definition of member at
large

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
so what does it matter if you're
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
replacing a member at large
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
where that member comes from as you know
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be a if it's a member at
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
large shouldn't it continue to be a
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
member at large
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
and does this bill kind of hamstring
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
what the intent of member at large is
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you i think it does in
 
00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.310 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you i think it does in
effect

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
because the issue that brought it to a
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
head was
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
not the member at large replacement but
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
one of the other replacements
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
in this instance i think it was somebody
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
in kingston being
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
had resigned or death excuse me or died
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
and they had to be replaced and so the
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
member at large
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
was elected in kingston and in newton
 
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
was elected in kingston and in newton
and

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
supposedly only the member that was
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
elected as the kingston member that was
 
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
elected as the kingston member that was
remaining

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
would be the one that would choose the
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
replacement that didn't make sense to
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
the member at large
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
because she was also from kingston so
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
i felt she had a right to pick the
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
person or have a hand in it so
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i could agree with that and i could
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
see that you know if she was from
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
kingston and
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
knew the people in kingston that she
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be just as likely to
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
know who to put in that job as as the
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
one that was singularly
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
elected from kingston so that's what the
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill does and they
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
didn't even give it a thought to what
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
would happen it requires to be replaced
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray urban peace i
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
believe you were next
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair um just so
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
um in um a consolidated school district
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
um it's usually when they come together
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
to be an sau
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh they merge in the sau board
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
in uh yes it is the sau board you're
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
talking about i presume
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
so the sau board is weighted according
 
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
so the sau board is weighted according
to

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
the populations of each town
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so what you are recommending
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
is that when one of those at large
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
members needs to be replaced
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
then in fact it will be
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
the whole body or just the single town
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
from which that individual came
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember how i don't know
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have it in front of me
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
but i think it's maybe the nomination
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
would come from
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
the people in the town that
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
had lost the member so if they could
 
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.829 align:start position:0%
had lost the member so if they could
continue

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
to vote on it but the nominations would
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
be from the people in the town
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
would there be there would be no vote
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and then the town
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
then keeps control of
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
their member and does not need to go out
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
for a vote with all three towns
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't think it would no but maybe
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
the total board would vote
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
but the nomination and and likely
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
would come from the people within the
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
town that lost the member
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah uh representative
 
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.829 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah uh representative
heath

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
heath
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
that person would only be appointed
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
until the next election
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
right okay and so that would
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
you know whatever whenever that was yeah
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative lynn you have a
 
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
okay representative lynn you have a
question

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
oh did you want to follow up mary i did
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
understand the process um so what this
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
would do is simply solidify the process
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
and there wouldn't be any questions
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's my hope yes okay thank you
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um uh
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative while i i
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
i understand completely what you're
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
saying and it seems to me this makes a
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh the only question the only question
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
is i mean as you just as you just
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
what in in the example that you use what
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
it seems not to cover the situation
 
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.069 align:start position:0%
it seems not to cover the situation
where

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
the person that uh resigns or
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know if for some reason uh no longer
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
remember the board
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
is the at-large member and so i wonder
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
um how how would we how do
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that that happens now how
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
do how is that at large member
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
replaced i think the way that the way it
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
reads even if it's the at-large member
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
what town was the at-large member from
 
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:54.389 align:start position:0%
what town was the at-large member from
and

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
was remaining from that town would be
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that nominate
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
or appoint the successor okay i see what
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying i see what you're saying
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
all right whether
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
whichever town it was from
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%

so i will turn it over to representative
lin

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%

thank you uh
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
so um i as i i i sent representative
 
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.629 align:start position:0%
so um i as i i i sent representative
umberger

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh an email uh yesterday and i think
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh i guess the the bottom line
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
i suppose that way to put this is that
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
uh it's a punt
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
the supreme court decision is sort of a
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
punt in that
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
um it didn't make a final decision it
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
sent it back
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the trial court
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
but i i guess you know reading
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh and and this this is obviously i
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not a member of the supreme court i
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the supreme court i can
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
only make some predictions and they may
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
or may not be correct
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
but i think one of the one of the
 
00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:54.069 align:start position:0%
but i think one of the one of the
takeaways

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
takeaways
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
from this is that to the extent
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh that those challenging
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
the um what the legislature had done
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
with the school funding
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
you know in recent years to the extent
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
that they had the belief
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
that um they were just going to be able
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you know this is what um
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is the cost of education that the
 
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.069 align:start position:0%
this is the cost of education that the
education

00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
establishment thinks is what is what is
 
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.389 align:start position:0%
establishment thinks is what is what is
needed

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
and that was kind of going to be the end
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
of it which is
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
sort of what the trial court did i think
 
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.069 align:start position:0%
sort of what the trial court did i think
the the

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
supreme court kind of you know threw
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
cold water on that that that's not gonna
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna be um the way this is
 
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna be um the way this is
handled

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
and sent it back to the trial court and
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
i would i and i suspect i could be wrong
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
on this but i suspect
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
that this is there's going to be a
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
discovery process and then a
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy trial on the merits where
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
where this kind of this issue will be
 
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
where this kind of this issue will be
very

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
very hotly contested as to exactly what
 
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0%
very hotly contested as to exactly what
does

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
um an adequate education cost what
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
factors are
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh go into uh
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
establishing an adequate education and i
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
think particularly
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
i thought particularly interesting is
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
language in the court's decision that i
 
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
language in the court's decision that i
think

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
really raises the issue uh uh
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
not er at least it seems to me
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
not everything that it go that is a cost
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
of education is a cost for an adequate
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
education in other words there may be
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that a school district spends money on
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
um and i don't mean to say in it i don't
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
mean to suggest that it's that
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
spending the money is inappropriate but
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
there may be many things that a school
 
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
there may be many things that a school
district

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
spends money on that the court will
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately say okay
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that's not part of an
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
um so that for example i i i think that
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the school districts
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
that were challenging this were saying
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know the cost
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the legislature in that basic
 
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.789 align:start position:0%
whereas the legislature in that basic
appropriation

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
before there's added for the free and uh
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
other costs uh um non-english speakers
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
but in the basic um cost of of an
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
it was around at the time i think 2019
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
around 3 500 or 3 600
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the school districts were saying oh
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's 16 or 17
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
000 uh per student um
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's that's there's a great deal of
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
room in there
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court i think uh
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not going to i shouldn't
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
say made it clear
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
raised real real questions about whether
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things that school
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
districts may
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh spend money on are really what is
 
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
uh spend money on are really what is
required

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education so
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
you know my takeaway from this is i said
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
to representative umbergers i
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
i tend to think that if i were a
 
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
i tend to think that if i were a
litigant

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
litigant
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
on the representing the state if i were
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
if i were a lawyer representing the
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
state i would feel
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
much better about the supreme court's
 
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
much better about the supreme court's
decision

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
than if i were a lawyer representing the
 
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
than if i were a lawyer representing the
challenge

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
challenging school districts that's not
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
to say that there ultimately
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
the school districts won't win in some
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
fashion but
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
i do think that um the
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
people that were defending uh the
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislative the
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
defending the law um probably are
 
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
defending the law um probably are
feeling

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh better about the decision than the
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of i'm happy to try to
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
if anybody has it uh representative
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
murray you have a question
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um the commission on
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy that finished its work just i
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
guess in the past several months or so
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
do you think that being such a new
 
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
do you think that being such a new
report

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
impacted the court's decision to say you
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
know you need to go back and look at
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
this some more
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
and since that is out now and it wasn't
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
out when some of this was going on
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
do you think they will make either side
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
we'll make use of
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
the findings from that commission uh
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
going forward to try to figure out you
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
know answering the questions that you
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
just asked
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
no excellent question and i think you
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
know i don't um i don't remember the
 
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.630 align:start position:0%
know i don't um i don't remember the
court

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
referring to the newest
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
report and i think probably that's
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
because that
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't that may not have been issued
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the time the trial court made
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
its decision and so you know the way the
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
process works is the supreme court can
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
only consider what was before the trial
 
00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
only consider what was before the trial
court

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
so if the trial court didn't have the
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefit of that then
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
the supreme court really really uh would
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
it would have been kind of improper for
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
to consider it but on remand now you
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
know i
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think yes i'm sure that um
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know in in term in trying to
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
determine factually
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
what um what goes into an adequate
 
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.190 align:start position:0%
what um what goes into an adequate
education

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure that the the the uh
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
both sides will probably you know make
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
reference to that and the court the
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
trial court i think will
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
will almost necessarily have to you know
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
at least deal with what
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
so any other any other questions i'm
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you uh judge uh for taking
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh are you familiar with the uh what
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
happened in new jersey i believe they
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
had a claremont decision
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh their academic achievement has uh not
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
improved a bit
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
and they're spending in the abbott
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
districts there which are the poor
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
districts are spending
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
over forty four thousand dollars per
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.310 align:start position:0%
over forty four thousand dollars per
student

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not i i sort of am generally
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
familiar that there
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
are you know there are a number what you
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
should bear in mind
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
is this uh way back in 1973
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court rejected
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of under the federal
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
constitution the kind of claim that was
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
made in the claremont case
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh basically saying that you know there
 
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh basically saying that you know there
um

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
there is no constitutional right to
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh um an adequate quote-unquote uh
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
education or equal funding of education
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
that's just not something that the
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
federal constitution grants in the wake
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
of that a number of states
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
new jersey kentucky and i think you know
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the number now but quite a
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
number have said that their state
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
constitution provides
 
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:42.750 align:start position:0%
um this protection um
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.390 align:start position:0%
um this protection um
[Music]

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
i the the problem this is now this is me
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
speak you know
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
people may have i understand that people
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
have a much people may have a much
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
different take on this than i do but
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is me speaking i
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh candidly think that it
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
that this is not a very smart move for
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
states to adopt this because what it
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
involves in the end is
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know stop and think about this
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
the court instead of
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
instead of us in the legislature
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
deciding how much money to appropriate
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
to education
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i've been don't get me wrong i
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
personally am
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
very much favor the idea that poorer
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
school districts ought to get
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
aid from the state i don't have any
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that at all
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
but the idea that um
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be the legislature that
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
decides that issue
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
but instead the court um
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm i think that's i'm very
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that because i think
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
what it really means is
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
let's you know let's it essentially
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
means that you've got the court
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
substituting its judgment for the
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislature on what
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
on how much money is is appropriate to
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
be spent on education
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
and more importantly what the trade-offs
 
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:00.710 align:start position:0%
and more importantly what the trade-offs
are

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
if the if education were the only thing
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
we were spending money on
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
it might be one thing but there's you
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
know a whole bunch of
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
different things that we have to spend
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
money on and so the problem i see and i
 
00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
money on and so the problem i see and i
think

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
the case the states that have adopted
 
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.430 align:start position:0%
the case the states that have adopted
this

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
their whose courts have adopted this the
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
problem is it's kind of never-ending
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
so you know let's assume that the
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs are right and that you know
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of money that's being
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
spent spent for an adequate education
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
now the court says
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's not enough okay so now we
 
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.029 align:start position:0%
that's not enough okay so now we
appropriate

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
more money um so five years from now or
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
three years from now or
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
ten years from now the somebody will say
 
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.350 align:start position:0%
ten years from now the somebody will say
and

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
and this is i what i think is the real
 
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
and this is i what i think is the real
problem

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
if this by saying that this is a
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional right it really means
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
that anybody
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know it could be it it here it was a
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
several school districts
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
but it could be anybody that can say oh
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
wait a minute i don't think the state's
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
spending enough money i'm bringing a
 
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
spending enough money i'm bringing a
lawsuit

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
and

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately the court as opposed to the
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislature will decide how much money
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
should be spent
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
i i i'm i'm very troubled by by
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
that idea so but that's that's my you
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
know that's my personal take on this
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i think that the the spending
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that that the new jersey
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
case and others
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
indicate that the spending issue is not
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
um is not uh
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
in any way kind of closely related to
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
educational performance
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh at least that's my
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
take on
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
but anyway that's the you know many of
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
you may i'm sure may disagree with that
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of my take uh representative heath
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you ma'am chair this is like an
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue that has caused angst for
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
um i agree that that the courts
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
won't tell us what to do
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
but the courts will advise
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
the body the general court then in fact
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
they need to come up with a better way
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of children in the co
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
in our our national in our federal
 
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
in our our national in our federal
constitution

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
they left education to
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
the states to decide how to determine
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
um how to address that issue and so i
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
i do think that we bear responsibility
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
the other issue that really being on the
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
school funding commission
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
this this past year really pointed to
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
the deep discrepancies in the level
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
to which different communities
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
can afford to really address
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
the needs of education in their
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
communities you know
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
we just saw the huge difference in in
 
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
we just saw the huge difference in in
the

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh property tax burden that different
 
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh property tax burden that different
towns

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
carry and um i think that's something
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
that in all of this
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
and again it goes back to the report
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
from the commission i think it's
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
incredibly important that somewhere
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
along the line
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i think we did that um at some point
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
um provided funding in one of our
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
previous bills
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i just i just think it's a
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
consideration that we have to address
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
because i think ultimately economically
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
for our state
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
the product of the children that we
 
00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
the product of the children that we
produce

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
in all our communities results in
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
higher qualified future employers and
 
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
higher qualified future employers and
employees

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you judge i really appreciate
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
your comments
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
um because it just it brings home so
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
many of the issues we've we've
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
really talked about for so long and and
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
muddled with and it's been very
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.350 align:start position:0%
muddled with and it's been very
difficult

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of massachusetts and new jersey
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to both of those just
 
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to both of those just
quickly

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
both of those states have undergone
 
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
both of those states have undergone
really

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
total school reform and and with that
 
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
total school reform and and with that
reform

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
have seen significant improvements in
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
their students achievement
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
as we know massachusetts is listed
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
number one on the nape
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
and new jersey which was drastically
 
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
and new jersey which was drastically
lower

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
lower
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
has come up to one of the um top states
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
so there has been improvement
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
based on the addition of funding
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
provided so um i
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
i thank you judge again and i will be
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
quiet thank you
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i hope
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
folks will indulge me and allow
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
to ask a question representative wyler
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sharon thank you it just
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
seems like this
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
is almost an annual thing i know you've
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
dealt with it
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
with supreme court and lower lower
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
courts and
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's it never ends and i think one of
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
the reasons the union always is trying
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
to kill the charter schools as they
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
serve as a
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
prime example that an adequate education
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
can be done for seven
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
thousand but another issue that i've
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
seen several members
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
online tossing around is the unfunded
 
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
online tossing around is the unfunded
mandate

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and i remember an
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and i remember an
earlier

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if it was a supreme
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
court or a circuit court
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
with the decision you know if so we're
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
spending about 40 percent of the of the
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 percent of the cost is from the
 
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 percent of the cost is from the
state

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
and every time the state decides there's
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
going to be some addition
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
to what's required like a civics program
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
then they come back and they sue and
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
call it an unfunded mandate and my
 
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.230 align:start position:0%
call it an unfunded mandate and my
reelection

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
reelection
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh my remembrance is that the court said
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
as long as you're getting money you
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
can't say it's unfunded
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter they you know they
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't tell you exactly how to spend the
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
money but
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're giving you money they give you a
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
new mandate
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you've gotten money it's not unfunded
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
you think that's still the feeling
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you well i i
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
i say i i actually had occasion i was
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
the author of the decision
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
that said um you know it was okay for
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
not to fund the municipal retirement
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh system and that was i think it was a
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
four to one decision i believe justice
 
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.710 align:start position:0%
four to one decision i believe justice
convoy

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
convoy
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
dissented in that but i think it was
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
either a four to one or three to one
 
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.029 align:start position:0%
either a four to one or three to one
decision

00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate it i'm the one that made
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
the change
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
but it um one of the i one of the
 
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
but it um one of the i one of the
problems

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think that we you know that we re that
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
was the basis of the decision not the
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
total basis but in part was
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
that it's um
 
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.830 align:start position:0%
that it's um
[Music]

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
the the things like
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh like the like the retirement fund and
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
that i i suppose it would have
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
implications here
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know for in the in the
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
hypothetically you pose because if the
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
state says okay you have to do
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know you have to now teach x
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
um presumably that's gonna
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's gonna mean some funding for
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
personnel and yet
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
the state has no control over
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
personnel and that was one of the big
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
things that you know
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the the city of manchester or for
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know from
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
from the biggest city to the smallest
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
town they get to make their own
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
decisions on how much how many
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
how much how many how many employees
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
how much their employees are paid and
 
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.990 align:start position:0%
how much their employees are paid and
yet

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
if they could if the if the
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know non-funded mandate provision
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
meant that the legislature
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
um was kind of stuck with that it would
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
really interfe
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
it would really interfere basically with
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature's ability to appropriate
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
money and to decide how much
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
how much funding goes to uh to
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
to various things so i think you're
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
right that i think we basically did say
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
in that case that if there's been
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know if there's been um
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
some uh if there's been
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
some funding by localities for
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
for for you know sort of general
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
categories of things like employees
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
than the state um then the fact that the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
state changes its contribution is not
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't result in an unfunded mandate
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
as i say that's not the only factor
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other factors that
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
went into it but that's certainly one of
 
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
went into it but that's certainly one of
them

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
lynn

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you from uh
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
speaking to us from your experience um
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh insightful
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
and i know that we will all be waiting
 
00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.269 align:start position:0%
and i know that we will all be waiting
for

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the trial court decides to
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh move forward with and uh i'm not sure
 
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.430 align:start position:0%
uh move forward with and uh i'm not sure
that

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have a decision on that
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
during this
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
legislative session if in fact they do
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
what they've been directed to do
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
so anyhow it'll be fun and uh
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
it may be um you know two years before
 
00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.629 align:start position:0%
it may be um you know two years before
we

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
come up with any any decision on that
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you again and
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay um
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
we have uh an amendment
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
is that the next thing we want to do uh
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
at this point we have three amendments
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
um okay to be considered and one of the
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
three amendments would
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
require a reconsideration of an
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
amendment with that we previously
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
approved so
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
we can take these three up in any order
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
that works for you and um
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful to walk through a screen
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
share we can do that
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
um you tell us what you want to do yeah
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
let's do the
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendment on the
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
44 million sure so this would be
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 2021-1019h
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i think this was sent out to
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
and this is an amendment that uh that
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
would require
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of amendment zero nine
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
eight nine
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
h that we had previously adopted and the
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
reason for that is
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh both amendments ultimately result in
 
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh both amendments ultimately result in
a

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
transfer from the education trust fund
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the general fund
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment one zero one nine h takes
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
previous actions and updates that
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
transfer amount required we would not
 
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
transfer amount required we would not
wanna

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
pass both so we would wanna supersede
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
zero nine eight nine with this should
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
the division adopt it
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay um you want to uh
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
walk us through what what this is uh
 
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.589 align:start position:0%
walk us through what what this is uh
suggesting

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
sure so andrea has the amendment shared
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
on the screen right now so
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
um as of all the committee's action
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
to this point um there is
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
about 40 just over 41 million dollars
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
remaining in the education trust fund
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
based on the revised house ways and
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
means revenues
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment would do is
 
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.230 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment would do is
essentially

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate some general fund dollars
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
this is the section one that you see
 
00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:55.109 align:start position:0%
this is the section one that you see
lines

00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh one through eleven of that nineteen
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
four million dollars would be for
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
highway block grant
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh under apportionment a highway block
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
grants to cities and towns
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
five million dollars would be a transfer
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the highway and bridge betterment
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
fund that dot uh runs
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
six million dollars would be for dot to
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh acquire fleet vehicles
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
and equipment and four million dollars
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
would be appropriated for winter
 
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:25.030 align:start position:0%
would be appropriated for winter
maintenance

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
i can continue if unless there's any
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
questions well go ahead we'll ask the
 
00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
questions well go ahead we'll ask the
questions

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay am i am i silent no no i will ask
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll ask the questions at the end
 
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.710 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll ask the questions at the end
okay

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh section two of this bill is relative
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
to school building aid
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that starts on line 12 of this
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment rather
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
so in total in total there's um
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
a 17 million dollars 17.3
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
in the first year and 10.6 in the second
 
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.430 align:start position:0%
in the first year and 10.6 in the second
year

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
and if we jump down to lines 17 through
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
24 you will see
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
what the purpose is so of that amount
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars in fiscal 22
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
would go towards accelerating some of
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
those tail payments so
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is essentially an effort to pay
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
down some of that outstanding obligation
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
that the state has up through i think
 
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
that the state has up through i think
fiscal

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
2042 so
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
districts that have projects on their
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
routine payment schedule under this
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
an expedited portion prorated across all
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
the projects by the department in the
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
amount of eight million dollars total
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then in uh sub paragraph b on line
 
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
and then in uh sub paragraph b on line
22

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
there's 9 million 278 000 in fiscal 20
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh two and 10 million 558 000 of fiscal
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
23 for new school building aid projects
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
these appropriations would be from the
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
as you know the school building aid
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
program now we do budget that
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph or paragraph roman 3 on
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
as you all know there is a cap
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
on school building eight expenditures of
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars per year
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
with this new infusion of dollars into
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
these payments
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think because of timing it's probably
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
probable doe
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
could be up against that cap so what
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
this does is it suspends that provision
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
just for the biennium to allow
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh doe to be able to make payments
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
without being uh non-compliant with that
 
00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
without being uh non-compliant with that
law

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
the net of all these actions and the
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
actions previously taken to approve some
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriations from from
 
00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:37.270 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriations from from
yesterday

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
section 3 on line 28 is the education
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund to cover
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
all the appropriations
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
from before as well as essentially the
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
dot portion of the appropriations today
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
so the amendment we had approved before
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
zero nine eight nine h had a transfer of
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
12 million in the first year and 10.7 in
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
this would be 27.5 in the first year and
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay are there any
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
i will add the net impact of all this
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund is
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh it would essentially balance to zero
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
it would be balanced
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
to the penny there'd be no additional
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
surplus in the education
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund or deficit at the end of
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you madam
 
00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you madam
chair

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
you know i have to say all the things
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
that relate to building aid
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the cap i i can agree with all that
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i i just love to see more money
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
going into building it
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
what bothers me is taking money from the
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
um and sending it to the department of
 
00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
um and sending it to the department of
transportation

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
for all things that i would love to see
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
added by the way
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm struggling a lot with this
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
because yes indeed d.o.t needs help
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
um really desperately but i just am
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it's a different
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
utilization of the other dollars because
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
they're going for an educational purpose
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
and when we took money
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
um out of the the amendment and we sent
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
the university system we took we
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
transferred money from the trust to the
 
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
transferred money from the trust to the
um

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
general fund uh we sent it to the
 
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.829 align:start position:0%
general fund uh we sent it to the
university

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
and to the community colleges to level
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
fund them we also paid for
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
running start which is near and dear to
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
both of our hearts
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
but my big big concern is taking money
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust and sending
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
it to the department of transportation
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
so can you somebody talk to me
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
about that and and make me feel better
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
about that change because it does
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
disturb me greatly because
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid that it's going to set a
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
precedent that we don't want to do
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay if i can i think we all realize
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
the highway fund is in big time trouble
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
okay and the
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
items that are in this particular bill
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
number one affect the city's accounts
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
you all know
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
that we had to reduce
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
the highway block grant because
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
not available in in the from the gas tax
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
also i believe commissioner
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
shaheen said that
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
the betterment would be
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
reduced because of the lack of
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
the gas tax and
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
we have talked about not having
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
money for the equipment and
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so i understand where you're coming
 
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
um so i understand where you're coming
from

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative heath but
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
i also feel that
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
although this money is all in the
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
that the needs of the department of
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah the needs of the highway fund
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
are such that it only makes sense
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
to provide that money um
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
for for the needs of the state
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um i i know i understand where
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're coming from
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh but i also think that um
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
19 million i think it was the figure
 
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.710 align:start position:0%
19 million i think it was the figure
from

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
for d.o.t that
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
we have in many ways
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
with the other what what i've proposed
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
with the other funding
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
have significantly helped the
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the education of our you know the
 
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
um the education of our you know the
education

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
side of it with the um school building
 
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:24.790 align:start position:0%
side of it with the um school building
aid

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
i know that that is a a huge
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
issue and i also felt that by paying
 
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
issue and i also felt that by paying
down

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
the money that doe owes
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
would allow us in the next biennium
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know not this year but in the next
 
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
you know not this year but in the next
biennium

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
to have um extra dollars
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
to provide to building aid
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i know that i know that there's
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of conflict between building aid
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay and transportation
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
so if we simply put this
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
um 19 million
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
into building aid in addition to
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
the um money that we have
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
that has been appropriated through this
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think that overall for the state
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
that when we are looking at um
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
the best use of the dollars at this time
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay i may not feel that way
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
in two years but at this time
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
i feel that it is just so important
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we are able to
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
help out the highway fund
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
and continue to provide the things that
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
are are so necessary not only for the
 
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.309 align:start position:0%
are are so necessary not only for the
towns

00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
but also for the state and i know we had
 
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
but also for the state and i know we had
talked

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
talked
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
yesterday about um
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
trying to move some money for equipment
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
over to the um the highway fund
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh out of the education trust fund so
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a new concept i'll put it that
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
way so
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where where i'm coming
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.829 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where where i'm coming
from

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
and why i made these recommendations
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
um i just i i am just
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
so concerned about the highway fund
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
i really really am and that this was
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
the only way that i knew of to
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
help bolster the uh the highway fund
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my that's my pitch
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you man you're welcome
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yeah just a couple things
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
first i need to i guess
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
preemptively apologize to mickey because
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
i wasn't able to find the the
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendments and the packet that he sent
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
because it's it's this very faint blue
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
ink that says
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
down or show all amendments so it always
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
takes me forever to find that one i did
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
find them
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
so thank you for sending that out um a
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
concern i have is that this does not
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of the highway fund
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
um and so i
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
totally agree that transportation needs
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
help that you know and everything that
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
you've said
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
they need all that money but i just you
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
know have to
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
point out that this is not the solution
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
um and i wanted to ask um if anyone can
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
speak to and maybe mickey has
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
some idea of this going forward are
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
there any unintended consequences
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we that could be foreseen otherwise
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't be unintended
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
um but in having the education trust
 
00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
um but in having the education trust
fund

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
go to zero and the last thing i was
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
concerned i just
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
i would and i know we don't know this um
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
i am hopeful and
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
probably fairly optimistic that there
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
will be federal money that will help the
 
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
will be federal money that will help the
transportation

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and now you're shaking your head no
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
is that not do we not
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
oh i was hoping that there may be
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds i'll let you speak to that
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
but those are my concerns about this but
 
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
but those are my concerns about this but
i

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
am always all for helping out
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
transportation as much as we possibly
 
00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:29.589 align:start position:0%
transportation as much as we possibly
can

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
i do have a little anxiety about the
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead mickey say as far as far as the
 
00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:41.190 align:start position:0%
go ahead mickey say as far as far as the
education

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
trust funds uh position at the end of a
 
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.309 align:start position:0%
trust funds uh position at the end of a
year

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
or biennium there is a law
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
that allows for um the general fund to
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
kick in
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
any deficit the education trust fund may
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
be in to finish a year
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
so as far as making adequacy payments
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's an open warranton statute for
 
00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
there's an open warranton statute for
that

00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
and the general fund would make an
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
automatic transfer to the education
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund should it
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
run a deficit um those who have been
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
around for a while
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
recall for many years we had tens of
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
millions if not hundreds of millions of
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in some years of a deficit in
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund requiring a
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
support at the end of the year to bring
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
it back to a zero so um
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not uncommon to have a
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
budget plan
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
with an education trust fund balance to
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
be close to zero or in a lot of cases
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh matt you wanted to speak
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
hello yep you're there excellent thank
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman uh nikki
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
accurately covered most of what i wanted
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
to say the only thing i'll add is
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the federal money side there is a
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
very small portion out of the american
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
rescue plan that
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
may be eligible for revenue replacement
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting on guidance from the
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
u.s treasury to identify exactly how
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
we might be able to deploy those dollars
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
for transportation
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that we can at all it
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
is a very small sliver
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
of that total package so i don't have an
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
estimate just yet because again we're
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
still waiting on guidance but
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
that would be the only set of flexible
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
money in the new federal bill
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
that could even be considered for this
 
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.589 align:start position:0%
that could even be considered for this
purpose

00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i also understand from what uh
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner sheehan said
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
that d.o.t itself
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
is not expecting any
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
um dollars to take care of
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
the uh issues that i
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
have covered in this uh particular
 
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.829 align:start position:0%
have covered in this uh particular
amendment

00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
i i would say that's definitely accurate
 
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
i i would say that's definitely accurate
um

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
i will say of course the feds did give
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
us 41 million dollars that we've already
 
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.390 align:start position:0%
us 41 million dollars that we've already
budgeted

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh in revenue replacement as part of the
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to that 8.1 million dollar
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
lapsed from a previous house bill
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
hb 1817 um
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that's all i would say is that we
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
have seen some some support we've
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
already kicked in
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
some general fund support to balance the
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
um but we have used almost all of the
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
resources at our disposal
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay did that answer your question
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much okay
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
are there other questions that we have
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing none
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a motion on amendment
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
1019h please
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
second thank you
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
um is there are is there any further
discussion

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative oh i'm sorry
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm really i have to say i'm
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
really really struggling with this
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
um i like everything we're doing
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
um but that said
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
i really don't like taking money out of
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
the trust to send to transportation
 
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.170 align:start position:0%
the trust to send to transportation
um

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:47.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.910 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
is there any money available from
 
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
is there any money available from
someplace

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
else that could go to d.o.t
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
no if i could just um clarify
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
something we've got we have another
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment after this one zero one eight
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
h which actually has a transfer going
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
so this amendment is going to transfer
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
money from the education trust fund and
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
spend it as general fund
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
that next amendment is going to transfer
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
general funds into
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and spend it as
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
after these two amendments are brought
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
up it can be the committee's
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
decision and give me the authority to
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
essentially blend those two transfers
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
together net them together
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day here these
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
two amendments are actually sending
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
general fund money into the education
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we could and then that way the
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
transfer from education trust them
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
associated with some of these spending
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
items i know that's kind of confusing
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking across two documents but
 
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.710 align:start position:0%
we're talking across two documents but
um

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
that is essentially what's happening if
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
if both of these amendments here today
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
one zero one eight and one zero one nine
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay does that answer your question mary
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative heath yes yes ma'am chia
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm still in a muddle to be honest
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
though um
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
i just don't know what to do because
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
this is a conundrum of of
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see these things take place
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm just not sure about the
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
so actually um
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
based on that um probably
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
we will go along with um this amendment
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
um but we'll continue to have a another
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
conversation after this
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%

have clarified at the beginning of that
 
00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
have clarified at the beginning of that
motion

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to do it all together
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
but since we didn't i would ask that you
 
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.670 align:start position:0%
but since we didn't i would ask that you
reconsider

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment 0989 h adopted yesterday
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
as that this amendment you just adopted
 
00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:42.950 align:start position:0%
as that this amendment you just adopted
would

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
essentially overwrite that so i just
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear the committee's
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we need to uh
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
i mean just as long as it's clear that
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
you're not going to adopt ultimately
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
zero nine eight nine h
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry was it representative heath is
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
you had a question um
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
you you wanted um questions being
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
addressed right now by mickey
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
to exactly what this amendment does
 
00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:22.470 align:start position:0%
to exactly what this amendment does
versus

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just did so what
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
are we undoing
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
so this if you recall the amendment we
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
just adopted
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
had um a transfer an education trust
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
fund transfer to
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
the general fund for the appropriations
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
we had already done that to pay for
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
previously adopted items that the
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee did
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't want two transfers that

here to find everything
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
okay does that take care of your
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
question tom
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine thank you okay
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendment 0989h
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
second thank you can i you know
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
can i'm i'm sorry can i just ask the
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
question i want to make sure that what
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
we're doing is correct if we
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
if if the idea would be that we would
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
vote not that we would vote no
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
and not consider amendm
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 0 9
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
8 9. then doesn't that mean that that
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we're leaving that amendment in
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
place shouldn't
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be voting yes yeah i think
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
technically you would yes to reconsider
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
it and then just ultimately not
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
adopt it again so i think i mean if you
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to follow
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedures here if you
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make a clear motion that
 
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.390 align:start position:0%
just want to make a clear motion that
you're

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
deleting section zero nine eight nine
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
from your recommended
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
amendments that works for me i just
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
needed to be clear that the idea was
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
that last amendment replaces the old one
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we adopted
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone's on the same page
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
with that with what's going on here i
 
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
with that with what's going on here i
hope

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
so why don't we why don't we try
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
what mickey said tell them in my motion
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay and that that works for me that
 
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
okay and that that works for me that
works

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%

uh yeah i know you've been gone for two
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
weeks so uh
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's all new it's all new it's like
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh going back to uh january
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
mickey we have two more amendments is
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
we do yes okay
 
01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
we do yes okay
um

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh okay that's the wrong one
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
see if i can summarize what
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh because it's the result what's
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
happening is is that we're spending the
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
same money in different ways
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct mickey between these two
 
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.789 align:start position:0%
is that correct mickey between these two
amendments

01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah uh close uh so the the one
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment relative to swept is around
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
the um the other amendment relative to
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
education funding is
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
closer to just over 140 million dollars
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
than that
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
impact of of that one so um but that's
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's they're both um
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
what essentially the way that they're
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
written to have a general fund impact
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
as the education trust fund to all the
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
decisions that we've made to this point
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is at a right
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
at zero so
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
um anything you would these two
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
amendments would essentially affect
 
01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:28.829 align:start position:0%
amendments would essentially affect
general

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative heath would you um
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
um so madam chair what i understand your
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to do
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
is it's going to transfer um into the
 
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
is it's going to transfer um into the
trust

01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
um 100 million dollars and
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that money would be used to indeed
 
01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:58.950 align:start position:0%
um put
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
um put
[Music]

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
toward reducing the
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
overall statewide property tax on
 
01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:10.549 align:start position:0%
overall statewide property tax on
education

01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment that i am proposing
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
and and i have a number of questions
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
that would go with that but let me let
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
me talk to my amendment my amendment
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
as it would be h basically what's in hb
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
623 and what 623
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
does at a critically important time
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
in our our our situation that we're in
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
it returns funding levels to that
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
which school districts received in
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
the 2021 second year of the biennium
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it um includes
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
disparity aid and some of the targeted
 
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.549 align:start position:0%
disparity aid and some of the targeted
aid

01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we sent to school districts and um
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
i really think that this is critically
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
important to our school districts
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
because the reduction in in prop up to
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
statewide property taxes
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know what does this mean for a
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
community like berlin
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
and cutting swept simply ultimately
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
really puts a further burden on all the
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
other towns that don't
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
retain their their swept funds like some
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the others and that difference has to
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
be made up
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately so while i i totally agree
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
with the concept
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
of reducing statewide property taxes
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
um i can't i i can't in good heart
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
um knowing that there is this much money
 
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:37.109 align:start position:0%
um knowing that there is this much money
available

01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
deny the school districts that so
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
desperately they need
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
these funds so what i'm proposing and
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
you have um uh jeff mcclinch put
 
01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:46.950 align:start position:0%
you have um uh jeff mcclinch put
together

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
a funding chart and you will see with
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
623 on that chart that you received this
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
morning from mickey
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of money utilizing 623 that
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
each school district across our state
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt 623 and and i think
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
that um we saw in in the report
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
from the the state of the school funding
 
01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:13.430 align:start position:0%
from the the state of the school funding
commission

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the importance of really sending money
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
to those districts that need it so
 
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.470 align:start position:0%
to those districts that need it so
desperately

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
desperately
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
why we are as a state spending enormous
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
amounts of money
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
on education those school districts
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
that can least afford it are struggling
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
the most with their property taxes
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i think in what you're trying to do
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
is you're trying to overall reduce
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
statewide property taxes
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
when in fact if we were to adopt 623
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a win-win situation
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
we would in fact be providing greater
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
dollars to those school districts most
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
in need
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
and at the same time the other
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
communities would also be receiving
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
funds and we would do nothing
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
to um compromise their additional swept
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
money that most
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
many of those communities um that are so
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
well off
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh continue to keep so with that madam
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
chair i put forward the amendment that
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
we have this morning and that amendment
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
is number
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
zero seven two one h and i thank you for
 
01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
zero seven two one h and i thank you for
consideration

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i hope the committee as a whole will
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
consider this what it can do
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
for our entire state and every single
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
school district across our state
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
considering what everyone has gone
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
through with the pandemic
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
the numbers um what this also will do
 
01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
the numbers um what this also will do
will

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
it will increase school district
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers free and reduced as
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
well as numbers
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that will um take it back to what the
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
numbers were
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
previously so we see a lot of things
 
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
previously so we see a lot of things
happening

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
in this amendment as a result um
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
of us my asking you to consider this
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i thank you madam chair
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath are there
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative yes can i just
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a question
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
am i understanding correctly
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
that the read that the reason
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
that a school district in
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
without this amendment that the reason
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
that a school district
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
might not receive an amount that was the
 
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
might not receive an amount that was the
equivalent

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
of what it received in the um
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the prior year is that there's been
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the number of students
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
in the school district is that is that
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
correct yes right and
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
and so if i'm
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
if and am i correct that that there may
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
be a whole bunch of reasons for the
 
01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
be a whole bunch of reasons for the
reduction

01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh presumably to the extent that the
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
reason was
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
um uh has something to do with covid
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
by the time that this uh budget
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
is uh in effect that
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
should i would think largely be over
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that so that those
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
students would return
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
unless those students have decided based
 
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
unless those students have decided based
upon

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the the public schools
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
the manner in which the public schools
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
have dealt with covet that they're no
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
longer satisfied with the public schools
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
that have decided to go
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
and have decided to go to private
 
01:09:47.199 --> 01:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
and have decided to go to private
schools

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i had a call and i need
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
to answer it
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
um i think the answer to
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
all of your questions uh represent lynn
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not sure i didn't need to
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
interrupt i apologize no no that's fine
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
within the uh formula right now
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
we have the um stabilization
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
grant which um
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
did you get it which normally again yeah
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
the providing dollars
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
for student enrollment
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the past i think that's how
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
i can explain that it may not be
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody may have a better explanation
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
than that but
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
there are dollars in there for that
 
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
there are dollars in there for that
quote-unquote

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization um requirement
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and that helps in many cases
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh towns like berlin
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
that lost um
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of students when they
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
lost the paper mill and any number of
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
other things and so
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
that was why the stabilization grant was
 
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
that was why the stabilization grant was
there

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
um representative lynn's comments and
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
also um just to talk a little bit about
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
what was done
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the lost biennium in terms of funding
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
for school districts
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think due to the covid pandemic and
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
the um urgency for for children to stay
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
at home
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes in fact a lot of children did not
 
01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:55.270 align:start position:0%
yes in fact a lot of children did not
appear

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
appear
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
on the rolls um however we're starting
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
the children come back in fact a lot of
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
children did go
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
to non-public schools they went to
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
private schools because many private
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
schools did stay
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
open but at the same time school
 
01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:10.950 align:start position:0%
open but at the same time school
districts

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
are right now as we speak being forced
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do their individual school district
 
01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
to do their individual school district
budgets

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
based on numbers that are significant
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
lower low much lower than the previous
 
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
lower low much lower than the previous
years

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
so it's what we're seeing and
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
actually sb 135 which
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative hennessey brought forward
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
begins to address that but it does not
 
01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
begins to address that but it does not
include

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
in her in her uh bill um
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
the elements that that we see
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the funding year of 2021
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the disparity date and some of the
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
targeted aid which we believe at this
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
is the most critical need across our
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
state for school funding
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
so with that i just really want to
 
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.669 align:start position:0%
so with that i just really want to
impress

01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
impress
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and again i urge you to look at the
 
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
and again i urge you to look at the
printout

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
printout
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
or look at the numbers for your school
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
district particularly
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
that mickey did send out that was put
 
01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
that mickey did send out that was put
together

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
by um uh representative uh
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
not reverend uh by jeff mc lynch um from
 
01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
not reverend uh by jeff mc lynch um from
his

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
organization i also want to say that
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
this morning in house ed
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um they are hearing sb 135
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that this is very much
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the conversation to bring those
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
up um and to in fact make school
 
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
up um and to in fact make school
districts

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
harmless from the just
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
myriad of issues that covet covet has
 
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
myriad of issues that covet covet has
had

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
on school districts in relation to
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
personnel in relation to
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
technology needs and i get it i agree
 
01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
technology needs and i get it i agree
wholeheartedly

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
that there are federal dollars large
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
federal dollars coming into
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
school districts but that said that does
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
not mitigate the issue
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
of the conversation going on right now
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
in every school district
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
um about the increase in or d
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
significantly decrease enrollments and
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
that needs to school districts need to
 
01:15:15.199 --> 01:15:16.229 align:start position:0%
that needs to school districts need to
know

01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
what the impact on their property taxes
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
and based on where we are in time right
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
this minute
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
school districts are struggling as will
 
01:15:27.679 --> 01:15:28.229 align:start position:0%
school districts are struggling as will
be

01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with the results of that
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
money and i do not believe that
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
the proposal that's going to be coming
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars to reduce the
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
statewide property taxes
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
will ameliorate the really impact of
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
currently the current situation
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
across our state with school districts
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
and their budgets and having to deal
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
with ultimately
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
is is kind of a crisis immediately
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i thank you madam chair and i thank
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
you representative lynn
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
can't hear you
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
am i no it's me the
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of your bill is
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
roughly 44 million dollars more
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
than 100 million
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
so how are you recommending
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i know there's nothing in here how
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
how are you recommending that
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
be reduced to the hundred million or are
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
you suggesting
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we put the whole 144 million
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
in thank you madam chair
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
that also was part of my reluctance on
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
voting yes
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
on the um amendment that we just had
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
because basically
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
that would have funded the increase to
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
623 that i was hoping to do
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
and and really make school districts
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
whole and and
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
bring back that level of funding to the
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
level that we provided
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
for school districts in 21 so
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't know exactly where the
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
additional funding would come from
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
but i believe revenues are coming in
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
stronger than we had anticipated
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of possible
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities that may present
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
themselves so this money will come in
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so with that said i would um
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
i would end my testimony there thank you
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's all right uh representative
 
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.229 align:start position:0%
okay that's all right uh representative
murray

01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair um i've
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
been sitting here and i mean both
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues are extremely important and so
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking in my head
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
is trying to suss out um you know
 
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.470 align:start position:0%
is trying to suss out um you know
basically

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
where's the greater good uh they're both
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
good what
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
where's the balance in terms of um how
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
this will have
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know where where would the better
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
effect be and i lean
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
towards um representative heath's
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment because of how it addresses
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
the specific issue
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
in the school and as schools are made
 
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
in the school and as schools are made
whole

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
then that provides relief to all the
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
communities as well with regards to
 
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.709 align:start position:0%
communities as well with regards to
swept

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
swept
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
so i guess just you know i'm looking at
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to figure
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
out the greater good the best way to go
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
think i right this point i have to
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
support uh representative heath's
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other comments
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay um the concern that i have
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and you have
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
identified it is that
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the last budget
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
you increased the amount of money
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
to school districts and so
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
in their adequate education
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
that we end up in the same situation
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium that if we provide
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
additional dollars in adequacy at this
 
01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.630 align:start position:0%
additional dollars in adequacy at this
time

01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
we will then have to go we will we will
 
01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:50.070 align:start position:0%
we will then have to go we will we will
hear

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing coming back 4
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
even though in your hb2
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
last year you indicated that this was
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
even if we identify this
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
as one-time money the expectation
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be that it will be there
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
going forward and
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
we should be spending one one-time
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
money to set ourselves up
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the same argument
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
every two years and that's that's one of
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
why i brought in the amendment
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
to lower sweat because that
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
affects every every single
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
person that pays taxes
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
rather than adding
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
an expectation to the school districts
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we may or may not be able
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
to uh fund in the future and that's
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that um
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know we in 21 21 and 22
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
we had extra money we put it into
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
the into the system and now they expect
 
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
the into the system and now they expect
it

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that's where that's where my problem
 
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.709 align:start position:0%
and that's where that's where my problem
is

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
so i am not in favor of
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
increasing expectations
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the school districts
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh over over time if
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
we can you know
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
if if uh if the revenue comes in
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're in a in a position in the
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
next budget
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
to bring 623 forward
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever else because we've got
 
01:22:10.239 --> 01:22:11.430 align:start position:0%
or whatever else because we've got
several

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
several
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
study committees going on right now
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
on or they will be going on i know the
 
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.310 align:start position:0%
on or they will be going on i know the
one

01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
was completed but i believe there's
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislation out there to
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
create another study committee so okay
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's i so i i cannot support this
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath and i'm very
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
sorry about that but
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray did you have
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
some comments
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question because if it's
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
um and being new i'm not always sure
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
could we prorate that hundred thousand
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to the school districts
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know as it's part of the 623 they
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
can't get all the amount we don't have
 
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
can't get all the amount we don't have
that

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
but can we prorate it so that the school
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do you want to answer that
 
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.350 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do you want to answer that
question

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have an amendment that does
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that i mean we could
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
certainly craft
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know work on a way to infuse 100
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars even or pick a number
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
into the education funding formula um
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's not something we've
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
we've done to this point or have
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
anything prepared but just like any
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
idea you know certainly we could we
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
could work on something and
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative heath well thank you
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i just want to go to your proposal
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
and just my big concern is cutting swept
 
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
and just my big concern is cutting swept
simply

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
shifts further the burden into local
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
where where towns and communities least
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
can afford it um i have to say that that
 
01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:56.149 align:start position:0%
can afford it um i have to say that that
representatives

01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
um murray's idea is one
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
that certainly has um a good
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
option and and um we could think about
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
what an amendment would look like
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would in fact increase the adequacy
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
amount for all school districts but also
 
01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.189 align:start position:0%
amount for all school districts but also
um

01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
reducing somewhat the um disparity aid
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the um uh the other um
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
funding the targeted funding that we put
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
out so we would just
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
proportion it out and i would ask
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
that maybe we have time to
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
um step back and put an amendment like
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
that together
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that in fact we would move we would
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
have time
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
to look at that as a whole with the
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
amount that with that hundred million
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly i don't i think
 
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.229 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly i don't i think
the

01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
100 million going into swept
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't mitigate the issues it doesn't
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
talk to the enrollment issues it doesn't
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
talk to so many
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the the crisis issues that our school
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
districts are facing right now
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i wish that we could compromise
 
01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
so i wish that we could compromise
together

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
utilizing the funding that's available
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
and look at a better amendment that we
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
could come forward with
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a win-win for our school
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
districts across the state
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
hampshire

01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none um
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
let me get my brain together um we have
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have two competing ideas
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
about what to do with this money
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
suggest that we vote on this
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then if this passes
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
we can uh bring in an amendment
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
and reconsider this okay
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
and um that way
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know we can do that
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or i guess or later today i
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if that can
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
that amendment can be uh completed
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%

vicky is that too much to ask
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i would just need to be clear on what
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking for for an amendment are
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
you looking for just a straight
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
proration of
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment so
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
essentially total education grants to
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
each municipality shall not be less but
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
then apply some sort of a
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar statewide cap that
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
doe would apply
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
pro rata across all town like i just
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
need some
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
direction as far as where to go with
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
with how you're
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
how you conceptualize capping it at 100
 
01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.669 align:start position:0%
how you conceptualize capping it at 100
million

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
that was my initial idea what you just
 
01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.149 align:start position:0%
that was my initial idea what you just
expressed

01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
i am open to suggestions if there is a
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative heath madam chair yes
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
um i would like to go ahead um with the
 
01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:27.189 align:start position:0%
um i would like to go ahead um with the
understanding

01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
that that we're going to go forward with
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
another amendment because what 623 does
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
is it changes it does a lot of things
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the enrollment numbers
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
free reduced lunch for those numbers
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like a little simple amendment
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
but a lot happens in it
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
so if we could accept this amendment
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
with the understanding
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
that we'll come back to take the
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
elements of 623
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
um and and mickey knows this well um and
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
then created amendment will
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
um amend this amendment and come back
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
with the second amendment that stays
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
within the hundred million dollars
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
but in fact makes the school all school
 
01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:07.430 align:start position:0%
but in fact makes the school all school
districts

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
whole um based on um
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
the elements of 623
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is which is not whole but an
 
01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
which is which is not whole but an
increase

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay i mean it's it's not a question
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
of whole
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
we can't say that it's a question of uh
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
of 144 million dollar increase
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%

and i think we should wait and see what
 
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.310 align:start position:0%
and i think we should wait and see what
uh

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
we have for revenue at the end of april
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have a better idea
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%

01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%

uh represents sorry representative heath
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%

vote on today
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so from from my perspective
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we we can vote on the amendment
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
these two amendments and if they pass
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
then they pass and the and if
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
if there needs to be amendments made
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
if they pass and there needs to be

amendments made
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative lynn votes no
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think i got my toggles backwards
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative murray votes yes and
 
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
representative murray votes yes and
representative

01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative umberger votes no
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right madam chair it's a vote of
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
four to three um
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
so we are now back to
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
defeated so uh
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
one zero one eight if we could bring
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
that up
 
01:35:08.159 --> 01:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
that up
please

01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think andrea has that up there for us
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
so just so everyone understands we we
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
discussed this amendment as to what's
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
going on but
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 23 state fiscal year
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
collections for the statewide education
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment would require that the
 
01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.669 align:start position:0%
this amendment would require that the
dra

01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
set the tax rate at an amount to
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
raise 263 million dollars versus 300
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is per the
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
statutory level essentially what this
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
would do is result in 100 million
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
dollars less
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
in swept revenue statewide education
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund in fiscal 23
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and then if you look down to section 2
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill on line 8
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
there is a 100 million dollar
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the general fund to
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund essentially
 
01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.830 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund essentially
netting

01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
netting
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh to zero between these two actions as
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
far as impact on the education trust
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions on this
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative heath chair i just want
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
to reiterate my concerns
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that cutting swept simply
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
shifts the burden
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
into local property taxes in those towns
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
and cities that can least afford it
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
in addition it does nothing to um look
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
at the enrollment numbers and the
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
difficulties that school districts have
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
i would fervently ask you to vote no
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
on this amendment so that we can come
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
back with another amendment
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
based on our previous conversation thank
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yeah i uh
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just want to
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
make sure so
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
what this would do would reduce the
 
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.350 align:start position:0%
what this would do would reduce the
education

01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
property tax and make up for that money
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
from the general fund is that correct
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay hey thank you very
 
01:37:15.679 --> 01:37:16.390 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay hey thank you very
much

01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not we're not taking any
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
money out of
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
sweat or just replacing
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
the reduction in taxes across the state
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
property tax payers
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative murray so is this
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
just for this year or this i guess this
 
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
just for this year or this i guess this
biennium

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
um so presumably in the next biennium
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
the swept would go back to where it is
 
01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
the swept would go back to where it is
now

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay let me just say this swept
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
in 23 will be
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
we will collect from the taxpayers
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
the 263.
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
we will replace the 100 million
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh that isn't there with general funds
 
01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
uh that isn't there with general funds
money

01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no change in how much
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
money will be uh provided by
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
swep to fund adequate education
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
that number of 363 stays there
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's just the method of how we
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
pay for it right follow-up certainly
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
so presumably because
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're putting 100 million into this fund
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
people would likely expect that their
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
so when we come to the point where we
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't put in the 100 million again
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
then we might expect the swept fund the
 
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
then we might expect the swept fund the
swept

01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
swept
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
rate to go back up to what it was in
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
generate the 363. so this is
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
um an event for this biennium but it's
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an event going forward
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's that's that's correct
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's correct it's a one it's one off
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a one time
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you right and that would be the
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
with um representative he's
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that it would be a
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
one-off because we don't
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
well who knows but we can't
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can't promise the future as you know
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i wish i could but we can't
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's um that's one of my
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
major concerns with uh representative
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
heath's amendment
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
is that we are setting people up
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
trying thinking that we are shorting
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
them in the future
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative heath with that said
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
i i really ask the
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to think about
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
for local school districts trying to
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
establish their budget
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
this would mean they would know how much
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
money would be forthcoming
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
it would be a bigger
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
advantage to those school districts
 
01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.550 align:start position:0%
advantage to those school districts
across

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
our state that are struggling
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
with coming up with significant dollars
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
to in fact pay their local property
 
01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.350 align:start position:0%
to in fact pay their local property
taxes

01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
and it just it it doesn't do for our
 
01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
and it just it it doesn't do for our
schools

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
what we need to have done we don't
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
change the numbers
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
we don't address the enrollment numbers
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
um so i again i would ask
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote no on this
 
01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote no on this
amendment

01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can come back this afternoon
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
with another amendment
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that uses the hundred million dollars to
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
really address
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
fully and i believe in a better way
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
again swept will
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
impact some of the most wealthy towns
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
people are used to paying
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
the prop the statewide property taxes we
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
end up
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
hurting those districts that lease can
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%

who's uh
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
wants to talk and i think we all know
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
what this says
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
so if you don't mind oh absolutely
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative lynn you have
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
your hand raised
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes i uh thank you so i just want to
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding um in light of what
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
had said if if we
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
approve this amendment
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
it does not result in any lower funding
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
of monies going for education
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
it simply means that instead of the
 
01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
it simply means that instead of the
money

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the statewide education
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
property tax it will come
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
from other state revenue sources
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
which does not include the statewide
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
so that to the extent that most of that
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
of those other sources involve monies
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
from the business profits tax or the
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
it will mean that uh to quote some of
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
that i've heard talk about this it will
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
mean that out of state big out-of-state
 
01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:43.510 align:start position:0%
mean that out of state big out-of-state
corporations

01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
are paying more um
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
paying a bigger share of the cost of
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
education than the property taxpayers
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
are um unless i'm missing something that
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
seems to me to
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
um seems to me to be um what
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh what we're talking about and so i
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
guess i'm
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think i have a problem
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
mickey would you like to uh provide some
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can really get into a
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
whole lot of detail or thoughts on that
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
less of the pool of money for
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
funding education trust fund
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures comes from
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
directly from property tax receipts
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
i think his point is is on the right
 
01:44:38.159 --> 01:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
i think his point is is on the right
track

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
track
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
all right um i will agree
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i hope that everyone will nod their
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
head yes
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we will vote on one zero
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
one eight but we will
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
also allow
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss and
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
if that one passes then we would
 
01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.310 align:start position:0%
if that one passes then we would
reconsider

01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am cheer i mean if you know
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't thursday after thursday
 
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:10.950 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't thursday after thursday
morning

01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
that could be something that you would
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
do anyhow
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
and so since it's thursday morning
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
i uh i recognize that
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
we need to follow the same sort of
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
protocol that we have
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have another question um so
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
if we vote right now um chances are that
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
as a division
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to come back
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
