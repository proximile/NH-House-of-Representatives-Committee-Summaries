00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm terrible at
 
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 align:start position:0%
talking you would think I wouldn't be
 
00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.509 align:start position:0%
talking you would think I wouldn't be
but

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
I I get up there in in front of the
 
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 align:start position:0%
podium and my my my brain just just goes
 
00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's mine that's hyperlock yeah
 
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
totally toally I knew I was here for a
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
reason but
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:06:22.629 align:start position:0%
 
was

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry about my delay uh route
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
2029 was
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh we're going at a crawl turtle turtle
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
speed all right first up
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
1081 relative insurance payments to
 
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.909 align:start position:0%
1081 relative insurance payments to
ambulance

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
providers so I think I've done this
 
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
providers so I think I've done this
build

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.749 align:start position:0%
 
before

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh so um I guess first of all who's
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
have you had your nice little list
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday do we
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay and repres said gives your on
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so the issue comes down to um
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
is that the insurance companies are
 
00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.189 align:start position:0%
is that the insurance companies are
paying

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
the the patient rather than the
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance the ambulance companies and
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
the ambulance companies are
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
saying that well you know insurance
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
companies pay other providers that are
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in their networks why
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
are they picking on them and the upshot
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
being that the and I guess you know we
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
have if we understand the role of manage
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
care and the invention of Managed Care
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
was that the whole point is that that uh
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
they would insurance companies would
 
00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:02.869 align:start position:0%
they would insurance companies would
have

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
contracts with
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
providers and we dealt with the problem
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
obviously when it came
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists and theologists and
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
other other ones when it comes to the
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
hospital but that the hospital was in
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
the mix there in this case this is just
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
an ambulance um on its own um obviously
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
ambulances are very unique industry in
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
the sense that that they're they they're
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
247 but it any you know but they're
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
they're they're sitting around waiting
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
to get a call you know they're they're
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
not it's not like they get guaranteed
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
clients in business and that I assume
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why they don't sign
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
contracts uh because they don't get
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
enough money
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
for not doing any business so I guess
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
let's I'll hear from the subcommittees
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
and how how you guys feel about this
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
and how how you guys feel about this
bill

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.069 align:start position:0%
bill
you

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
you
want

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
so Vincent's on this one too how did he
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
get yeah how did Vincent get on two of
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
sense I up for vinc I know but how dides
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
he get on I thought he yesterday he was
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
on liquor yesterday and then how did he
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
get me into didn't I switch him around
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
you guys all made the news
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday you guys all made the news
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
yesterday you guys all made the news
yesterday

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
see

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
am

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
switch the one I show okay
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
right because I made that switch
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
between was going to we took he wanted
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
I so we well I guess I'll have to
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
replace beu because he's not here right
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
now mean if we're if we're going to end
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
up you know being 44 then obviously
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to want to go forward
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill but I don't know how
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody feels about it yeah obviously
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
just for the record the committee has
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
killed this bill multiple years and
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
simply because um they you know this is
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
contractual issue it's about getting a
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
contract so represent I thought that we
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so the so the question I have is it's
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
kind of like related to that if they if
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
the ambulances get the money does that
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
imply that they cannot also
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
Bill the insured
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
person because the money that they got
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
from for the from the insurance company
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
didn't cover even half of what it
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
actually cost to do it right is there a
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
a limit itation there as a result of
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
that ter from them doing the balance
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
billing right okay uh someone want to
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
question you would say okay yes you can
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
always balance bill right so that was
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
the one difference about this bill this
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation undiff from what we
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
did with the with those other
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
professions was that balance billing is
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
still in here that the only difference
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
being is that they want the check the
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
check to get mailed to them directly
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
rather than going through the patient
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I'll tell a little story
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
on this one so um one of my employees a
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
deer attacked it his truck and the
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company sent me the check well
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
the check is clearly way too low for
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost to repair it and
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
they said well you just hold on to that
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
check and then and then uh give it to
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
the whoever your auto body shop is and
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
then then but my deathly fear is if I
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
cast that check then I'm accepting that
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
payment and so it's uh kind of an
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
awkward situation so I would assume in
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens with these
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
patients that that if they they they get
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
that check in the mail they would know
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
not to cash it they would know to turn
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
it over because they certainly wouldn't
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
want to be in in a Jeopardy situation so
 
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.030 align:start position:0%
want to be in in a Jeopardy situation so
representative

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I've been in this
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
situation several times and the problem
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
was never one that the insurance company
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
didn't pay enough for the ambulance
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
company to accept it the problem was
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
simply that they said they sent it to me
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then um I had to figure out where to
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
send it and there was one instance when
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
the company changed ownership in between
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
when they had um taken me to the
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
hospital and when I sent them the check
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
so I sent the check to the wrong place
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
and they sent it back to me it was in
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
credible complication and for that
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
reason uh I strongly support this
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill okay um chairman my my
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the people were
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
getting the check and cashing it and
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
keeping the money and that's why the
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
insurance companies wanted to it to go
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
directly to the ambulances and for that
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
reason I would support this bill as well
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
no the insurance companies don't want to
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
go directly to the ambulance
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
right say that again
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
but okay so why you kind of have to come
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
up and speak to the microphone the
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
ambulan that directly and the patient
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
also and identif for the record my name
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
is Michelle heat and I'm the health and
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
polic health law and policy legal
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
council at the insurance department and
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
this issue has a very long and sorted
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
pth as representative hunt alluded to um
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
it's been a problem for many years this
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
issue of balance billing where a outof
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
network ambulance respond responds to
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
emergency situation provides the
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
transport and then the person's
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
insurance gets built because that
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider is out of network
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
there is no contractual relationship
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
between the insurer and the ambulance
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
provider the insurer pays what they
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
would consider to be a reasonable rate
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
for those services and because there's
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
no contractual
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
relationship between the parties they
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
send it to the person they have the
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
contract with with which is the
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
patient the reason um there is this
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
provision in law that says you can
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
provide it directly to the provider or
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
the patient is if it's in network you're
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
going to send it to the provider because
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
you have a contract with them if it's
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
out of network you send it to the
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
patient because the patient is the one
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
ultimately liable for these services
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
that were out of network and what's
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to happen is the ambulance
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
provider is going to build the patient
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
for the services they rendered the
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
patient is supposed to use that check
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
they got from the insurance department
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
to pay the provider now this is just one
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of the issue um currently ground
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
ambulance is the only service that in
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
emergency situations you can still
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
balance Bill the patient so if the
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
provider doesn't feel like the insurance
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
compan is paying enough for their
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
services they can then Bill the patient
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
for the amount that the insurer did not
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
cover that is the bigger issue that
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
still needs to be addressed here this
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written right now is
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
only making it so that the provider will
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
receive payment directly from the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
insurer that they do not have a
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship with um over
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
the summer and fall the insurance
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
department recognizing that that's is
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
still a major issue for consumers and a
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
major issue in the insurance industry we
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
um convened a state colder group
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
together to try to address some of these
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
issues and if you'll give me a second I
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
can give you a quick recap of what we
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
talked about in that so for this work
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
group we were specific specifically
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
focused on the role of commercial health
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
insurance when considering the overall
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
funding of ambulance services we want to
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
address the problem of surprise billing
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
the balance billing to the patient as
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
well as the problem of establishing a
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
more rational stable Equitable funding
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism for ambulance services and the
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
role of commercial Health insurers in
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that system we also were looking at the
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
problem of the inefficiencies in the
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
current system and an opportunity to
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
improve Service delivery models everyone
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
agreed that ambulance providers are
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
vital to emergency responsing
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
communities and an integral part of the
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
Healthcare System we were able to
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
identify some common ground on a number
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
of issues there was agreement that
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers need adequate
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
funding to ensure they can provide
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
necessary Services when called upon
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
there was also agreement that the
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
current emergency transport system is
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
inefficient and that a better that
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
better delivery models ought to be
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
available although there's very little
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
support for the idea of um continuing
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
surprise ambulance building
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers are generally
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
loathed to tackle that issue in
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
isolation without also solving the
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
overall problem of how best to Fund
 
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
overall problem of how best to Fund
emergency

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
services the overarching policy issue
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
that prevents stakeholders from reaching
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
any further consensus is whether the
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
funding of these Services where the
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
funding of for these Services should
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
come from some argue that communities
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
should decide what emergency services
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
will be available in their community and
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
that is appropriate for communities to
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
cover any funding gaps with public funds
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
others argue that commercial insurance
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
Market should be paying an amount
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
adequate to cover the cost of providing
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
services that are not covered by
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid it is important to
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
note that only about 20% of all
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
transports involve commercially insured
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
patients if commercial insurers are
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
required to pay significantly higher
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
fees to compensate for other payers like
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid not paying enough
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
then the cost of funding these Emergency
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
Services gets shifted to Consumers
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing commercial
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
insurance this philosophical divide
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
regarding who should be responsible for
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
funding emergency services in
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
communities is the major obstacle that
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
prevents stakeholders from working out
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
any further details about how to address
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
this important issue so that's a very
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
broad overview of that this issue is a
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
lot more complex than direct pay and
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is only meant to address that
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
one little issue and is not going to
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
address any of the other issues related
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
to this so
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
for those of us who have been in the
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
room with this issue over the years your
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
arm down for a
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
second the issue was always originally
 
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.390 align:start position:0%
second the issue was always originally
balance

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
billing people wanted to stop the
 
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.190 align:start position:0%
billing people wanted to stop the
balance

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
B the problem would be is if the check
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
goes directly to the
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
ambulance and then the ambulance company
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
bills the patient for the balance
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
billing the patient will say said no you
 
00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
billing the patient will say said no you
got

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
paid you're all
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
set so the simple compromise okay
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
because originally we had had it had to
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
be paid
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
direct issue was always balance
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
billing the compromise that we
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
originally put in the statute was that
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
it could
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
May well the simple answer would be is
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
that if the insurance company I mean if
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company wants to check
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
directly they can't balance
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill that would be the
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
compromise I
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
get I know I know I just threw threw the
 
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
bomb on the floor and I want everybody
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
to absorb what I just said okay now
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
represent of Gibs thank you yes I do
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
recall that we uh discussed this during
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing um and certainly the issue
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
of balance billing is an issue um but as
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
I tried to explain earlier
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
balance billing aside the current system
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
is harmful not only to the providers
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
which is what we've mostly been
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussing it's harmful to the patients
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
because the patients are put in this
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
incredible complication that is seems to
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
me to be completely
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and that's why I I really
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
think this this bill is necessary do you
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
understand what I just said I do okay so
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
the patient's not going to be
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and saying is why are
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
you balance billing me if you've already
 
00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
you balance billing me if you've already
been

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
paid the it this could be in the
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
statement couldn't
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
it when the balance billing comes in the
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company has to say yes we
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
were PID we did receive x amount of
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
money but it's not enough and we want
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
you to pay the difference the cost of
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the we got paid paid X the cost of the
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
service is actually is actually Y and
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's why we want you to pay Z now
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
that's not my favorite thing I would
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
rather not have that happen well but you
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
understand that you're talking about how
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is complicated for the for the
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
patient so don't you think it would be
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
the patient would say they would say no
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to pay you a balance I'm
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
not going to pay that extra charge
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
because you've already been
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
paid Well
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
it Well that's
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
is that comom that that problem doesn't
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
always occur I mean this has happened to
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
me three or four times and there was
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
never an issue of the insurance company
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
paying too little the provider was
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
always willing to accept the amount
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
provided by the insurance company the
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
problem was where do you send the money
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying to you I agree
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill if we add a sentence that
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
there would be no balance billing if the
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance company wants the check
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
directly it doesn't want to go through
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
if they want the tech
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
directly then they can't balance bill
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
then who is represent spear would
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
legislators get to speak first but when
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
when when we had uh when when we had the
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard uh
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that was literally scary to me
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
yes in conquered where the ambulance is
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
pretty close to the hospital and people
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
live close to the hospital that's fine
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you know the balance and you don't
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
probably don't need balance spilling
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know but Upstate where
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're traveling sometimes we we heard
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
stories of having to go out of state to
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
get people to a hospital I mean
 
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
get people to a hospital I mean
horrendous

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
horrendous
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
stories I don't know how B how you could
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
ever cut out balance billing for that
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation you know so I I cannot go
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
along with that so represent prelli yeah
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I have um a few questions so
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
would Medicare and Medicaid be
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
considered contracts so who you know you
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
know how does medicare and medicaid work
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
yeah Medicaid pays the provider directly
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand that some of the
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
providers are local municipalities so
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
does that bring another complication
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
into the mix and um I get build for out
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
of network providers all the time so I'm
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
not really sure why this would be I'm
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out I'm not sure
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
why this particular service would be so
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
much more egregious than any out of
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
network provider where I get a bill that
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
has the balance of what was what the
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
service was and what the insurance
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
company paid and what I'm responsible
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
for so I'm just trying to figure out
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
those issues and thank you for at least
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
trying to have the conversation but I
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
think a lot more work still needs to
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
happen and I hope you didn't say well we
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
tried and that's it we're we had a
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission we tried that's we're done I
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
hope you're continuing
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
we are open to continuing our work but
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
the issue's kind of at its stand still
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
where we have the all the stakeholders
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
and it's not just two sides it'd be more
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
like a circle and everyone's on the very
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
periphery and until they start moving a
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
little bit closer we're kind of at a
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
standstill so someone needs to give up
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
something there needs to be some kind of
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
negotiation on this issue for us to
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
continue um to get to your questions yes
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
it is the same for all outof Network
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
providers so the provisions in this bill
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
are not specific to ambulance it's for
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
all outof Network providers and it's the
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
same process for anyone as for respect
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
to billing billing works the same
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
whether you're your municipality or any
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
other kind of Provider you would send
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
the bill to The Entity responsible for
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
paying and then they pay the bill for
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid there are set
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
rates that are set by both of the
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
programs currently in New Hampshire um
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
last year there was legislation passed
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
that increased funding foric Medicaid So
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire it's the same
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
rate being paid for both Medicare and
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
Medicaid traditionally Medicaid had um
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
paid about half of what Medicare pays so
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
right now they're um
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
equal that payment that's set by those
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
programs is payment in full and if the
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
person is covered by those programs the
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
providers are not allowed to balance
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
situations and the other out of network
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
why don't you stay
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
there so any other out of I'm trying to
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
figure out what's the difference between
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and any other out of the
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
example I'll give is when you go to an
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
out of network doctor physician whatever
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
you don't leave without
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
paying right usually you don't get you
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
get a you I get a bill okay so they let
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
you out the door without because usually
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
I whenever I've been to an out of
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
network there's some typ of down they're
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
expecting payment a certain percentage
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
and then I get a bill for the rest did
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
right but at usually like you say when I
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
when I go to convenient MD or you know
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
some I they're going to charge me right
 
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.310 align:start position:0%
some I they're going to charge me right
up

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
front well I'm just saying any any yeah
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
normally when you're going out a network
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're probably different every they're
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
charging you before you before you go
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
home a certain percentage and then the
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
balance and that's what the issue is is
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
that they they don't carry a credit card
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
machine in the ambulance no I can't
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
understand so ever plan is a little bit
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
different some plans do cover out of
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
network services and that there could be
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
cost sharing associated with it most um
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
manage care plans exclude out of network
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
unless it's an emergency situation or um
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes Urgent Care could be included
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
in that the procedure for it is the same
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
though that the patient will be sent a
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill from that out of network provider
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
because the out of network provider
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
whether they're an ambulance a doctor or
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
a facility does does not have a
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship with the
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
insurer the patient then is responsible
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
for submitting it to the insurance if
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
you have any kind of out of network
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
benefit um if you don't have an out of
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
network benefit then you're likely going
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
to have to pay that full amount and the
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
patient is the one responsible for it
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
because it's excluded usually from your
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
policy that it's not going to be covered
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
but some policies do cover out of
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
policy okay other questions yes
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
represent BR um this isn't a question
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's a would you believe I mean I just
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
share representative porcelli's uh
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
frustration that you know we seem to
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
just and I I was on that commission for
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
one day um and then stepped off um I I
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
feel frustrated that we're kind of
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
saying oh well there's nothing we can do
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what the answer is
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
either but it's very
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
frustrating representative Gibbs thank
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
you uh this is also a comment it was
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
just said that this bill refers to all
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
out ofet Network providers but I have it
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
here right in front of me um and just
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
looked at it again it refers
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
specifically to ambulance providers not
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
all out of network providers she when
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
she says all it's not the bill it is
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that is the underlying statute that
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
does say that out of if you're out of
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
network right but this bill Deals Only
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
with ambulances that's correct you're
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
choosing just one industry right
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
now so anybody
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.870 align:start position:0%
now so anybody
else

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay we'll let the
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
so what's the difference if the patient
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
gets the
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
check then sends it in and we balance
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
build them that way they still got a a
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
chunk of money whether it went directly
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the am ambulance or whether it came
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
through the patient to the ambulance
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're still going to balance billum they
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
still know what's going to happen if you
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
really want to make balance billing go
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
away pay the whole bill have the
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay the whole bill
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we're charging them I still can't
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
really wrap my head around how an
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company gets to say now you
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
ask for 500 but we feel like we're only
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to pay you 300 cuz I know if my
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
oil company showed up put $500 of oil in
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
my tank and I said I don't really think
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
the oil's worth 500 I'm only going to
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
pay you 300 they're either going to come
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
and suck the oil out or send me to jail
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
so I still don't have can't figure out
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
how they get away with that because I
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
call that theft but that's just me
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
so they keep trying to use this to get
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
us in network we can't come in the
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
network we can't afford to be in their
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
Network we won't survive and then when
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
you down
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
911 nobody's coming or if they are
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
they're coming from a long way away so
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's the decision I guess that you
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
guys have to make whether we're coming
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
or not right but you're saying what's
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
the difference of where the who the
 
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
check gets mailed to so the question is
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the system
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
now they spend it and they don't pay the
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
ambulance they being the patient correct
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
so so so that you're you're thinking
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
that if you get the check ahead of time
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
they won't they won't spend your that
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
what the back build the B balance
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
billing we also run into that we get
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
calls all the time I got this what do I
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
do with it I don't know what where to
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
send this where's the address where do
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
where do I mail it so if anything it's
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
helping the patient es especially you
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
know just been through traumatic stuff
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
where do I send the bill where do I send
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
that check
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
right so it just makes it easier on the
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
patient How about if um when you deliver
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
that patient to wherever they're going
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
on you hand them a piece of paper right
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
then and there and said they can sign
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
off to have the bill the the check sent
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
directly to them direct to another way
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
have have we do do they have that waiver
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
now we do and they still send it to the
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
patient so they ignore the inter come
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
ignore that name okay well maybe that
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
compromise kind of all compromised out
 
00:32:36.679 --> 00:32:37.549 align:start position:0%
compromise kind of all compromised out
no

00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
no the compromise when you get we've
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
already been dealing with this issue how
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
many times how many times have you put
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in this is my first okay how
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
many times have you come into this
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
committee and supported the legislation
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
right couple of times couple why and
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's the question why do I have to
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
keep coming back this is pretty
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward okay representative
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
burrow would it be helpful if when the
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
check comes there's a big big uh piece
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
of paper and bold letters that says this
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
isn't yours you need to send it to the
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance company yeah I think the
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
insurance company's going to do that no
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
no no no no no that you they're not
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
telling you the truth the truth is you
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
build you let the customer the patient
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
know you have in their mailbox within a
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
week of the billing that they are going
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be receiving the
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
check you let them know this happening
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is evidently for
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs she needs to each
 
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
time it happens to call up and say I
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand your letter that says
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
by the way I'm going to balance bill you
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
based upon whatever you end up sending
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
whatever that check is Mr chairman I
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
received no such notice and by the way
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
the so no Ambulance Company ever mailed
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
you a notice that you might never and
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
I'm talking three or four what is wrong
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
with you ambulance companies Mr chairman
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
may I
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
continue thank you um just in reference
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
to conquered I once had an ambulance
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
take me a quarter mile and the bill was
 
00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:12.829 align:start position:0%
take me a quarter mile and the bill was
almost

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and again there was 900 and
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
something paid to me by the insurance
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
company and by the way in reference to
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
signing a piece of paper when they get
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
you to the hospital the last time I was
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
taken to the hospital was because I woke
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
up at 3:00 in the morning in
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
excruciating pain and I can assure
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
everyone that at that point I was not in
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
any shape to understand anything that I
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
might be asked to sign so I I I don't
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that that is really the the
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
solution I can't believe you were
 
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
charged of
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
$1,000 in the city of conquered uh I
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
I've been charged $1,000 in the city of
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
conquered several times the worst one
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
was when it was a quarter mile because I
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
was in my doctor's office um I had gone
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
to my doctor's office due to repeated
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
indigestion I'm sorry to make a long
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
story of this okay well here here's the
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
question real quick was it the City
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance or was it the the uh a private
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Company well that was that was
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
the change it changed from the city
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance to the private ambulance
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
company and both times they charge you a
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
thousand well they've charged me almost
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
a thousand every single time okay but
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
that quarter mile I was in my doctor's
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
office my doctor's office was a quarter
 
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
office my doctor's office was a quarter
mile

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
mile
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
from the hospital my doctor gave me a
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
test and she said I think you're having
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
a heart attack and I said okay I'll go
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
with the hospital and taxi she said you
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
can't go in a taxi you have to go in an
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance we calling an ambulance for me
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
so they called an ambulance the
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance took me a quarter mile I
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't feeling that bad I could have
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
walked uh but I got a bill for almost
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 I am not exaggerating got and
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
again I went through this craziness and
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
the current system is har harmful to the
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
patient okay representative
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
taxon before I get into my actual
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like to say to
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs if there is anyone
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
in this room who could walk a quarter of
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
a mile to a hospital while having a
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
heart attack I'm sure it would be
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
you I the thing of it was I was not
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
having a heart attack my doctor Mis
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstood something and I was fine I
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
was perfectly fine but the doctor said
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the hospital well
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
should that happen I'm sure you'll make
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
it um but I want to I have to put on my
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
I have to put on my selectman's hat in
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
the two towns that I represent I'm a
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
selectman in the town of
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
Troy and unfortunately in New Hampshire
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
when you become a selectman you learn
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
things that you never wanted to know and
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
the one of the big challenges that we
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
had is our Ambulance
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
Service and so the issue as a business
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
owner I look at the billing and say well
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
why don't you guys just send a bill and
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
then the answer we get back from the
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance service is what's going on
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
here they send the check to the patient
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
who spends it or when we when we send
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
them a bill they say they don't have it
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
anymore when you when you live in a
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
rural area when you live with people I
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
mean is there something murkier than
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
medical bill I can't imagine what that
 
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.630 align:start position:0%
medical bill I can't imagine what that
would

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
be so I have to say that well I would
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
like to think that people would be
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and say oh this is the check
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
for $900 from my insurance company
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to pay for my $1,000
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance ride the reality in the world
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
is the patient gets a check for a th
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
from 900 bucks from the insurance
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
company and that immediately goes to
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to spend their $900
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
on as a selectman as in a town that now
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
has we have a joint quasi
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer between
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
quasi joint operation in Troy and Fitz
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
William for the operations of our
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
ambulances which has been very
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
successful and we have not had to sign
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
on with chesher County's very
 
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.990 align:start position:0%
on with chesher County's very
expensive

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
unfunded uh ambulance program
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
but we still have the issue of billing
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
and in our case it's cheaper for the
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the two towns to subsidize
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
the short which is largely made up by
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
the the short is the Billings that we
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't get the money back on because they
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
sent the checks to the the
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
patients I'm I don't want to quote our
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
billing our what we actually our
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
collections rate because I understand it
 
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.069 align:start position:0%
collections rate because I understand it
has

00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
improved and the other thing that I
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
think you have have to consider is Mo
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
not over here in the big side of the
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
state but when you get into the rural
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
part of the state I'm sure up in Coos
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
County it's the same and I know what it
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
is in Cheshire county these are Quasi
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer projects operations it's Town
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
people and they don't want to be bill
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
collectors they don't want to Hound
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
their friends and neighbors who just had
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
a heart attack for a $400 check and when
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
you talk to the guys that run the
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance squads they'll tell you that's
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's like well yeah we know they got the
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
money and we know they owe it to us but
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
now I have to be a bill collector and
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what they signed on for they
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to save lives not collect
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
bills and you know I we as Selectmen we
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
have to deal with that we ultimately get
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
to be the bill
 
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.430 align:start position:0%
to be the bill
collectors

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
collectors
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
but so for those all of those wonderful
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
reasons on my part I really have to say
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is is a this is a big problem in
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
small towns the smaller the ambulance
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
service the bigger a problem this is and
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
I would have to support the bill to send
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
the checks directly to the ambulance
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
people and and I don't see why you can't
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill the patient for the deficiency if
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Bill's
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and the $900 check goes directly
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the ambulance Squad they can bill for
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
$100 and quite frankly if the people
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
can't pay it in all of the ambulance I'm
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
aware of they're going to write it off
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
anyway so the the balance billing is is
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to be mute because if you mail the
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
check directly to the ambulance the
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
patient won't pay the balance billing
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
anyways corre and so they're they're
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
still out the money so at least they're
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
getting the check but they're still
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
getting more money than they're the the
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
40% of the money that they're getting
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
now okay representative M uh thank you
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just again I do think that
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
that sending the the check to the to the
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
person is dumb we don't do that in other
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
types of medical care I don't go in and
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
have an operation for a knee replacement
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
and and and get a $10,000 check uh it's
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
paid directly and and there may be a
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
co-payment and then I pay that so I
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't see why this should be any
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
different I I think the bill makes sense
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
as our person from the insurance
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
department said it's it's not covering
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
the whole thing because there a lot of
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
different problems but I think it's a
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
step of the in the right direction it'll
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
get part of it covered so I I I support
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
this wholeheartedly thank you right well
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
representa M just pointed out to me that
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
the the problem is that the bank is
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
cashing the check in the first place
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
because the check does say payable to
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company and and but that
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're still cashing it that's no no
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's required by Statute in the current
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
law the ambulance it's supposed to say
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
the insurer and the ambulance service
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
provider so the for the patient to say
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
they don't know who why that other name
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
is on the
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
check the ones I got were payable to
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
Merill Gibbs how long ago was that a
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
couple years ago okay because this is
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
law this law has been on a book how long
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
we've had with the last time we did this
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
where we put in the uh the ambulance
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
come yeah I don't think they're coming
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
that way they're not coming that way so
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying they're violating the law
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
shocker isn't
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
violation I'll try and get you a cheuck
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
violation then we'll have to give it to
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service if it's
 
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.190 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service if it's
[Laughter]

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
true right uh representative Peli then
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative MCU so um first of all
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your Ambulance Service we
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think we all appreciate especially the
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer um services that we have when
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
we call 911 we definitely appreciate
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
someone coming and helping but I wanted
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
to understand why is it so difficult to
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
ensure why is it so difficult to sign a
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
contract with the insurance companies
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that it's too expensive
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
can you expound on that correct and then
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between private
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
ambulance and municipalities with the
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
contracts and then finally would uh
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay the difference if the
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
um Pro if the uh patient cannot
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
pay okay let me see if I can get all
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
three of those
 
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.349 align:start position:0%
three of those
so

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah no what was the first
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
one about you mentioned that it's too
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to sign so so if we take what
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
they offer cuz usually it's not just
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
$100 it's usually about mean signing a
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
contract but you mention it's too
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
complicated to sign contracts with
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
they're just not getting enough they're
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
not getting enough so if we sign the
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
contract we take what they give us and
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
Bill not because we want
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
to right it's a federal law so we we
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
can't get around that that it's it's the
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
law and and yes we lose money on those
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
patients right if you notice there's a
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
lot of doctors that don't take Medicare
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and Medicare patients anymore and that's
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
why because they lose money right so we
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't sign the contract because we don't
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
want to lose money again it's bad enough
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're losing it with the feds so we
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
can't bellance bill if we take that
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
contract that's why we don't take that
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
contract and you're next one next
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
question was yes I just I wanted to
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
understand so if the if the patient
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
cannot pay and it's a municipal so if
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
the patient does go back to the town how
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
does that work and and I can only tell
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
so if that patient has gotten has
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
received the
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
check has cashed the check hasn't sent
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
us the money but we know they receive
 
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.630 align:start position:0%
us the money but we know they receive
the

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
check we
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
will send them a bill three or four
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
times and and then maybe put them into
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
collections if they did not get a check
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
or they sent us a check and we send them
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
the balance Bill we will Bill them three
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
times and then the town writes it
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
off it's similar to what you're doing
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid or Medicare correct
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
so but we're trying to survive right and
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the difference between a private
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
ambulance in a
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
municipality if the private ambulance is
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
not doing emergency contracts and just
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
doing transfer work from One hospital to
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
the other the nurseing home to there
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
right those are pretty much scheduled
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
calls uh they know they're going to be
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
busy all day so even at that low rate
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
they're making up in
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
volume what we can't make up in volume
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
right so they do better in their volume
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
right where we sit around ready not just
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
sitting around but you know we're
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
working and ready to
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
respond but if we don't
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
get four five six seven calls that day
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
we're not making the volume right we may
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
only get one call that day and you've
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
paid a crew of two minimum to be 24
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
hours and now we have to
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
pay pretty substantial especially like
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
during the a lot of departments hire
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
people during the day
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
because the the volunteers of old aren't
 
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.150 align:start position:0%
because the the volunteers of old aren't
here

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
anymore right they're they're working
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to work in town
 
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
anymore they have to leave town so
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
they're not available for calls looks
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
like somebody had a early morning
 
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.270 align:start position:0%
like somebody had a early morning
call

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
no oh okay uh but so we end up having to
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
pay people now
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
because like I know in the town of eping
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
the people that would take these
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer jobs can't afford to live in
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
town anymore so we end up having to pay
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
247 so that's what we're trying to do
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
just staylo represent M thank you Mr
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
chairman so a few thoughts on this for
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
the committee um EMS has been my career
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
for a long time some of you already know
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
that private public volunteer whatever
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
and and the issue here is helping these
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
EMS Services be sustainable so they're
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
available for the most number of people
 
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
in the most solvent fashion and you know
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have had a chance to
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
do the right thing for a long time and
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
some do and some services are able to
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
sign a contract but some aren't and many
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
patients like representative Gibbs who
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
are very capable of getting themselves
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
to the hospital may feel compelled to
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
utilize those services and then get
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
stuck with the bill um point of fact is
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
you always have the ability to sign off
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
or sign a refusal as we call it you know
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the vernacular is is a refusal of
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
services but you very well maybe
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
pressured by your PCP or the providers
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
themselves to say well you know we're
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
not responsible for what happened
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
happens you could die in five minutes or
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
I mean you get the idea so a lot of
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
patients don't sign that refusal and of
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
course in that type of Life circumstance
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
don't read the fine print that says you
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
know where you sign consent to be
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
transported which I assure you that you
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
do like it has to be in every EMS run
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
sheet it's got to go into our state
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
system you've got to sign or it's
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
documented why you didn't sign like
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're unconscious or whatever and if
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
you're unconscious it's implied consent
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
so you're taken right so but you have to
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
give consent to transfer to transport
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
and when you do that you are absolutely
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
on the run sheet signing consent to be
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
buildt right similar to when I call um
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a bad analogy but it's close
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
if I call Portland Glass and say will
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
you remember we did the the windshield
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
bill bill here um and uh you know I call
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
Portland Glass and say you replace my
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
windshield they give me well Geico gave
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
me the option of sending the check to me
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
or sending it to my dealer well I didn't
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to have to handle that money didn't
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
know exactly what it was going to cost I
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
told Geico send it to the dealer as it
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
turns out they didn't they actually sent
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
it to me and the dealer G and said
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
where's our 3,000 bucks um and of course
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
I hadn't cashed it it was made out to
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
two parties I just signed it over and
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
gave it to them that doesn't always
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
happen um as representative PR has said
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
and he and I have been in the the EMS
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
service for about this well I've been 33
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
years you probably got a few years on me
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
couple so we see both sides of this
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
issue and I think now since 80 70 80% I
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't know the current number of EMS is
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
are provided by Volunteers in the
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
country and in our state now some of the
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
largest call volume areas in In fairness
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
right so if you can look at that 70 80%
 
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
number two ways the number of calls done
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
by volunteers and the number of Staff
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
right so some of the busier cities like
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashville conquered some
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
others are staffed by full-time folks
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
that have medical billing as part of
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
their service and they can go do the
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
collection plenty of towns just like
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative Faxton said don't want to
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
harass their neighbors they don't want
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
the town clerk to be in the billing
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
collections so they employ a billing or
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
collections which then takes a cut right
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
and that that makes makes it a less
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
valuable proposition so frankly we ought
 
00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:16.799 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill right and I'm I'm not
 
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:18.799 align:start position:0%
always on this side of this type of
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
thing representative hunt knows that
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why he kept looking to the
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
right and didn't want to call on
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.109 align:start position:0%
right and didn't want to call on
me

00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
but anyhow they all had something to
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
share anyways I think we ought to pass
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
it for those what we're GNA do is uh
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to p take any vote right
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
now um when I read the bill um and it
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
just CR crosses out check payable to the
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
insurer and the ambulance service
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
provider and then it goes on subject to
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions of the policy
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
plan or contract so since there is no
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
contract um I guess that means is that
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
the the insurance company would be up to
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
saying anything they want to say in the
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy and wouldn't you be
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
surprised that next year that they come
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
back and say something that you didn't
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
really want them to say in that policy
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
requirement because they might say in
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
the policy our policy is not to pay the
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh you know or something I
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
would like to see a copy of a check
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
recent check that did not have the
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
service provider the ambulance on the
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
check because I if there is a violation
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
in the insurance company are violating
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
the statute that we just passed I
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
realize this is hasn't been on the books
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
that long but I would like to know if
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
there's a violation going on but it
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding is I think we might need
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
to look at the the the finished part of
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
that sentence uh if you really want to
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
pass this bill okay
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you very
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%

myself okay is that any more more
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on um ought to pass on
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
12:36 seeing none all those in favor
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
raise your hand 1 2 3 four five six okay
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:23.789 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:53.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
right okay Department insurance
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
department is is this one that needs to
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
be reviewed it would be need to be rev
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
1296 do uh review and find out what the
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
under I'm sorry what's the question yeah
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
about uh well we have to do uh an impact
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
financial review a fiscal note yes we
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
are in the process of uh we had
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
initially submitted a fiscal note for
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
1296 um but in preparing for today we
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
realized that there was a mistake in it
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
so we're in the process of updating that
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note um the issue with this
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
bill is it's trying to mandate
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
um well it it's requiring the coverage
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
of Diagnostic and supplemental breast
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
examinations without cost sharing so
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
under the current system preventative
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
Services the just to be clear these are
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
all covered Services right but
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
preventative ones are with no cost
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
sharing currently you do have there is
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
some cost sharing that is allowed for um
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic and supplemental right so
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
to remove that there will be some fiscal
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
impact and we're in the process of
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
amending it to um kind of Peg down
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what that fiscal impact look
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
like right because it's Shifting the
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
cost from the patient to the insurer so
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the insur responsibility if it's under
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
the Medicare Medicare expansion would
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
that now
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
require U the state having to pay for
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
pay no this would not have any defrayal
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
implications okay so this is just we're
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
Now using what I call the Murphy Law
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
which is that which we usually would
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
hold the bill interim study the bill and
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
then we would do that financial analysis
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
but you think you're going to able to do
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
that in the F the fiscal note yes so
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
defil would only apply if this was a
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
service that's being added these are
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
already covered Services the only thing
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
that would be changing is that um there
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
would be no cost sharing for the patient
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
so um what whatever amount that patient
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
would normally have to pay under their
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
policy the insurer is now going to be
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
resp responsible for so there would be a
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
slight fiscal impact and we're in the
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
process of nailing down exactly what
 
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be but there is um no
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
issue with defail in this case Okay so
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other question is um in my
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
mind was what can of worms were opening
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
up in terms of other potential services
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
like this so when you say these are you
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
were defining the difference between um
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
the right now what is free which is the
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh manag manag what was the terms I I
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
need to write these terms preventative
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
care so under federal law um
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
preventative Services as defined by this
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
Federal um group as preventative that
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's clinical evidence to support
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
this those Services need to provi be
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
provided without cost sharing got it all
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
other services in your medical plan are
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
typically covered in some way by cost
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
sharing so it could be subject to
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
deductible it could have Co insurance
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
have a code what do you just you just
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
say cost sharing cost sharing okay cost
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
sharing so depending on your benefit
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
design that's how much cost sharing
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
you'll have to pay so if you're thinking
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
of the tiered plans and the um the
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
silver gold Platinum bronze plans the
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
difference in those plans is your amount
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
of cost sharing so you may have 30% cost
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
sharing or 20% cost sharing or 10% cost
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
sharing depending on what level um metal
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
level you have so that cost sharing
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
amount and every plan's different so it
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
could be a co-pay it could be co-
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance um so it's kind of hard to Peg
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
down an exact number about what this
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
would impact but yes um to your thought
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
about how this could kind of this
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
slippery soap argument these services
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
are Diagnostic and like all other
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
diagnostic services they are typically
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
subject to come some kind of cost
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
sharing this bill is intending to carve
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
out these specific services so that
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is no cost sharing so I should
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
know this but I I I don't what's the
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
difference between co- insurance and
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
deductible and co-pay what does co-
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
insurance mean your deductible is say
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have a $1,000 deductible you're
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay that $1,000 before
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
all of your services are going to be
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
covered right without I know what co-pay
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
is so the co-pay is you go to the doctor
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
you're goingon to have a $30 co-pay
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
that's what what is co- insurance so co-
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
insurance is if you don't have a co-pay
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a co- Insurance it'll
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
be 10% co- insurance or 20% Co insurance
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
so so rather than amount it's a
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
percentage Yeah it's a percentage so if
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
the contracted we rate is $100 and you
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
have 20% Co Insurance you're responsible
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
for $20 okay so I put dollar dollars
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
over co-pay and percentages over co-
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and now I know the difference
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
okay so the question then is um in terms
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
of this particular issue was that it
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
seemed that this one of the part of this
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
discussion was that all right we get the
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
the free mamogram you get to get that
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
you have that now they have they're U
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're not sure there's they're not
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
they're not getting and so then we're
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to now send you off to get this
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
more expensive
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
MRI but that technically could be still
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
preventative because well I'm just
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
saying in my mind it still could be
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
preventative because we're making sure
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
that what we didn't see or could see
 
01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
were the the first free one that we now
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
want to you know drill down and do
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
better okay so the then would be in in
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
terms of a comparison to other cancers
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
okay so if they uh if they uh do uh I
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe a colonoscopy which is
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
free and then they say well you know
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
we're concerned whether you know you're
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
something else so I don't know where
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
they get to find other when the thing is
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
matized and moved around but in other
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
things where where in terms of cost
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
sharing one is actually we're trying to
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
help you cure you you know we're trying
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
to like go in there and we're going to
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
start pulling things out you know the
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
tumors out versus we just we're still
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
not really sure whether you do have
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
breast cancer right so in other words if
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
we were to narrow this bill to that that
 
01:04:46.599 --> 01:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
we were to narrow this bill to that that
one

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
MRI that is a
 
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.510 align:start position:0%
MRI that is a
followup

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
from the the mamogram is that possible
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
could we do it as that to just simply
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
say that if it is a it's it's only a
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
followup but then any other Pro you know
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
if if going forward the decision is to
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
do that that you know all bets off it's
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
still the cost sharing but that yeah so
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
the way it's written now there's nothing
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
wrong with this language um or if you
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
want to limit it in some way you do that
 
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
as well it's just going to come
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
down impact is going to be that's right
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
I'm saying what my fear of this is that
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
we've opened up the door for all kinds
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
of other body you know me toos that we
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
want we too want to get rid of the CER
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
and and let's face it the whole reason
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
we have high deductibles is because
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
people want to have a lower premium so
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
start when you start getting rid of
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
deductibles you're you're you know
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're yeah it's all you're messing all
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act you're messing up the
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
balance by by start picking it you know
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
pulling things out so I was just focus
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
in on the fact that we have this uh you
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
know we have these two things is
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy and mammograms that are that
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
are free and so that and that if if it
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
was really true if this issue if we just
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
were focusing in on to ensure that we
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
really are making the right diagnosis so
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
that you get one free one yeah I mean
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's an option that would be for the
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
policy makers to make so now I'll open
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
up to the committee members and hear
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
what other people are
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
thinking yes representative pelli I
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
guess I have a um general question about
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
more information we seem to have a lot
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
of bills related to um requiring
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage so I'm trying to
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
figure out you know what is that list
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we already have and then I'm sure
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
that will be added to every year and
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
then you know the cost sharing issue so
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
these are the two areas regardless of
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
what the health issue is I just see both
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
lists growing and then at what how do
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
you determine which one goes on you know
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
is eligible for the insurance coverage
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the cost sharing and which health
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
issue is not it gets to be very
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
complicated such a good question um it
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
is true and I meant to
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
have Kristen to one up U the last time I
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
did it it was Pam smling was still our
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee researcher and uh and she was
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
maintaining the list for me um I would
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
say after the Affordable Care Act passed
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen a reduction in health
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
insurance mandates uh because of this uh
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that that uh the state might
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it's a new a new mandate
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
um uh in this case I would say I was in
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
the room for almost all 40 of them when
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
I first got on this committee the only
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
mandates we had was uh the first one was
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh whether social workers can provide
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Coverage that was mandated
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
that shows you how long ago that was um
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
but yes we I think that's a good idea
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
I'll get that list for everybody it's
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's an amazing list to see all the
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
things that over the years the
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislature has dealt with when it comes
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
to to the
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
mandates so but yeah representative
 
01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:00.789 align:start position:0%
mandates so but yeah representative
Bros

01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
Bros
 
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
right um I just want to say that I mean
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
I thought we heard really compelling
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
testimony from um doctors from patients
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
um people and other people in the field
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
about um women not not going to get the
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up exams because of the cost
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
because of their families because of
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
missing work and uh I think that this
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
one is just too important not to to just
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
to just pass by and I I I think it's
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
important that that um well I'm not
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
passing it by I'm just saying I don't
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
want to give a a free get out of jail I
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
mean how many how many MRIs are you want
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
to give away now if you're saying is
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
that one of the one of the questions was
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
that once you had an MRI y then then you
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
don't get the free mammographies anymore
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
that was what one of the comments was
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
you don't get them anymore and that
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
everyone has to be the the MRI from that
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
then on out well but you do need
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
followup once you've been diagnosed I
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
well that was no that right well okay
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
but then you're a cancer patient so are
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
we going to say that every cancer
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
patient not just this one should be get
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
free MRIs what do we do when other
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
patients get followup for cancer I'm
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
just saying when it comes to cancer I
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
assume all MRIs I assume they're doing
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
by MRIs but some of them might be just
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds I don't
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
know or or they do to do a biopsy is
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
surg I mean that's even more money but
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they get they have to pay for
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
that but yes but you lose oh I'm sorry
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
re thank you chairman I'm sorry
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
um it's Diagnostic Imaging we're talking
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
about we're talking about surveillance
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
Imaging that's a term that we use right
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
when we have somebody with a um an
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
illness and we're trying to just surveil
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
it we know they have the cancer or that
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
they're at risk for it right we demand
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
that they do certain things the
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies will cover cover
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
those modalities the problem that we're
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
having is there's a gap between
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
affordability here it is in the
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company best interest to
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
address their proper care if we continue
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
to just ignore their orders or to
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
continue to believe that these patients
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
are going to just suck it up and pay for
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic imaging you're
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
mistaken what ends up happening is they
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
end up not going they end up ending in
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
the ER I end up getting the progress
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
notes from let me let me just cut you
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
off so you're saying we should do this
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
for all cancer patients I'm saying that
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
we need to allow insurance companies to
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
make better policies I don't want the
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
general court to get involved here but
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
when they're not well we're we're we're
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
involved that's what this bill is yes is
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
are we going to say no more deductibles
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
co-pays for cancer patients no this is
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
just a no that's today this is
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance that's today Ry will be
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
back next week next year with another
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
one another cancer patient
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is today today is just this
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
particular you know breast cancer but um
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know prostate cancer you name all
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
the cancers are out there that I'm sure
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
they use these MRI machines for right I
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
think you're not looking at the big
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
picture here and that is that there are
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
more and more providers that are trying
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
to fight insurance companies to get
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
these things done and they're not
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
getting done because of that reason
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
these people are going to die okay I I I
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
hear you but you are you ready to pay
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium for every cancer
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
patient to get all these MRIs for free
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
when we're avoiding the long-term cost
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
of emergency visits over and over again
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
because they've been avoiding it yes
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative prelli what I have
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
in my notes is that once you're uh
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as a cancer patient then you
 
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
are ineligible for the yearly test and
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
then you have to pay for your test so I
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
understand if I mean I'm I'm not sure
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
why they why we're in enabling the um
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
loss of that yearly preventive test now
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
that you've been diagnosed so should
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
that still be right well that's where I
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
was getting into is that if so you get
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
the one to get the each year and then if
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
there's other um tests that you would
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
need that would be subject to your
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
insurance so but you shouldn't lose your
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
preventative test you shouldn't lose
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
because you might not need it you might
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
let's say let's say this preven just
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
came back
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
negative okay that there was it was it
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
was a shadow it wasn't as bad as it was
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
but people what we heard from the
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
testimony was then then they have to be
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting this MRI
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
forever that they would they wouldn't
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get the the once you're
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
stamped as a cancer patient the way I
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
have it in my notes is that you're not
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
eligible for that yearly preventive test
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
which doesn't make sense right it does
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
not make sense to does not make sense
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
spear uh having multiple breast cancer
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
patients in my family uh the
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
Reconstruction usually eliminates the
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
ability to get uh often eliminates the
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
ability to get a uh mography a mography
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
you have to go for an go for an MRI at
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh and having had a sister that's had it
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
twice uh I don't know I feel bad about
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
cutting that out afterwards you know not
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
making it free because she waited 10
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
years before she did anything and then
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
it became a very big deal because she
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have the money to get the
 
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.990 align:start position:0%
didn't have the money to get the
MRI

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
MRI
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
so okay I agree with you I I think we
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to do it it's buy now or pay later
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
so when you redo this fiscal note are
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
you calculating the free the the that
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
this would be forever ever for any
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
patient that once once they've been
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer that that if they
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a little bit of a
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the preventative
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
Services preventative Services are meant
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
to help screen patients that would
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise not be screened to catch
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
Things Early once you have cancer you're
 
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
at a different level we're not doing
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
these preventative screenings to make
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure you're getting it caught early
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're like you said you're once cancer
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
patient there's a different level a
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
different standard of care that's
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
applied to you so when we do our fiscal
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
note analysis what we're going to be
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
looking at is how much for these
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
specific Imaging that's mentioned in
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
this bill which is specific to breast
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
cancer so we're talking Diagnostic and
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
supplemental breast screenings of those
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
that are subject to cost sharing how
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
much cost sharing is being paid by the
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
patient because that is what's going to
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
be shifted to the insurers now having to
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
take on that complete responsibility and
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is what we'll be doing the analysis
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
on to see how much of an impact that is
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that and that would assume forever
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
right that that patient was going to
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to have that more expensive MRI
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
every year we would have to do
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
much much bigger modeling for that
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
because what we're looking at is claims
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
data for a year assuming you know
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
there's so many women getting these
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
screenings right in one year say there's
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know a thousand of them how many of
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
that thousand are doing the diagnostic
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
and um preventative that's how we would
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
be modeling it if you want to do more an
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
Actuarial analysis of the overall risk
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
and how that we would have to do some
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
kind of mandate study for that the
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
Mandate study so um because the issue is
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
so you're you're saying we're you're
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
just going to look at the just the cost
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
sharing for cost sharing Services
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
getting an MRI in one
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
year and so theoretically that that
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
should pick up the people who are
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
getting have been getting it multiple
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
years in past years yes if they had one
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the last year I think there's there's
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
some other aspects to this that you
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't really want to gloss over because
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of cost sharing you have to
 
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
pay is highly dependent on the type of
 
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
plan you have if you have a platinum
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
level plan the amount you're going to
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay is a lot less than someone
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
in a bronze level plan right so that's a
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
huge factor in this is there's a lot of
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
different plans out there and the amount
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
of cost sharing you're going to have to
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
pay for not just this but all your
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
services is going to depend a lot on
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
that plan so if you were in a bronze
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
plan and you find out you have cancer
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
the next year you move up to a platinum
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
because you know you're going to have a
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
lot of Health cost that's not going to
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
be captured in the analysis that we're
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
doing so there there's a lot of other
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
factors that go into this we're strictly
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost shifting of the cost
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
sharing to the
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
insurers yeah so we don't know how much
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
adverse selection is is this with this
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
mandate would would cost CA this man
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
this mate could cause if you want to
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
look at more longterm and some of these
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
other issues that we're talking about it
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be a different type of
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
study that we be pretty complicated to
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
figure out so we would need a lot more
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
time to do something like that then we'd
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
have to do a mandate study yeah
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
something like it's it's not really a
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
mandate because it would be just a cost
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
sharing but um we're talking about a lot
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
of different issues being thrown out
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
here so if we wanted us to do some kind
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
of study about that we'd have to have
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know clearly defined what you're
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
looking for if we're talking about
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
long-term effects of you know out of
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
pocket for cancer patients and what that
 
01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
means for them that's a much different
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
study than doing a fiscal note for this
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill okay all right so you you'll have
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note yes we'll try to get it
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
over to OS today great all right so
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
we'll put this off to unless anybody
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
else has anything else they want to
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
offer up we'll put this off to some
 
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
offer up we'll put this off to some
other

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
other
time

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
c yeah we yeah um Katherine yeah yeah so
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
so this is just a subcommittee you know
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify I hope as theor
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
clarify just two points sure yes but
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah in general when a subcommittee you
 
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
don't put a pin card you got got I
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I don't have this in
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
transportation so I'm not as familiar
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted um as a prime
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill there were two
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to make I know the
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
concern about the slippery slope it's
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to talk about who should
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
entitled to coverage for different
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
conditions but um I wanted to reiterate
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
from the initial hearing that we have
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the fourth highest rate of breast cancer
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the country um it is incredibly
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
prevalent and yet only about 16% of
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
patients need to have this diagnostic or
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
supplemental Imaging so there's say that
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
again how many about 16% after their
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
mammograms need to go on to have the
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
supplemental Diagnostic Imaging so while
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of reason to to catch
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
early it's actually a smaller number of
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
people needing that followup so that
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
limits the cost and I also just wanted
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
to mention in terms of the continued
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing after you've had
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
cancer um I think it's about 5 to 10
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
years that you would need that sort of
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
um skipping over the mamogram and going
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
to the diagnostic imaging it's not
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
forever okay but it's two confusing you
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
gave two stats there they were they
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
actually are confusing to me because you
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
say okay we we're the fourth in the
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
country that would means we have a lot
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
of people who have breast cancer then
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
you said but only 16 would need to go on
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
to get this MRI I realize that they
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
opposing my my point being it's it is
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
this is a very common cancer right so
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about how do we I
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
guess way what sort of uh procedures or
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
testing and among different conditions
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
or different cancers we want to be
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
considering this is something that's
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
really really common in New Hampshire
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that being said it's still a small
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
subsect people that need to go on for
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
this extra level of imag or supplement
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
so it does limit the cost in that regard
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
and that would be another 5 to 10 years
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
and then it would be 5 to 10 years until
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
they're out of the woods that is my
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
understanding yes okay great thank you
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you any other okay great
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
thanks all right let's move on to the
 
01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
thanks all right let's move on to the
next

01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
one uh no that was what we just
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
did okay
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
Board of conflict
 
01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
Board of conflict

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:33.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
um we found that I guess my researchers
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
found I just got a something from her
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
today she said that this a conflict of
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
interest and who has a conflict is is
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
all over the board in terms of who does
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
for different boards there are different
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations already but she
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
said no one has it where just one board
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
member has that decision even though
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
this the attorney general the way the
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
appointee do I have this right do I have
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
Bill are you asking a question yes I'm
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
asking you a question this is a
 
01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:23.350 align:start position:0%
asking you a question this is a
subcommittee

01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
speak uh hi I I'm representative Jess
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
Edwards and um the original Bill uh
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
identified a problem that uh in the
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
act it it conflicts of interest were
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
prohibited but there were no Provisions
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
for what to do once a conflict was
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
identified and and how to go about uh
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
removing somebody with a conflict of
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
interest so the the bill as
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
introduced attempted to begin that
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
conversation and and provided uh a a way
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
of doing it um and you're referring to
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment and I'm I'm I'm less
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with the amendment the
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
amendment may have been offered by
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um and uh and
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it and that's why I came to the
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee today to listen to your
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussion because I'm less interested
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
how uh the the tactics of of working
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
through the conflict of interest I just
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
assume follow whatever standard
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
approaches the state might use um I I I
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm really concerned about is that
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
there is no there is no provision for
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
removing somebody with a conflict of
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
interest and and that's a a flaw in the
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I suppose I could have done
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
better homework before presenting it to
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
the committee but I I believe that this
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
committee with the jurisdiction would
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
would have some wisdom about the other
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
ways in which we handle such a problem
 
01:23:21.679 --> 01:23:23.470 align:start position:0%
ways in which we handle such a problem
and

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
so I I I I threw it over the transom Mr
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
chair I gotcha okay so uh if you were
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
compare to our conflict of
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
interests I believe that all we're supp
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's up to us
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
individually to uh make notification to
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
everybody that we have a conflict but
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
that in that form we can check off and
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
say but we're still going to participate
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
or we're not but at least we made the
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
disclosure to everybody that there is a
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
a perception that they might have a
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.950 align:start position:0%
 
interest

01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we could we could do it that way I
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would choose to to to to go more on
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
offense because this board is very small
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
it it it's only got like five people
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
with some alternates and this board has
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous power to demand from the
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
market uh very specific ific proprietary
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
information that has high commercial
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
value and and because I think the threat
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
from somebody who's unethical being on
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
this board is significantly larger than
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
having one of 400 of us running around
 
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh I I would I would want there to be um
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
a more difficult standard for that
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
individual remaining on the board I I
 
01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
would want a way to to remove them okay
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
so if I read this bill your bill
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
correctly it's the governor and Council
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
removes removes the person is that is
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
that correct yes I I I thought that
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
there should be some Authority and I
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know where to put it and if U if
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
the committee sees um a a better way of
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
doing it I I'm I'm I am fully in support
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
of the smartest way to do this I just
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to go naked
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
with this much uh commercial
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
value potentially
 
01:25:28.679 --> 01:25:31.470 align:start position:0%
value potentially
exposed

01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough any questions to the
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I'm certainly not
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of conflict of
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
interest but I'm just curious and my
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
apologies if this was covered during the
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing uh because I actually
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
don't remember whether it was or not um
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any reason to believe that
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
there is a problem of conflict of
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
interest uh with the uh prescription
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
drug affordability
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
board I I I'd say in general whenever
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
you allow people access to very high
 
01:26:07.719 --> 01:26:09.390 align:start position:0%
you allow people access to very high
value

01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
data uh it is wise to assume that there
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
will be people who will abuse that trust
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
and that you should anticipate rational
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
ways of removing the threat so that the
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh the security of the data uh and the
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the board is preserved so
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh so I I would I would I'm not saying
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
that there's anyone now on the board but
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
given that this is a brand new board and
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
it got set up rapidly and prematurely I
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
think I we we left some things out and
 
01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the things that I
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
think we left out that we should put
 
01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.270 align:start position:0%
think we left out that we should put
back

01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
in well you didn't leave it out it's
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
actually in statute right now there is a
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest process in the in
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
the current law ye yes sir but there's
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
no removal process and so what this bill
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
intends to do is to create a a
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
methodology to remove somebody that has
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest it's it's one
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
thing to say you have a conflict of
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
interest it's another thing to say you
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
have a conflict of interest and you can
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
no longer serve on the board and have
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
access to highly confidential valuable
 
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.430 align:start position:0%
access to highly confidential valuable
commercial

01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
information so if I read the current law
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
it it's basically what we do for
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves you you identify that you have
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
a conflict in the public me in five day
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
period advance of the meeting you're
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to announce that you have a
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
conflict but there's no take you want to
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
process to get them
 
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.470 align:start position:0%
process to get them
off

01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
I again to protect the Integrity of the
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
board and te the protect the Integrity
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
of the expensive information of the held
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
by private citizens I think yes we we
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
need to be able to be proactive okay
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
Ammon you go
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you um I'm not on the
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but I I do have a question
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh how would the
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
process work with the governor and the
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
council do they would they take make a
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
motion take a vote and it would be a
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
six-way vote to remove someone how do
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
you foresee that procedure playing
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
out I I did not thank you for the
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
question I didn't I didn't get very deep
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
deep into how the procedure would work I
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
put put an approach in the bill and I'm
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
open to how it could be done and if for
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
some reason uh the sub committee decides
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
not to try to fix this bill and isn't
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
happy with the bill as is
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
is I I will regret that I didn't put
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
more time into it before it came to the
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee and work on it in the future
 
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
committee okay represent uh represent m
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
c is next uh thank you uh I'm I'm really
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
curious who would who would appoint this
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
board and and what kind of people would
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
be would make make up the the the
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
committee the the prescription drug
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
affordability board is already in
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
statute and the methods of who appoints
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
which member is is already in statute th
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
what this is saying is in the in the
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill there is a provision saying that
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
there shall not be conflicts of interest
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
amongst the board
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
members what the bill before you intends
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
to do is to create a mechanism to remove
 
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
an appointed board member member who has
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
been identified as having a conflict of
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
interest so this is this is there the
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
the the bill is the law is silent on on
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
the removal aspect no I understand that
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming you're referring to
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
things like insider trading is that
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
correct that could be an example or it
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
could be somebody who just has some
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
other uh vested interest or or opens up
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
a side shop on Consulting because this
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
information is extremely valuable and
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
and could make somebody a lot of money
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
field forell thank you so who has
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this board so who
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
initially appoints and then I I'm sorry
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
I keep thinking org charts but we don't
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
have one here so who ultimately does
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
this board um respond
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
to and who has jurisdiction who the
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
appointments are made the Governor
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate Speaker of the
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
House appoint they appoint but they
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
would have jurisdiction over this board
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
so would they be the appropriate
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism for removal so so one of the
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
weaknesses of of of the initial Statute
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
in my view and to your point is is that
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
this board is highly autonomous once it
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
gets going it it's highly autonomous it
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
really reports to no one for example
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
even though it's Bud it has to have
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
accountability to somebody well I'm
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
going to try to explain some of that so
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
so so to the extent even that it has a
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
budget uh the budget goes through the
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS but but he or she does not have the
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
authority to change the budget it's just
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
simply an
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrative transmission of the
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
request of the board for it to go to
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
into the budget cycle and and prior to
 
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 the uh uh the the finance committee
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an opportunity to take
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
care of the budget so so this board once
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's established and it has already been
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
established and been running for a while
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
it it runs very much on its own and
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
anytime you I I I don't know I'm just a
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
cynic I I think that if you have too
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
much power Consolidated in a very small
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
group and you have no checks and
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
balances on it you run the risk of abuse
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
and and so one way to reign in the abuse
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
in my view is if there is a conflict of
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
interest have a mechanism to swap that
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
individual out because the board is very
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
independent okay representative Gibbs
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes am I correct uh
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um that you
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored a bill last year to to um uh
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
abolish the prescription drug
 
01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.189 align:start position:0%
abolish the prescription drug
affordability

01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
board I I I submitted two bills one of
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
them abolished it and one of it amended
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the board
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
significantly and I provided the option
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
to this committee for debate and
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
discussion so you debated two of my
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
bills one was to improve and fix the
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
problems that I identified in the board
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
and one was simply to abolish it so I I
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
I should add that I'm now a member of
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
the board I I was appointed in August to
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
this board and so at least now I have an
 
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
Insider view of the the the the power
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
and role of the board a follow up to
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
what you um just mentioned earlier about
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
the budget uh so the board now has a
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
budget uh which will be uh in the
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
biannual budget uh every other year and
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the budget would be controlled
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee so in that
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
sense um the board is accountable to the
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee and ultimately uh to
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
Senate more so than it was and I I have
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
to actually go back and double check
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
with my uh budget assistant I I don't
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
know if the provisions of hb1 or hb2
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
rather were constructed for this budget
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
cycle and then expires or whether it's
 
01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:22.149 align:start position:0%
cycle and then expires or whether it's
got

01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the the the continuing nature of law
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I I I should be able to answer your
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
question better but I don't know the
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so yeah representative po sorry um
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
sorry this is just a clarification so we
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
did have rep mer Merchants um Amendment
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
but we're not looking at that we're
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
still looking at the original Bill we're
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
still talking about the original Bill
 
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.990 align:start position:0%
still talking about the original Bill
thank

01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.390 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so people feel they have a vision here
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
anybody feel one way or the other what
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
they want to do about this or we could
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
put it off and think about this for
 
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.510 align:start position:0%
put it off and think about this for
another

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
week I don't think we have an answer yet
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have an answer okay let's we'll
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
put this one
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
off yes representative Amon has a
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh just a question so
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we we haven't
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
considered uh puts the opice on the
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to determine what a
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest is uh it also
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
removes the cohabitation language that's
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
in the earlier part of the bill removing
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
the cohabitation language is just fine
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
with me I I I it bugs me that married
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
people get hit with this and the co
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
cohabitors don't don't but you can
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
strike all the cohabitant I don't I
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think placing all of this
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
at the AG's office is is the right way
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do it that was uh representative
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
Merchant he chairs the board um right
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
and that's and like I said U no nobody
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
else has ever done that before so but it
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
goes back to the way the statute's
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
written now is the same conflict of
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
interest that we all abide by which is
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
disclosure so so I'd be happy if their
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meets again to i' be happy
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
to participate okay great yes represent
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
um just want thank you for taking the
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
question would a CA somebody who gets
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
financial support from like a
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry too when they
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
run for office would that be a conflict
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission I'm outside of my subject
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
matter expertise and so I'll just
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
disclose that on personal level I would
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
consider that a conflict of interest and
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
I would personally disclose it but I'm a
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
highly ethical
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
individual I I would think that if you
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah if you were you were getting a
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
check from a pharmaceutical company you
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
would have to claim that make everybody
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
know right okay great thanks all right

why we have representative PR here
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
though if you don't mind why is he here
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
no I have a question while he's still
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
here oh relative to that if you mind you
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
can go ask him out in the hall no well
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
it's for the okay I I we're not in that
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%

not this is not a free-for-all okay next
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to take up because I guess
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
this is now turned into a problem all
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
right 1365 substitution of biological
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%

01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%

reasons um before um I get into the
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're opposed to the
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I thought I would just take
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
a quick minute kind of like a one-on-one
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
to just to talk about um the differences
 
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.550 align:start position:0%
to just to talk about um the differences
between

01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
um uh biosimilars and interchangeable
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
biosimilars and kind of what the
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
designation is and and to talk about the
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
differences if the committee will allow
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh biosimilars are a biologic medicines
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
that are highly similar to and have no
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
clinical difference from Brand
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
originator biologic medicines biosimilar
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
can also provide lower cost treatment
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
options for patients um and the um you
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
can look for data and trends that uh
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
biosimilar utilization is uh
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
significantly increasing which is
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
helping drive down patient cost for
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
these specialty
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
medicines um but it's also important to
 
01:41:43.709 --> 01:41:43.719 align:start position:0%
note that biosimilars are more complex
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
than generic drugs and are subject to
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
different legal requirements so uh
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
biologics and small molec ules which are
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
pills um generics completely different
 
01:41:58.109 --> 01:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
totally apples to oranges uh biologics
 
01:41:58.119 --> 01:41:59.070 align:start position:0%
totally apples to oranges uh biologics
are

01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
injectables um and the the manufacturing
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
has to be so precise on all these
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
biologics that patients are putting into
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
their bodies um it's completely
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
different than with a pill where you
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
follow a certain
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
recipe and that can be done 100% of the
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
time for all of these
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
generics an interchangeable biosimilar
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
is a biosimilar that the FDA has
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
determined meets additional criteria
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
that manufacturers have to
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
undergo so that it may be substituted
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
for its brand reference product at the
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy interchangeability is regulated
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
under federal law and is a special
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
designation made by the FDA after
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
scientific and Technical
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
assessments these involve additional
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
extensive testing that can take a
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have to provide additional
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
investment in time um so that the FDA
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
can undergo this this really extensive
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
testing to ensure that the
 
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
interchangeable is 100% exactly the same
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
as the originator
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
product most biologics dispensed at the
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy are injectable products such as
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
injectable pens that are
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
self-administered by patients or by
 
01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:17.719 align:start position:0%
caregivers when assessing
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
interchangeability FDA May evaluate
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
potential differ in product
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics such as differences in
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
dosing or delivery devices to help avoid
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
Administration errors misdosing and
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
other errors that a patient or caregiver
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
might have when administering one of
 
01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.109 align:start position:0%
might have when administering one of
these

01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
biologics it's important to understand
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
that FDA assesses only whether a
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
biosimilar is interchangeable with its
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
brand reference product and one of the
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
most important kind of keys to this is
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
the FDA does not evaluate
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
whether one biosimilar is
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with any other
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
biosimilar in other words FDA does not
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
assess potential differences between one
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilar and another
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilar even though
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
FDA has determined that both products
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
are interchangeable with the same brand
 
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
reference product so you can kind of go
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
and you can look for clinical trials you
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
can look for data you can look for
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
research and you won't find anything
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
because this is not legal within FDA to
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
substitute one interchangeable for
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
another it's never been done before so
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
um this really harms potentially harms
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
patients if passed because a patient
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
would be putting something into their
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
body that um has never been evaluated
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
from a scientific
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint Pharmacy substitution
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
practices are regulated under state law
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy substitution laws in all 50
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
States including New Hampshire permit a
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to dispense an inter
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilar only when the
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
brand reference product has been
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed and believed the current
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
biosimilar substitution statute we
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
believe that the current biosimilar
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
statute is working well for patients
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
here in the state and in the other 49
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
states as
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
well with all of that in mind I just
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of talk about some of the
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
merits why we are in opposition to this
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill we believe that the bill would
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
undermine physician choice and disrupt
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
patient care the bill ignores the fda's
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
fundamental role in assessing products
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
for safe Pharmacy
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
substitution the bill would declare
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
interchangeable bio similars that share
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
reference product as interchangeable
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
with each other even though the FDA
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
hasn't evaluated whether it would be
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a pharmacy to dispense a
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
sub substituted product when a physician
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
has prescribed a specific
 
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.350 align:start position:0%
has prescribed a specific
interchangeable

01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
interchangeable
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
biosimilar already under existing New
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law when a physician
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
prescribes a brand reference product a
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy may substitute any biosimilar
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
that FDA has determined is
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with that referenced
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
product so pharmacists already can
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
substitute an available interchangeable
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
biosimilar when a patient has been
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
prescribed a brand reference product can
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
I can I stop you right there I'm
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
confused has the FDA determined what's
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
biosimilar or
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
not yes so the FDA goes through testing
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
and they they can evaluate and say yes
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is a bio similar which is highly
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
similar right but then there's
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
additional testing for interchangeable
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
designation that a manufacturer needs to
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
additional investment additional time
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
for the FDA to go through and do
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
extensive testing to receive a special
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable designation and they
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
have or they have not done that yet yes
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
that's that has taken place so all we
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
have to do is make sure it's been
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA is interchangeable
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
bio similar that expression that that
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
would make you okay with this bill
 
01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
no um so and I'm I'm getting there um
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
but but basically you know a a
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
physician um May prescribe a specific
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosa for a reason they
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
want their patient to receive the actual
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
product often the prescribed products uh
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
might be under a preferred patients
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
insurance plan the physician May
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
prescribe it by name since the product
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
will result in a lower cost for the
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
patient or the product won't require PR
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
prior authorization or other
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
administrative hurdles so if we require
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
that the doctor has to now when he
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
writes the prescription have some kind
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
of code next to it like the generics did
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
so they can say that it can be
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable if it's approved by the
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
FDA uh yes but one interchangeable for
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
the other interchangeable it it's it's
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
it can't happen legally because there's
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
no studies that have been conducted you
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
say legally no there's no illegal right
 
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
the FDA is not shutting it down in your
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
mind it's not legal but in terms it's
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
also not Physicians all tell us they
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
tell me that they want this
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay they want it the board of
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
Minister wants it the insurance
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
companies want it the only person in
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
this room who doesn't want this bill is
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
you and I'm trying to understand sure
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
but the role of the FDA the the goal of
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
the the FDA is to ensure patient safety
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
right so if the FDA says it's okay it
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't the FDA says this is not okay if
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
the FD so okay the FDA is I haven't
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
heard from them yet so but directly but
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
um all right I'm totally confused but
 
01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:29.629 align:start position:0%
um all right I'm totally confused but
all

01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
right and and also you know Physicians
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
have the the opportunity to write
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
dispenses written on the prescription so
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist has no choice uh to
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
substitute but this bill if passed would
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire a complete outlier
 
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
this is one bill introduced in one state
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
and this would totally make New
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an outlier I think this would
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
cause uh confusion with Physicians so a
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
physician might prescribe an
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biologic to a patient
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden this gets changed to
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
another interchangeable if the the
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
doctor was not aware um of this law you
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
know there are different um delivery
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
mechanisms as well so just because one
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
interchangeable is another
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
interchangeable means the delivery might
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
not be exactly the same and the
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
physician might not know that
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
speaking don't he's speaking oh ask
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
please my goal was to be
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
brief so does the committee do we want
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
to maybe just inter room study this bill
 
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
since this is evidently not ready for
 
01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.830 align:start position:0%
since this is evidently not ready for
prime

01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
time okay does anybody have a problem
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
with inter room study yeah what I'm
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
asking a question now is everybody okay
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
with inter room study the
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
bill okay I well I represent him M's
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
first you want to he's El set
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Speer and looking at this
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill when it first came out I did a bit
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
of looking around and Europe does this
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
extensively I found all kinds of
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
approvals for this kind of thing all
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
throughout Europe so this is not
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
really you know a pie in the sky brand
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
new nobody's ever looked at it before
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we may be behind the time
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
I mean that's typical in some areas but
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
this isn't really new and that Europe
 
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
has been doing it for a while and
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
getting some pretty darn good results so
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
I I think saying that we're taking all
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
these risks and everything has been
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
proven in a very large platform to not
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
quite be the case which is why we should
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
go to inrim study now that which is fine
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
so are you have you been looking at any
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
of that before we say that this is such
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
a high risk well I'm just going off
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
guidance from FDA and you know we
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
obviously patient safety is number one
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
and you know what FDA says is is what we
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
have to go
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.550 align:start position:0%
have to go
by

01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
question but you did take FDA as as okay
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
for the the P Bill I said the FDA has
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
Pierce uh thank you Mr chairman um to
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
simplify this in the previous
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
presentation the way I understood it is
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
that a a drug company comes up with drug
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
a and then another company comes up with
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
these are not drugs these are well part
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
bio specific bio yes a bio medicine I
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
understand and second company comes up
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
with b and they find out that uh B is is
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with a then a third
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
company comes up with c and
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
currently C is interchangeable with a
 
01:51:42.589 --> 01:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
but not with B this law would make a b
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
and c all interchangeable correct this
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
so it make b equals c right so that you
 
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
so that if B was prescribed you could
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
use a or C okay well you'd want to go to
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
C most likely we we have the chart
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's what I I just want to clarify
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay yes go ahead it's not about the
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
chart okay
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
r hi I just have a question do you think
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is a leg State Legislative issue uh
 
01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
no I believe this is more of a federal
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
issue okay thank you okay any more
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
questions is are you still yeah just I
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
mean I certainly support the idea of
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
studying it because the MDR that
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative spear brought up were
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
totally different but Europe's Med
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
device regulations and those regulations
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
so there might be something to be
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
learned from there uh my my question uh
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
to Mr Kent is on the form factor issue
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what comes to mind to me how
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
how big of an impact is that when
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
talking about one interchangeable or
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
bial similar to another in other words
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
could I get be expecting or have a
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
patient that needs an auto injector that
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know fires in and then pulls out
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
right you know that that type of design
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
and actually end up with a syringe like
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
a Victoza kind of pen that you have to
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
dial up and put a needle on I mean could
 
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
are the form factors potentially that
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
different my question track here well
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
are the form factors that different is
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
that an impact is that one issue yeah I
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
mean especially if a a patient isn't
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
educated on how to use it um if I'm
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
following you
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
following you
correctly

01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
long question but anyways I certainly
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
support studying the issue great all
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
right so would like to make the motion
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
represent buroughs you want to make the
 
01:53:37.229 --> 01:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
okay we all do that just to see if
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying attention
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
right okay all right representative
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
burough second by representative M's
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
interim study is there any discussion on
 
01:53:51.629 --> 01:53:51.639 align:start position:0%
the motion of in room
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
study ma second oh maer second sorry
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay um all those in favor raise your
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
hand one two three four five six six zip
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your time thank sorry
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
we can't help you better
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
but okay
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
1571 requiring insurance coverage for
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring devices for people
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
with diabetes
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a mandate
 
01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.109 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a mandate
too

01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
just just
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
kill killing me
 
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.270 align:start position:0%
kill killing me
okay

01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
so how how did we we left this bill was
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
this this was a bill wasn't this one
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
that we needed a study the financial
 
01:54:41.239 --> 01:54:42.229 align:start position:0%
that we needed a study the financial
study

01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
on interim the um well we need the
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate study as we call it I call it
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
the Murphy law but
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
but the Mandate study this one does have
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note we did complete the fiscal
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
note but you're correct that it was it's
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of the benefit right
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
so if you would like to do a mandate
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
study we could do that if um if we would
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
just need the formal request from the
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
committee to the department that you're
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
requesting um a mandate study and if if
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
you do do that it's good to be as
 
01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:17.719 align:start position:0%
specific as possible as to what exactly
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
you're looking for if you want us to
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
study this bill as written or with um
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
certain amendments or changes or
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
note no there's a from what I printed
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
out the small or this morning or last
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
night there's definitely a FIS on we did
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
prepare one and I believe this is
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
printed from so what I'm looking I'm
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the back page is this verbage
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
I there's the chart and then there's
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
like a page and a half of okay
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
information okay so you want to walk us
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
through here and show us what where
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
where where's it I don't see any dollars
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
here it's
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
indeterminable right no we got that we
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
all we all have that okay but it was
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
just there was zeros sure so no I don't
 
01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.229 align:start position:0%
just there was zeros sure so no I don't
can

01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
I so it's in your fiscal no is in
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
terminal is it where where's money where
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
money so it's in terminal it will
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
increase but we don't know we'd have to
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
do a mandate study to give you a rough
 
01:56:50.119 --> 01:56:53.470 align:start position:0%
do a mandate study to give you a rough
all

01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
right there it goes into more detail
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
explaining that's so that's all I
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
remember when when we ended up was that
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any idea what we were
 
01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any idea what we were
talking

01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
about yes so if you want us to do a
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandate study for the bill as written um
 
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
we can do that we would just need you to
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
formally ask us to do that and specify
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
what exactly you want us to study is it
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as written or are there very
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
iations of it that you would like us to
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
with all right but but at the end of the
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
day we're the end of day we're trying to
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
model it off of the the
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
diabetes stat statute we already have
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
now which is a
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
$30 so there's different aspects to this
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
so the statute we have now limits cost
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
sharing limits to cost sharing do not
 
01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
require defray I believe what this bill
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is mandate coverage of
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
these glucose monitoring devices for
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
type one and type two and gestational
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
diabetes and I think it's my
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and my expert left because
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
he said he weren't going to take this up
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is these devices are
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
already covered routinely for type one
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
diabetes Tye their utility for type two
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and gational diabetes I think is a
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more gray so those would not
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
typically be covered for treatment of
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
those conditions
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
so what we could do if we were going to
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
do a mandate study is look at what the
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
clinical criteria are for using the
 
01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:30.679 align:start position:0%
these devices based on the Medical
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
Science as it is now whether it would be
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do that or not and then
 
01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
if there is a utilization for this we
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
could also look at estimates about what
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
this would cost to um to provide these
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
devices to this expanded population do
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
we know how much these things cost it
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
depends on the device and I unless it's
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal not no I do not know off
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but there's different
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
cost associated with it too it's the
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
device itself and then there's different
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
parts of the device stri that have to
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
get um strips and not NE I think these
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
are the implantable ones these oh parts
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not an expert on this
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
device these ones you have your phone
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
you can yeah but there's different
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
things that you have to replace in them
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I think depending on the device
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
there's different costs associated with
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
the different things that need to be
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
replaced and I think some of them you
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
have to replace certain things like
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
every two weeks some of them are I and I
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the details with that that we
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
would need a mandate study to do a
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
survey of what devices are available the
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
costs associated with them and then the
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
costs associated with expanding it to
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
this um population that under current um
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
right polic you're saying type one is
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
covered now yes okay because that's
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's the one that's most critical I
 
01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
think but you guys what do you guys
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
think about I think a mandate study
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
mandate study okay
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
great so you'd have to vote on that yes
 
01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
done that I know I have to send a letter
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
to Alex official Thing official letter
 
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
saying but we'll have in it the
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
parameters that we want to do so um yeah
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
so if you could give me a rough draft
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
which you think is probably the right
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions to ask I will work on that you
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
could do that for me that'd be great
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
send that to me and then we'll we'll
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
take this up again some other time okay
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
once we have that okay sounds good all
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
right so once we have a letter once we
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
have what we're going to be asking what
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about then we can take
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
action on this bill that make sense y
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay it's noon it's time time to go
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 03:36:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
go

03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:16.830 align:start position:0%
 
big

03:36:16.830 --> 03:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:18.860 --> 03:36:18.870 align:start position:0%
so so I
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
so so I
[Laughter]

03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:36:26.590 --> 03:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the Democrats decided to give me
 
03:36:29.550 --> 03:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
the Valentine President says cutie pie
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
Democrats I would be very surprised if
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
you would give me a

0680

03:37:58.150 --> 03:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
0680
 
03:38:02.070 --> 03:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay multiple multiple seconds multiple
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
seconds okay repres I want you uh tell
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
at thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
the committee this is almost exactly the
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
same as what was done yesterday in the
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee except for two changes on
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
page one lines 25 and 27 um it now reads
 
03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
that many years of work have led to this
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
effort which addresses the following
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
goals to put the state of New Hampshire
 
03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the driver's seat to focus on harm
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
reduction not profits and it had uh
 
03:38:32.990 --> 03:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
cited a memo from the governor
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
previously and uh that was an oversight
 
03:38:37.150 --> 03:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
on my mind I really shouldn't be naming
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
anybody within the purpose and intent so
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
I removed that um so I figured that that
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
was probably a very good cleanup there
 
03:38:48.030 --> 03:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
the other is um when I was shifting on
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
page 33 lines 5 through 11 replace the
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
previous lines I think 6 through 17 um
 
03:39:00.590 --> 03:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
so as I was Shifting the money away from
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
pensions because I was trying to match
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
this to what it past Ways and Means
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
before and the stated preference of many
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
not to have any money go to Pension
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
funds all the other versions that I saw
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
sent at least 15% so I had retained that
 
03:39:15.269 --> 03:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
which really was an oversight the idea
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
of not entangling any other federal
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
agencies into cannabis within New
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a good argument to not have
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
the pensions receiving any money and
 
03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reticence from people
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
to have their Pension funds paid by
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis funds so that 15% that had
 
03:39:30.990 --> 03:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
previously been going to the Pension
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
funds is now added added to the
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
education trust funds I know our schools
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
need it and our kids need it so um
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully that change is acceptable
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise everything else is exactly the
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
same as was presented to the
 
03:39:42.399 --> 03:39:43.990 align:start position:0%
same as was presented to the
subcommittee

03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:39:46.990 --> 03:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday great thank you uh do we have
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes the education uh trust fund um I
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
sort of have a problem with that because
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the voucher program how can we ensure
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
that this is going to go to public
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
schools and not just to the voucher
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
program can you is this out of line or
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
um so all it does is it goes to the
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant that is
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
available to to every student that
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
enrolls in a public school and now it's
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
to those children who are seeking
 
03:40:17.309 --> 03:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
education elsewhere um you know that I
 
03:40:19.630 --> 03:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
think is is one of these more policy
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
decisions that we have you know where
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
else do we send it do we send it to the
 
03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
general fund for it to go somewhere else
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
um with it offsetting swept you know I
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
think we can have those ongoing
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
discussions about whether um students
 
03:40:33.070 --> 03:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
who aren't in a public school should be
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
means tested whether students in public
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
schools itself should be means tested so
 
03:40:38.309 --> 03:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
that we're not paying for millionaires
 
03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
to go to the public schools but I think
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of outside of the
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
scope of this um given that we're going
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
to have to be spending a lot more money
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
on education going forward it seems a
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
prudent place I'd be happy to amend it
 
03:40:51.070 --> 03:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
to the general fund if you prefer that
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
but to me it seems the best
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
choice yeah I would say that uh a
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
constituent constituent of mine um this
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
morning after commenting about our being
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
on mu last night uh also mentioned that
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh as long as that money goes to reduce
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
taxes then it's a good thing and clearly
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
putting it in the trust fund will help
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
be directed back to our property taxes
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
yes and with that there is the note that
 
03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
it specifically reduces the swept so
 
03:41:23.950 --> 03:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
that that will go directly to property
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with all of that money
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
directly to their tax
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
bills okay any other discussion on the
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
motion about to pass on the amendment
 
03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:35.960 align:start position:0%

03:41:38.670 --> 03:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
