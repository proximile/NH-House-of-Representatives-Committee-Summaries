same order okay so
um

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
first order for SB 161 which is relative
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
to exemptions from rabies vaccinations
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
for dogs cats and ferrets so I'd like to
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
open up
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
SB 162.
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
oh James
 
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
I would like to open up the floor for
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that bill
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is the bill where uh currently
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
to our so there's a there's the ability
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
for someone whose animal is uh medically
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
unable to have a rabies vaccine to get
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
an exemption to the vaccine and I need
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
to agree to a number of conditions and
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
currently the exemption requires the
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
signature of uh the the animals bat uh
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
second vet and the um
 
00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
and the state vet and uh each renewal of
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
that exempt exemption requires all of
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
those signatures which is a a bit of a
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
heavy paperweight paperwork lift uh so
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it says the first
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
time around you need all the signatures
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
and then in subsequent years if you need
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
to renew the exemption then you just
 
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
need your own vets signature and I think
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is makes a lot of sense so I think
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
we should pass it
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that any other comments
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am sure I agree with the
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
comment what struck me was uh
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper's uh testimony
 
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.330 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper's uh testimony
um

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
that that they made from a department
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
level felt that it made sense also
 
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
level felt that it made sense also
okay

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
for me I also see that this streamlines
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
the renewal of exemptions
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a a good bill
 
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.690 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a a good bill
um

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
and with that I guess we can move on to
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
discussing the next bill on our agenda
 
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.889 align:start position:0%
discussing the next bill on our agenda
here

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
does any I open up the floor for any
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
questions or comments regarding SB 211
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's relative to background
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
investigations of solid waste and
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste Facility permit
 
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.710 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste Facility permit
applicants

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
yet representative Murray uh thank you
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think this this uh was a
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill that came at the request of the
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
department to make sure that we were
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
keeping in line with other Federal
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
requirements to be able to do the
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
background checks if my memory served me
 
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.430 align:start position:0%
background checks if my memory served me
yes

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
yes apparently there was some changes to
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
how the FBI
 
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
handles these background checks and they
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
wanted just to make sure if I'm correct
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
that the statutes that we have are in
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
line with that process from the federal
 
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.690 align:start position:0%
line with that process from the federal
government

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem or question
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
great okay
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
we'll move on next to SB 23
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee on meat
 
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.970 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee on meat
processing

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:57.980 align:start position:0%
processing
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh I open up the floor for any questions
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
or comments regarding that piece of
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Bixby
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
so uh this bill
 
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.290 align:start position:0%
so uh this bill
um

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
is looking particularly at the
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
processing of what are called
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
non-imetable species which would be
 
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:20.540 align:start position:0%
anything other than uh poultry uh beef
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh goat and sheep so what mostly Falls
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
onto this in our state is uh deer elk
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
and bison and it's more difficult for
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
these for people to get these animals
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
processed for a number of reasons and
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
this study committee would look at ways
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
of addressing that and also ways of
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
addressing our general uh the general
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
difficulty of getting Slaughter of
 
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.220 align:start position:0%
getting animals slaughtered and
 
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
processed in the state and I think it
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
makes sense to study it so
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and and there had been some question
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
about whether we should have three
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
senators and one rep on the on the bill
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
because it um uh because it's a Senate
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill and uh
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
have rethinking that I think
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
um will the study will probably get
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
better done done better if the Reps do
 
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:19.610 align:start position:0%
better done done better if the Reps do
it

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
I'll come twice thank you first off I
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
concur with our representative of Bixby
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that state last statement
 
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
and that state last statement
um

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
however I also think this is an
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
extremely important bill not only for
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
non amenable species but
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
um in lieu of everything that is going
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
on uh in the country and in the state
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
with the processing it might give us
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
some more insight into what we can do to
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
better serve the other uh animals that
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with for slaughtering
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative comtwa any
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Morse
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I was just curious if we
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
decided we were going to change the date
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
on line 31 from November 1st 2023 to
 
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
no well I think that there was some
 
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
discussion on that
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but but I believe we're going to
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
leave it at that
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
um and I actually did have a an
 
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:24.740 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted to switch it to be
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
three members of the Senate and one
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
member of the house but I also decided
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
that we should probably keep it as is
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if um
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
if there are any people from this
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
committee who would be willing to
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
volunteer to serve on that committee
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
be willing but I don't want it there's
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
not someone else I don't want to take up
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
an extra space
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay well I'll put down representative
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
Bixby and representative com12 for now
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
I wonder if it might be um a good idea
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
to invite someone from Fish and Game to
 
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
be on this committee oh yeah that's
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
probably good idea let me let me contact
 
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:24.260 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee and see if
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
they have somebody who might be willing
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
to serve because the thing is with these
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
study committees I know that the um the
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
house speaker is pretty overwhelmed with
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
many of these committees that are coming
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
out of these house bills
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
and he's very much appreciative if we
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
can suggest some names to him for people
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
to appoint to these committees so
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton uh and yes
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair just uh to representative
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
Morris's comment
 
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.220 align:start position:0%
um on the date so this thing gets signed
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh by the governor sometime June July
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
the committee forms August September and
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
the due date is November
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
is that enough time for them to do
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
I mean it basically gives me two months
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
to do the study by the time everything
 
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
to do the study by the time everything
gets

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah sure yeah I'm just asking so my
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
only thing is if you push it out to June
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of legislative
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
season January through June of next year
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
so really to have study committees going
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
on during that time is is awkward and
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense I mean we do we
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
usually schedule them mostly September
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
October to get it done I mean yeah so
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay all right if you think that that's
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
enough time to do it then you're on a
 
00:14:47.579 --> 00:15:00.470 align:start position:0%
enough time to do it then you're on a
committee

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative datsey uh yes um just for
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarification because I have some notes
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
here so the the members of the committee
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
shall be and is it going to be uh the
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
way it was originally drafted three
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
members of the house and one member of
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate that has not changed right oh
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
correct we would not be amending this
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative Howard
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just have one
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
um does this is this solely not
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendable I'm um
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh animal so a species or small farms
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
with okay thank you
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are we clear on that
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
everybody understand this bill and what
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and just uh to answer
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howard's other question
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
is hopefully with this study we can come
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and now we can move on to SB a
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on SB 159
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
which is establishing a committee
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
another committee to study unlimited
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
service area permits for landfills and
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste coming into New
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and again I would invite
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
anyone from this committee to volunteer
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
to serve on this committee
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
um the committee felt that this was an
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
important bill to take a look at to kind
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
of get a better understanding of what
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
what the true scope of unlimited service
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
area premature was with regard to
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
landfills and um
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
as you said yes another study committee
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
but I think when we're looking at Solid
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Waste in New Hampshire we know that
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
there are many different facets around
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
it and this is one that I think requires
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
study thank you and I did speak with
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative evil who is the chair of
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group and uh
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
asked her if they had any intention in
 
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:21.980 align:start position:0%
the near future or even farther future
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
to study
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
landfills uh you know the unlimited
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
service area permits and as well as
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
out of state waste and policies for
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste coming to the
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
landfills she said no they um that even
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
though this is a priority and something
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to look at
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are some other things on their
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
plate right now that um are taking
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
precedence so they don't think that she
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't think that they're going to get
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
to that within the next year so
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
seeing as this is an important issue
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
um it does
 
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.510 align:start position:0%
um it does
um

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
you know make sense for a a study
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee to be formed to to perform
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
this work
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
so the process for the three members of
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
the house that are chosen is by the
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
speaker so if one of the people on this
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
committee is interested how's that
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
process work so I I'm I have discussed
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
this with the house speaker and he said
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
if I had a list of names
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
um to provide to him that you know he
 
00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:37.010 align:start position:0%
um to provide to him that you know he
would

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
um Murray you had your hand raised
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
um yes so I think
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
I think uh I guess this is a question of
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
the chair then so if folks are
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
interested how do we do we express that
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
to you or the speaker's office or let me
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
know I'll write your name down now
 
00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:04.150 align:start position:0%
know I'll write your name down now
okay

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to be on it
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay so it looks like we have four
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
people who want to be on it which is a
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
little bit it's okay we can have more
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
names and we can have the
 
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
names and we can have the
um yeah

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the the speaker choose whoever I just
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
need to give him a list of names because
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
um you know he he's gotta make the
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
um oh and for anyone who doesn't end up
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
being one of the three people who
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
selected uh every anyone is welcome to
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
go to the to all of the study committee
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
meetings and participate fully so uh
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's your non-voting member as a
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
non-voting member right so uh so that's
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you you and people who are
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
participating as as sort of audience
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
members in the uh in the hearing
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
generally get a fair amount of input so
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else have comments or questions
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.650 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't see anybody you know any
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
amendments coming forward for this but
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
um with my discussions with
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
um this this is not an issue that
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be tackling anytime
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
soon so uh I I recommend that we
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
pass this representative Dotsy yeah uh
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
Madam chair just a question about
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
process if we are to attend those
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
meetings where is the meeting posted is
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
it in the calendar yes they would be
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
posted in the calendar
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
yeah any of this any of the study
 
00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:11.539 align:start position:0%
committees after they're formed uh and
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
they have an initial date that they meet
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
they choose a chair and a vice chair and
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
and someone to Clerk and then um
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
they that will you know they they can
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
they then decide the um schedule of
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
meetings and that's posted in the uh in
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
the calendar Jamie helps out with that
 
00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:39.909 align:start position:0%
the calendar Jamie helps out with that
yeah

00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
it would be entirely possible for uh
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
some member on this committee to just uh
 
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:48.620 align:start position:0%
email the entire committee saying as a
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
courtesy saying we're having a meeting
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
this week at such and such a time and
 
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
place so
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um it's so we can
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
people can be kept informed about when
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
the study committee's meetings are
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
happening except you don't happen to
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
pick up your calendar you can pick up
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
the you we can make sure it arrives in
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
the email
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we do have our committee researcher
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
Kristen Grant involved in the process
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
she is support for the committee and
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative NAB thank you madam chair
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
can I just ask procedurally is the
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
report language always the same for a
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
study committee and what is the process
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
by which we would review a report as our
 
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.169 align:start position:0%
by which we would review a report as our
committee

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
or take up recommendations
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
when the report comes out if our
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee is meeting and we have a work
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
session we can review the report and
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
discuss it sure and then if any ideas
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
come out of that for a proposed
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
legislation that's something else that
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
we would be involved in representative
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so typically a study
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
committee report will have a couple of
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
pages of findings uh phrased in a fairly
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
succinct way and then also have specific
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation although
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have the the verbiage but
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
typically not the verbiage for the
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
legislation but ideas about what should
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
go forward is legislation
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions about SB
 
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.950 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions about SB
159

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
159
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:36.620 align:start position:0%
um we'll move on now to SB 267
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
requiring the commissioner or Department
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services to consider
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts analysis in rules and
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
statutes representative Bixby okay so I
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on this just as a
 
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.529 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on this just as a
reminder

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:50.539 align:start position:0%
reminder
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts are so currently
 
00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:58.220 align:start position:0%
rules tend to go and tend to govern
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
emissions and affluence uh by the single
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
type of emission to replement so uh the
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
rules for
 
00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
rules for
um

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
for Benzene would be a certain amount of
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
benzene that could be emitted without
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
you you'd have to keep your Benzene
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
emissions below a certain amount but you
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
might have a different uh amount for
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
toluene and it doesn't really take into
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
account the toluene and Benzene might be
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
doing similar things biologically and
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
combined they might have a greater
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
impact than uh than they would
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
individually so that's one aspect of
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts the other is that
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
rules tend to deal with uh individual
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
sources so if you have one Factory that
 
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
is emitting maybe only a third of what
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
the of allowed level is but you have
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
three other factories on next door to it
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
that are also emitting about one-third
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the allowed level the allowed the
 
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
amount in the that immediate vicinity
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
becomes uh over the you know what would
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
be allowed because you have have four
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
different emitters that are emitting a
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
smaller amount and that's also one
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
um another aspect of cumulative impact
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
and uh when this this bill came to the
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
Senate there was a initially a bill that
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
went to the Senate saying that they
 
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:25.820 align:start position:0%
needed to take into account
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
that Des needed to take into account
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts Des said we don't
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to do that yet and uh
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate's response was well we'll
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
give you a position uh and that person
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
can uh study up on cumulative impacts
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
provide a report to uh uh and that
 
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.390 align:start position:0%
provide a report to uh uh and that
report

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
report
um

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
will the based on that report the
 
00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:57.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner can suggest legislation and
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh and that and that report would come
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
to us as a uh would would come to uh the
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house uh and uh so uh
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is all a very good idea of one of
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
the one there are three minor points
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
that I made an amendment for one is that
 
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.830 align:start position:0%
that I made an amendment for one is that
uh

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
when they uh when it was drafted it was
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
going to send the report to St e and to
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
resources but not to us so I asked so I
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
put us on the recipient list for the
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
report I also said uh changed the
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
reporting out date from November 1st uh
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
to September 1st because we typically
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
have our bill filing period at the
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
beginning of September so uh we would
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
want the report before we would
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
potentially be writing bills about it uh
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
and the third
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh the Third change is in line five uh
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
the initial the as written the bill said
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh to determine what rules are to
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
determine where it says what now it said
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
to determine if rules or legislations
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislation should be proposed and uh I
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
change that to what rules or legislation
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
because we expect there's going to be
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
some changes recommended out of this and
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that all that
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
information gets through gets completely
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the legislature so we have
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
a chance to review it and do uh any sort
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
of legislation that we need to in order
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
to address it
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh so uh I think these are pretty
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
um small changes and I hope everyone
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay representative Haskins thank you
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I support the amendment and I
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
particularly appreciate the fact that
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
it's going to come back to this
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
committee and I hope that's something
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
that we can consider in other bills we
 
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.789 align:start position:0%
that we can consider in other bills we
discuss

00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh do you feel that the changes in the
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
amendment mandate that a study will be
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
done or is it still at the discretion of
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I feel that that
 
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
I I feel that that
um as

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
um as
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh as amended this will make this will
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
require that the study be done and that
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that it'd be that the reports be
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
provided to the appropriate legislative
 
00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.390 align:start position:0%
provided to the appropriate legislative
committees

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I think by changing the word if to
 
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.769 align:start position:0%
um I think by changing the word if to
what

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh is substantial because if meant maybe
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
but what determine what rules it really
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
specifies that they have to do it
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments about
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
I want to thank representative Bixby for
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
submitting this and this is amendment
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
1685 H is it not yes we all have copies
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
of that representative germana
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted to I
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative comptwa
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
that I think that's a significant change
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
but it's one I support it it
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
specifically says any potential
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
legislation or rule making and the fact
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we do not currently have a process
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
to determine what happens when you know
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
multiple affluence or emissions meet in
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
a certain area I think makes it pretty
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
clear that something will come of this
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
so it isn't necessarily statute driven
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
it isn't necessarily legislation but I
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
think it's safe to say that since we're
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
currently not doing it that uh the the
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
report will result at least in some new
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
rule making so I think it is significant
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
but I think it is extremely important
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby I just
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
want to note that
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is also I worked with
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
with Senator alt Schiller on the
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
amendment and this is what we uh came up
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
with our discussions with each other
 
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.350 align:start position:0%
with our discussions with each other
mm-hmm

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank you representative
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
Bixby for putting this amendment
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
together it certainly improves the bill
 
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.370 align:start position:0%
together it certainly improves the bill
and

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
um puts some
 
00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:34.130 align:start position:0%
um puts some

some impactful
 
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.669 align:start position:0%
some impactful
um

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
language in it
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so I want to thank you for your work
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments or questions
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
regarding SB 267
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the fact that the changes
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.649 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:20.450 align:start position:0%
that
okay

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
moving on to SB 62 relative to landowner
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
liability under RSA 147b the Hazardous
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments regarding this
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so this was
 
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:45.860 align:start position:0%
another department request and
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
there were some drafting errors in
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation about a decade ago
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um plus or minus I'm not going to swear
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
to the exact timing but uh that needed
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
um fixed and there were also a number of
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
places where there were gender
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
references that made things specifically
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
male as opposed to
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
um being uh
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
on being Universal about gender and
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
those were also uh changed in order to
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
make sure may get clear that we're
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
talking about anyone of any gender
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
um is doing the things are you know meet
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
these requirements so
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
um that's uh so I think this this makes
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
sense and it's pretty much a nuts and
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
bolts bill
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay well and uh for me um it's not only
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
a matter of gender it just really
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies you know who they're talking
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
about rather than he or she it's the
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
owner or former owner
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you know of whatever parcel
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
land that they're discussing here so I
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
think that just that in itself really
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies the statute
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um one of the
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
other things that I think the department
 
00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:09.169 align:start position:0%
other things that I think the department
noticed

00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
noted problematic phrase substance I
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
believe it was referenced somewhere else
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
in statute and so by amending that
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
language we are taking the ambiguity out
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
of what is being referenced here
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
no no it's already there
 
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
yeah no there's no Amendment that's the
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
the bill itself yeah
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
amending the language correct
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
seeing none I know um it's not uh on the
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
list of things to discuss today but just
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
as a point of information I wanted to
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that HB 79 which
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
was a bill that we passed
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
which is again another study committee
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
which will
 
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.789 align:start position:0%
which will
um

00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh it was amended by our committee to
 
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.169 align:start position:0%
uh it was amended by our committee to
review

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.179 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 426 and RSA 434
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
those statutes are
 
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:20.780 align:start position:0%
um compatible
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
and that they are you know kind of
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
coordinating with each other and that
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
was made into a study committee so that
 
00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:30.139 align:start position:0%
bill was passed by the Senate
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
and um and I believe signed by the
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
governor too so yes yes so uh so the
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
upshot of that is that it says in the
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill that we need to have the
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting of the uh for the
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
committee within 45 days of the
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
signature which means we need to get uh
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
some volunteers yeah so I I know that
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
you have stepped forward for that yeah I
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
did as well
 
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:02.660 align:start position:0%
um so oh we need one more volunteer okay
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
and representative Creighton said he
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay so we got that one covered
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
all right good
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
so now we uh turn our attention to the
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh I want to say the 800 pound gorilla
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
in the room which is SB 61. uh relative
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
to surface water setbacks for landfills
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
now I know we've got a lot of comment to
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
say on this particular bill
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
before we get started
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just say that I want to make
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
sure that our discussions
 
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:55.250 align:start position:0%
sure that our discussions
are

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
discussions that
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
place any kind of motives or aspersions
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
or caste dispersions on any people or
 
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:10.700 align:start position:0%
organizations or businesses
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is about how we are going to
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
move forward when we have to
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
um amend the rules that we're currently
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
working on working under or that Des
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
Works under when citing landfills so
 
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.870 align:start position:0%
Works under when citing landfills so
um

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to open up the
 
00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:37.370 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to open up the
discussion

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to ask if we could
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
because there's so much to discuss could
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
we maybe go paragraph by paragraph
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes sir representative could
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
I suggest
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
um before we go into it
 
00:37:01.859 --> 00:37:02.690 align:start position:0%
um before we go into it
um

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
a paragraph by paragraph I'd just like
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
to to make a few points in terms of you
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
know just pointing out where some of the
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
the key areas of of
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
um contention are sure and then uh and
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
then we can go into a um a more
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
systematic discussion let's be my guess
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
so the I think the probably the biggest
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
sticking point uh is the idea of
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
reversion uh which is that uh if the
 
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:32.450 align:start position:0%
reversion uh which is that uh if the
um

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
if the rules are not finished within 24
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
months uh then the uh then permits can
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
be issued under the existing rules and
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh that is something that um
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
there uh some people find that really
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and some people find it
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary and that's going to
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
be difficult not to crack uh and we can
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
discuss that more in more detail as it
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
as it comes up uh there's
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
um there's been a num a lot of
 
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
um there's been a num a lot of
um

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
requests from a number of different
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
areas for a clear conflict of interest
 
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:14.660 align:start position:0%
statement and
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh there is not uh actually a template
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
for this at DES but they do have within
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
their rules uh standards of conduct for
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
engineers and geologists uh and uh
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
um the impression I have gotten is that
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be a lot of
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
resistance to having in the bill a clear
 
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:38.579 align:start position:0%
a clearer statement of conflict of
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
interest in of What conflict of interest
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
language should go into the RFP
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so that might be a less difficult not
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
to crack uh one another issue that's
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
been raised is whether 150 000 is is
 
00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:55.579 align:start position:0%
enough to attract a qualified consultant
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
and uh this uh one approach to that
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
would be that uh if that's not enough
 
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.849 align:start position:0%
would be that uh if that's not enough
then

00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
um the department can approach the
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee for more it also may be
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
possible to put language into the bill
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting that although it wouldn't be
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to authorize it uh
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
and uh then uh there have also been
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
suggestions about technical technical
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
specifications and that's something we
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
can get to as we're going through line
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
by line and um
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
so that that's my general and and the
 
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.510 align:start position:0%
so that that's my general and and the
the

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
um this discussion points sheet that I
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
sent that I passed around is really I'm
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
not trying to push any particular point
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
of view I'm just saying this is some of
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's out there and uh so
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
that we can just get stuff on the table
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
okay and thank you for for outlining
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
some of the things at least that you see
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
um that need amending I I just want to
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
make clear that since there is some work
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
that we feel that needs to be done on
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill even though it is
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
set as scheduled uh to be exact this
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon it will not be because we
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not ready for prime time as
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
they say we don't have an any
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
um definite amendment in hand that we
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
can deal with so
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so we will not be executing this bill
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and we will schedule it
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
for another time
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
NAB you had your hand up
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I was just going to add to Peter's
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
list to representative bixby's list
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're reporting out of the findings as
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
a discussion point
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
I thought that was also a sticking point
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm if I'm wrong I apologize but I
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh represent Potenza
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to second that
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
um the findings as well as
 
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.050 align:start position:0%
um the findings as well as
um

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
the dates I think are a sticking point
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
as well that we need to talk about
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the 24 months and if it's
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
not there in 24 months you know due to
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
if there's something that happens so
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
um in permitting I think is extremely
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
important as well that there are no
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
permits that are done until these new
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
the findings are in place and we have
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
new rules adopted
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative Murray yeah
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to add that portion to the
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
sort of topics of things to discuss I
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
agree that I think we could probably add
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
the report out to include
 
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.290 align:start position:0%
the report out to include
um

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that that isn't terribly
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
onerous task to see the committee on our
 
00:41:58.619 --> 00:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
onerous task to see the committee on our
report

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
um that said I I would like to see if we
 
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.670 align:start position:0%
um that said I I would like to see if we
can

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
go sort of uh to make sure we're not
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
missing any finer points uh and that is
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we'll definitely get there to
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative patenda and
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative um nam's points I think
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
that those are well okay thank you
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just have one
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
question that I think will be answered
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the course of going paragraph by
 
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
paragraph but
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering why we have a two-year
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
limit at all
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
um what we've been informed that I think
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have at least 24 years before we need
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
a new landfill
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
um before the need arises so why are we
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
setting a timeline
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
well that's something that we can
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
discuss but certainly that's a point
 
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
that the Senate felt very strongly about
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
and they reached their consensus for
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
that particular time period
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's their bill so that's what
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
um do we want we we want to proceed
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
um excuse me thank you as we go through
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
this I think if we talk about the
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
sections so that we do you know each
 
00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
section at a time and that we State what
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
section we're going through just so
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
everyone's on the same page I think is
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
extremely important right so we'll begin
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
with um the first paragraph which is the
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose uh lines one
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
any questions comments about that
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I think that the um
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty comfortable with a statement
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
of purpose I I think that uh I like the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know I like the fact that it
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
um recognizes the need for redundant
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
protection I like the fact that
 
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.710 align:start position:0%
protection I like the fact that
um

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:18.740 align:start position:0%
there are that it um
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
emphasizes the idea of site-specific
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
requirements because it incites you know
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
are you know fairly variable and there
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
need to be requirements that that deal
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
with that so I don't see any I don't see
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
any problems with the statement of
 
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.150 align:start position:0%
any problems with the statement of
purpose

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton yeah yes Madam
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair what I noticed on that and it's
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
just before the mention of site-specific
 
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
just before the mention of site-specific
requirements

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
is it's the whole concept of the bill in
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
general is to re-examine how we do this
 
00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:55.700 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
identifying distances the the rate at
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
which water travels the soil conditions
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
all of those are inherent
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the description of the statement of
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
the purpose
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so as you get into the bill what
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
we've told them is to figure out what
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
these specifics are not to define those
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
specifics and something you don't tell
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
someone to do something then tell them
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
what it is that you just so what we're
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing is tell them to go do it so go do
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
your work and then come back and tell us
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
what those specifics are and and a lot
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the discussion and emails I've gotten
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of days have said
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
you know well you need to be specific in
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
the bill I completely disagree with that
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to be directive in
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
go go do your work and come back and
 
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:43.220 align:start position:0%
tell us scientifically what those
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
specifics are and I just wanted it says
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
it straight right right in the statement
 
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
of purpose and given that the I guess
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
the Des rules expire next year
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
um then you know it may this makes
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
perfect sense and perfect timing uh this
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
is a very timely Bill
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
to direct uh how how those new citing
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
rules can be developed
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative Nam
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
a question about line
 
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
um 15 and 16 if they are timely adopted
 
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:21.980 align:start position:0%
and what them
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
meaning of that language is and if it's
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
if it's problematic at all in terms of
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
adoption of new rules and permitting of
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe they are
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
problematic okay I don't I don't think
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
so I mean the ACT also sets a time frame
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the Department's attached adoption
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
of new setback rules and requires that
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
any newly cited landfill Premier
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
permitted after the effective date
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
comply with the new rules if they are
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
timely adopted if they are timely
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
adopted as provided in this act so
 
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.490 align:start position:0%
adopted as provided in this act so
representative

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I am looking at
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
one thing and it says here
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
um based on what representative
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Creighton just said it says the ACT also
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
sets a time frame for the Department's
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
adoption of new setback rules and
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
requires that any newly cited landfill
 
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
permitted after the effect of day comply
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
the thing is is we're saying that the
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
setback rules now are are no good
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
because we're telling them that they
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
have to come up with new setback rules
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
and so isn't that telling them what to
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
they're already going to be doing
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
instead of having them look at
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
everything scientifically
 
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:40.370 align:start position:0%
just asking the question
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.589 align:start position:0%
just asking the question
[Music]

00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
I agree with that I think it should just
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
say new sites we're all talking about
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
how everything is supposed to be site
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
specific so if we have to put anything
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
in front of it it should be site
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
specific or not put anything in front of
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
it all and just say new rules and I
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
believe that that whole line should read
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
the ACT also sets a time frame for the
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
Department's adoption of new rules and
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
requires that any newly cited landfill
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
permitted and then Wipe Out the rest
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
permitted comply with the new rules as
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
provided in this act we don't need any
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
anything else in there that talks about
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
time the rest that's talked about time
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
will be outlined in the rest of the bill
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so uh one thing
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's important to know about
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
um both the uh the purpose and the
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose and the findings is
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
that uh they don't carry the same weight
 
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
of requirement that the rest of the bill
 
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.190 align:start position:0%
of requirement that the rest of the bill
does

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
so uh they don't become part of Statute
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
law uh and
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh they are basically uh outlaying the
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
general idea I am concerned that if we
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
do wordsmithing of every little bit then
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
that's going to raise red flags that
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
might uh make it less likely that the
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
other body would concur with this uh and
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
make it less likely that it gets signed
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
into law and I want to avoid anything
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
that uh is going to raise red flags
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
unless it's something that is really
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
critical for how the bill is going to
 
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
critical for how the bill is going to
work

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.089 align:start position:0%
work
Creighton

00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am I would just
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
like to pile on representative Bixby at
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I think people agree
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
that this has got to pass at the end of
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
the day whatever we do here this we want
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
all of us want this to pass
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
and so I think looking at it from a
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
practical perspective of what we believe
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
will pass
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
and it's a matter of picking your fights
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that in this case this
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
verbiage I I agree with you completely
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
that it does allow the wiggle room if in
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
I agree completely with that but to to
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's perspective and I
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
agree with him completely is that if we
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
make a hundred thousand changes to this
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we redo the whole thing then we have
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
abjectly failed because the Senate will
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
say thank you but no
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
and so I think we do have to be very
 
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.790 align:start position:0%
and so I think we do have to be very
careful

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
careful
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
in that those things that we believe
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
need to be changed and I think we agree
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
on what needs to be changed that we
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
stick to that and that we do we do a
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
careful analysis and representative
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
Bixby and the chair chairman of
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
done coordination with the Senate so
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
they understand the specifics of what
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
probably will and probably won't pass
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
and I overstated my point but I agree
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
with both of you I do believe that this
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
is one case where we just choose not to
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
fight that fight right now and pick a
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
better place to fight
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.190 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
chair

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
um with respect I don't think any of us
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
wants to dissect it change it make you
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
know a dozen different changes but I
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
think there are two or three things that
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
matter greatly and I'm not yet aware
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we've reached agreement on them so
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
I think that's where the discussion
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I want to see
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
first of all with regard to the point
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
about the fact that this statement of
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
purpose instructs the department to
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
adopt new setback rules I I think it's
 
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
clear that both the Senate and this
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
Committee in the in the house having
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
heard from a lot of experts have
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
concluded that new setback rules do in
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
fact need to be uh
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
need to be developed so I think that is
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense in terms of the
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
statement of the purpose we're asking
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
them to set the new rules based upon the
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
the scientific analysis that they're
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to be doing and then also I just
 
00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:07.099 align:start position:0%
want to clarify I believe that the the
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
Clause if they are timely adopted is
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
provided by this act defense essentially
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
refers to the reversion to Old rules in
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
the case that Des does not
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
finish the process right because the
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
they in that Clause refers back to New
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
setback rules so I just wanted to
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
clarify the meaning of that term
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
referred specifically to
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
an event where Des does not complete the
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
assigned work within the 24-month period
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just to just to
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
revert back to representative
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
Creighton's original
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
um a statement about not wanting to be
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
too prescriptive I agree with that I
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
think that there are there are going to
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
be moments when we do have when we do
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
have to make some substantial changes
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
but along the way
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
being you know the technical things and
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
all that being too prescriptive I think
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
is going to negate the passing of this
 
00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:11.690 align:start position:0%
is going to negate the passing of this
bill

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
I guess we can
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
we can then move on to the findings
 
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.270 align:start position:0%
we can then move on to the findings
section

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions about
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby
 
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.290 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby
um

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
I am also good with the findings section
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
I think that uh it uh does in fact uh
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
indicate that the 200 foot setbacks
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and that uh replacing
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
it with a site-specific setback is
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
important it also emphasizes the
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
importance of redundancy uh and uh so I
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
um I I don't find anything that is
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
anything problematic in the in the
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
finding section and I I'd be I think we
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so do you want to skip to
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
section three the new paragraph rule
 
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.730 align:start position:0%
section three the new paragraph rule
making

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and that's lines that's page two
 
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments about the
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking paragraph
 
00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:39.500 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 149 M Collins colon seven
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
by inserting paragraph three the
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
following new paragraph
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
criteria for determining site-specific
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
setback of landfill footprint from
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
perennial surface water bodies
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
to prevent attenuate or otherwise
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
remediate the potential release of
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants to each such surface water
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
body from the landfill footprint and so
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
forth any other any questions or
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
comments about that section represent
 
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.450 align:start position:0%
comments about that section represent
Bixby

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so um at one point I was thinking
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:10.370 align:start position:0%
yeah so um at one point I was thinking
about

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
it says uh the department no line 23 uh
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
the department deems uh any other Factor
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
the department Department deems
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
necessary uh to provide adequate
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
protection of surface water perennial
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
surface water uh I at one point was
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
thinking that you know that's a kind of
 
00:55:35.049 --> 00:55:35.059 align:start position:0%
roundabout way of just saying protect
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
and uh thought that maybe we should
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
change that but going on the going on
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
the principle that I mentioned earlier
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to make any changes
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
that aren't really necessary uh and
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
would create red flags I think that we
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
should just leave that as is uh I it
 
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
basically means the same thing even if
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
it spends another four words to say it
 
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
it spends another four words to say it
okay

00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is the section that gets into the
 
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
this is the section that gets into the
science

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.130 align:start position:0%
science
and

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
um this is where I'd like to hear from
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
one of the scientists who does this work
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
and knows it better than I do would that
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
don't know don't
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
I mean this is a work session for the
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee I just again this this section
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
I think is important for us to
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
understand the science and if we can
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
have that explained more explicitly it
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to me
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Contour
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think um
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
because right now we're under rulemaking
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if um
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
if I guess unless we had the department
 
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.430 align:start position:0%
if I guess unless we had the department
of

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:51.980 align:start position:0%
uh well perhaps
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
because when we get into like
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
site-specific perennial service order in
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
those sections I think that's where you
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
get into the really the science stuff
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
regarding this section
 
00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:10.970 align:start position:0%
regarding this section
okay

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.630 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
then we're looking at section four
 
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:20.300 align:start position:0%
which is page two lines 33 to 37.
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
and that section discusses
 
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.410 align:start position:0%
and that section discusses
um

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:32.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
site-specific set new paragraph for
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
site-specific setback to Perennial
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
surface water
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
which amends RSA 149 Dash M colon 9. by
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
inserting after paragraph 14 the
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
following new paragraph This regards to
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
its own in regards to formulating a
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
site-specific setback
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
to Perennial surface water under rules
 
00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.829 align:start position:0%
to Perennial surface water under rules
adopted

00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.690 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
yeah

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
can somebody explain to me what
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
um lines 23 24 and 25 what that sentence
 
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
um lines 23 24 and 25 what that sentence
means

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah the department shall include as a
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
condition to any permit the
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
implementation of a measure proposed in
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
the application for the permit upon
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
which the department relied in
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
formulating the site-specific setback
 
00:58:36.059 --> 00:58:38.089 align:start position:0%
formulating the site-specific setback
required

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it hold on representative
 
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.030 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it hold on representative
Howard

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me as if they are they're
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
they're as part of the agreement to put
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the landfill they are conditions that
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are in the contract that are
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
separate from what that are that sound
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
as if they might be separate from the
 
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.490 align:start position:0%
as if they might be separate from the
rules

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative germana uh thank you
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair as I read this in reference
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
to the points one through eight above so
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
concludes right what the contract in
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
permitting is in this case if any of
 
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
permitting is in this case if any of
these

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh measures are put in place that
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
measure is included in the contract that
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
is drawn up for the permit right so if
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the recipient of the permit agrees
 
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
to uh you know Point number five for
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
example and increasing the thickness of
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
the liner as a part of their
 
00:59:42.599 --> 00:59:44.270 align:start position:0%
the liner as a part of their
site-specific

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
site-specific
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
work with Des that would be then
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
included in the contract that is drawn
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
up with Des that's how I read that uh
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
that section uh representative Creighton
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'll just frame it another way in my
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
mind some worries better I probably want
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
the words this way but if you make a
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
ruling you got to tell the people why
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
you made a ruling but that's the way I
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
read that and
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Etsy
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah then I would suggest that maybe we
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
make that clarification I mean I know
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
about word smithing but I've just read
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
that over and over again and I couldn't
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
figure it out so maybe we do need to
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
I agree that that is not uh the clearest
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
of language and
 
01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:39.650 align:start position:0%
of language and
um

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
I I think that what I'd like to do with
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:45.530 align:start position:0%
that is
um

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
see if we can make sure that uh see if
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
we can get clarifying language and I'd
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
like to work with one of the Senators on
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that uh whatever
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying languages be language we come
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
up with really is
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
truly matching their intent uh because I
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
I don't want this to come off as being
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
us just sort of doing grammatical
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
correction on the senate for the sake of
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
being the school mom I want I want to
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that we actually are um
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
getting it clarified in a way that they
 
01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:26.579 align:start position:0%
would agree with and I'd I'd uh so
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
um I will talk with members of the
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
senate committee about this and see if
 
01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:33.380 align:start position:0%
we can come up with a somewhat clearer
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
and clearer language so that it's not it
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't become something that's looked
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
at as ambiguous in some lawsuit at some
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
point I concur with that representative
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
Haskins yeah I think we've heard
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are a number of um
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
scientific flaws in the sections three
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
four and five and that's why I was
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
hoping we could get
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
some help with that since we have people
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that would add to the discussion
 
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.910 align:start position:0%
and that would add to the discussion
that

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has with the Senate
 
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.670 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has with the Senate
okay

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton the one thing
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.470 align:start position:0%
that I think
um

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
helps us out with that is
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
on line two where it says without
 
01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
on line two where it says without
limitations

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
so this is a suggested
 
01:02:32.579 --> 01:02:34.010 align:start position:0%
so this is a suggested
topics

01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
topics
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
to consider you don't have to consider
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
all of them but if something's missed in
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
you sorry if something's missed in here
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
then by all means add it so this is is
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
I agree with that and I understand where
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
you're coming from because this list
 
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
could be exhaustive it could go for
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
pages and pages
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
I think I would have rathered there to
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
be just some generalities in here
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
instead of getting they got really
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
specific right they probably shouldn't
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
have it should have been more General
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
because that's the whole point of us
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
Contracting out so
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I think at the top the without
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
limitation is protective for that
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
um even if some of these things here
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
might not be accurate
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
well I I think you're absolutely right
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
and it would be a huge huge list I'm I'm
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
happy to see some um
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
some really good examples though
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um showcased here so this is this is a a
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
good list to start from
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I just want to Concur and say
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
that I see this as being comparable to
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
or parallel to a section in in HB 56
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
which the bill which a lot of us really
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
liked for example the project
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowances
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
right one or more specific allowances
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to 56 now may be added to
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
the calculated time based on specific
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
additional control technology monitoring
 
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:13.609 align:start position:0%
additional control technology monitoring
programs

01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
Etc and so I see this list which is as
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton and
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza pointed out is
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
not it is without limitation so this is
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
a I I see it as being comparable to or
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
parallel to that section of of HB 56.
 
01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:32.329 align:start position:0%
parallel to that section of of HB 56.
okay

01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:32.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments on this
 
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments on this
section

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay we can move along to section five
 
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:40.730 align:start position:0%
okay we can move along to section five
um

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
which is Page Three uh line 26 going to
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
page four up to line 18 having to do
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Environmental
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
Services Solid Waste landfill setback
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements assessment and
 
01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
requirements assessment and
recommendations

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh do we have any comments or questions
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
on this particular section
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
this is having to do with
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
um Department of Environmental Services
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
Contracting with one or more qualified
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
consulting firms or individuals
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
to perform an assessment of the current
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
perennial surface water protection and
 
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:21.059 align:start position:0%
setback requirements that are applicable
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the permitting of newly cited Solid
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
Waste landfills in order to meet the
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
requirements of sections three and four
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes so um this is a
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
section where we might want to add more
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
specific language about conflicts of
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
interests because this is the the
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest language should be
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
something that is included within the uh
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
the RFP
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
or the requests for proposals so
 
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.530 align:start position:0%
or the requests for proposals so
um

01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:56.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
so iPad I passed around a sheet that has
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
um it says Bixby five nine at the top
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
and this is this is basically the last
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
two pages of the bill with a couple of
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
amendments that I'm suggesting uh and
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's the one that says surf that has the
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
word service water at the very top uh if
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
you go down to
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
um uh Roman uh one uh
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
um then um
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
I I would there's some language I I'm
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting putting in uh so
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
um the draft request shall require each
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
proposal to provide a statement of any
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
potential conflicts of interest with any
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
entity that may benefit from any change
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
in setback requirements indicating that
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
preference the preference will be given
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
to bidders without such conflict of
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
interest or to bidders with the fewest
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
01:06:50.529 --> 01:06:50.539 align:start position:0%
the draft
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
qualify the draft request will also
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
indicate that preference will be given
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
to proposals which demonstrate that the
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
qualified consulting firms or
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
individuals have credentials and
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
experience in evaluating the health and
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
safety risks associated with
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection as well as the
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
engineering and hydro hydrological
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
aspects of landfill design and sighting
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's I think that
 
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:19.220 align:start position:0%
um will
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
give the
 
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
still give the department a lot of
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
latitude in terms of the selection they
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
make but will provide some sort of uh
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
indication of what the legislature
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
thinks is you know appropriate for the
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
selection process
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I wonder if the
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
phrase bitters with the fewest conflicts
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
of interest doesn't undercut the
 
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.410 align:start position:0%
of interest doesn't undercut the
statement

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think that representative Bixby yeah I
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
I think that uh depending on how one
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
measures conflicts of interest it may in
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
fact be impossible to get someone who
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
has absolutely no interest whatsoever uh
 
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:13.700 align:start position:0%
to uh because there are
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
there are you know a finite number of
 
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:19.940 align:start position:0%
firms uh in the Northeast that would be
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
uh probably likely to bid on this and uh
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
it is likely that some of them have done
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
work at some point or other in their uh
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
um history as a business with some uh
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
some of the entities involved here and
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
we we so we may not be able to find
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
someone who has the you know absolutely
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
no shred of potential conflict of
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
interest uh so uh that's why I put in
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the phrase
 
01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:53.420 align:start position:0%
um a fewest as opposed to absolutely not
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton uh thanks ma'am
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it's a pretty small
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
community a pool of folks the question
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
for uh representative Bixby did did you
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
run this by the
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
Senate I agree with the verbiage
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
um we had talked last week about
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
potentially extracting an existing
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
document right so I
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I so uh there there so
 
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
um I so uh there there so
um

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
it turns out there is not a dra there is
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
not a template within the in the
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
department of uh
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
environmental services for the conflict
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
of interest I do have
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
um uh standard code of ethics for
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
engineers and geologists that does
 
01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.729 align:start position:0%
engineers and geologists that does
reference

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
um conflicts of interest I have not run
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
this by the Senate yet I haven't run it
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
by uh others other stakeholders and that
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
um would need to happen before we you
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
finalize this I just wanted I wanted the
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee to have a you know to to have
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
a look at it and uh yeah and before I
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
you brought it to other people to see if
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's any if any other changes that
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
the committee felt needed to happen
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
before we brought it um
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
I actually think this language
 
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
I actually think this language
um

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
says what it needs to say about conflict
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
of interest and and also
 
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
of interest and and also
um

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
brings into
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
view the fact that yeah we are we do
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
have a limited number of people who
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
would bid on something like this and you
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
don't want to eliminate all of them
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
so it this this makes sense to me it's
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's well worded in the sense of
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
um in about a conflict of interest but
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
we're not defining what a conflict of
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
interest is so that's leaving that up to
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of the department
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
that's going to pick it so I know that
 
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.350 align:start position:0%
that's going to pick it so I know that
the

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
what I wrote
 
01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.729 align:start position:0%
what I wrote
is

01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
quite strict probably and needs some
 
01:11:16.199 --> 01:11:16.970 align:start position:0%
quite strict probably and needs some
work

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
but if you can't Define it in saying
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
what the conflict of interest is so for
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
example you have someone that's bidding
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
on it that wants a permit
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that have been that has been trying
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
to permit a landfill in New Hampshire
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
and they're bidding on this that's
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
obviously a conflict they want to get
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
the next contract real contract where
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
the big money is so I think that we have
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
to specifically put some stuff in there
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's that defines what the conflict of
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
interest could potentially be and have
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
them spell that out so we know that
 
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.410 align:start position:0%
them spell that out so we know that
history

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
I mean how to me there's no other way
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you madam chair I so
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
I had done a little bit of of
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
researching and while I understand that
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
there might not be any
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.649 align:start position:0%
anything to
um

01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
this within Des I did find something
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
referenced in administrative rules
 
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.050 align:start position:0%
referenced in administrative rules
around

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um third party
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
um accreditation and that's with regard
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
to Laboratories and there was a conflict
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
of interest statement there
 
01:12:23.159 --> 01:12:24.110 align:start position:0%
of interest statement there
um

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
so I was curious to know it reads um
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of that it
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that all current or former
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
relationships associations or
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
Investments that may influence or appear
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
to influence judgment discretion or
 
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.990 align:start position:0%
to influence judgment discretion or
impartiality

01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
impartiality
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh for Laboratories applying to or
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
accredited to the program have been
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed and then it continues on so
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
there are there there is something out
 
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:47.930 align:start position:0%
there are there there is something out
there

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.070 align:start position:0%
there
um

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
suitable to be changed or included it
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
looks like this is in
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and that's applications for initial or
 
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
renewal approval of tpaos
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so third parties okay uh
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes also for the
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
for the sake of um
 
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh well so uh in the Des
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
um uh conduct uh code of conduct for
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
engineers uh
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
the the language reads as follows the
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
professional engineer shall avoid
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest as follows one
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
promptly informed his employer or client
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
of any business
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
association's interests or circumstances
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
which could influence his or her
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
judgment or the quality of his or her
 
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.410 align:start position:0%
judgment or the quality of his or her
services

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:50.420 align:start position:0%

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
to not accept compensation Financial or
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise from more than one party for
 
01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
services pertaining to the same project
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
unless the circumstances are fully
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
disclosed to and agreed to by all
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
interested parties three
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
not solicit or accept Financial or other
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
for not solicit or accept gratuities
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%

for which
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
and he or she is responsible
 
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.250 align:start position:0%
and he or she is responsible
um

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
five when the pub when in public service
 
01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
as a member advisor or employee of a
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
governmental body or Department not
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
participate in considerations or actions
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
with respect to Services provided by his
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
or her
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
organization uh in private engineering
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
practices and six not solicit or accept
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
engineering and Engineering contracts
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
from a governmental body on which the
 
01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:57.500 align:start position:0%
principal or officer from his or her
 
01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
organization serves as a member so
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's what's currently
 
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:03.530 align:start position:0%
that's what's currently
um

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh in the administrative rules regarding
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards it's the
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
basically the equivalent language for
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
geologists as engineers
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
while we're talking about conflict of
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
interest I'm just curious
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
um if when we do that and I know we're
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
just talking basically about the
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services but
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
does this take into account the
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
executive branch that actually approve
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby uh that I'm not
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
quite so you mean does does that code of
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
conduct also apply to everyone in Des or
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the executive branch
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
correct uh that is something that I
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
don't technically know uh I we might be
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
able to get uh someone from the
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
Department to uh explain what they have
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
for their internal uh code of um of uh
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.719 --> 01:16:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative.c

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative.c
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's it seems to
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
me like this is out of the scope of our
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse and maybe she'd be tossed
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
over to research or OLS I find it hard
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to believe that there are no States in
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
this nation that have not had this same
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
problem and if we did research on that
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
we might be able to come up with the
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate wording that have been used
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair I like that suggestion by
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy I also picked up on
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
the word disclosure
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that should be inserted
 
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.930 align:start position:0%
and I think that should be inserted
somewhere

01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
well we do have our committee researcher
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.689 align:start position:0%
in the room
so

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:05.699 --> 01:17:06.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a question that we could
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
throw your way
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
and take a look at for us
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bixby so not only
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
might other states have this but we
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
might have it in some other context
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
so there there's probably some some uh
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
language out within our current laws
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
somewhere that deals with
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
um uh with uh addressing conflicts of
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
interest uh on contract on rfps and
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
um you know wherever that may be
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
as well as a definition of What conflict
 
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
I agree I think disclosure is really
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
important so if we are if we have a
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
statement of a conflict of interest and
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
we're act and we're asking these people
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
that are interested in putting in a
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
proposal or having this contract as long
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
as they're stating whatever is maybe
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's a known or perceived conflict of
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
interest that also it just lays it down
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
on the table as well so the less of
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
those the better of course so I know
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that there's not
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
um necessarily a lot of entities to do
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
this kind of work and we might have slim
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
pickings so we I knew I know we need to
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
be sensitive of that but in specifically
 
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.729 align:start position:0%
be sensitive of that but in specifically
listing

01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
listing
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
what those could possibly be like I had
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
written out and telling those people
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they need to disclose that if they
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
are going to bid then I don't I don't I
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't think we need a lot of research
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
for that and if we want to use some of
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
the specific statute language that's
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
already in place that has been used
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
um any other questions or comments
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Knapp I just
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
had a question about the bidding process
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
what happens if only one I'm sorry I
 
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
meant section five sorry yeah okay I'm
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
sorry if only one contractor submits a
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
response to the request per proposal
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me say that again I just had a
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
question about the process around the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
request for proposal if only one
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
contractor submits a bid or if there's
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
zero contractors that submits the bid is
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
that anything that's within our scope or
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
is that really a response from Des no
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
not not that that would be um
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah the executive would take care of
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
represent Potenza
 
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
before we're done with five
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
don't I think that this besides having
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
the conflict of interest in there
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't we in this area where we're
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
telling them
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know under a b c and d shouldn't
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
we put the experience in there as well
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
what experience that we feel
 
01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
what experience that we feel
um

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
the provider that's chosen should have
 
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.669 align:start position:0%
the provider that's chosen should have
representative

01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
I would defer to Des for experience
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
because none of us here
 
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.209 align:start position:0%
because none of us here
um

01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
are experts in that area
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I think they know what they're
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
looking for in a contractor more so than
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
we could ever
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't want to spell that out
 
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you I I
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
think if if in the language that
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is provided
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
you know we are giving them the the word
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
qualified and I think that I'm looking
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
for the specific language here but has
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.430 align:start position:0%
to do
um

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate qualified consultant
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
confirms uh experience in evaluating
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
health and safety risks associated with
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection as well as the
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
engineering and hydrogeological aspects
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's precisely why we want them to do
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
this is because we are concerned with
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
the health and safety risks associated
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
with Environmental Protection so I don't
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
think it's inappropriate at all for us
 
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.770 align:start position:0%
think it's inappropriate at all for us
to

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:23.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
specify what we mean by qualified in in
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
you know I like the language that
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has offered to do
 
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.410 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has offered to do
that

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
represent Potenza
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's exactly I have some bullet points
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
that that go from that too I think you
 
01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
actually have to define the term what
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
qualified means so
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
um at least you know direct and relevant
 
01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:54.140 align:start position:0%
professional experience in geologic and
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions similar to
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
those that are found in New Hampshire
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
direct and relevant experience in
 
01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:01.940 align:start position:0%
environmental and health risk management
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
at least those two bullets
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
so uh representative pretended just to
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
um in your page that you spelled out in
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
experience under that paragraph you are
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
just talking about those first two
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
bullet points yes
 
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.229 align:start position:0%
bullet points yes
okay

01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
I that's why I wrote should be outlined
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill reflecting something similar
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
as listed below yeah
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
I know we can't put anything I do like
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
direct and relevant professional
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
experience in groundwater flow and
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
contaminant transport modeling in soil
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
saturated unsaturated conditions and in
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
Bedrock including highly fractured Rock
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's just because I've been
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
researching so
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
um what these people do and I'm in no
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
way am an expert on all of this but um
 
01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
the research on it is is pretty clear
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
what these what a company needs to have
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really important that
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
not one company is going to have all of
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
this so we can talk about dates and
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
costs we're going to get into that but
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just one contractor
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
most contractors just in the nature of
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
this and I have experience in this are
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
not going to have all of the tools in
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
the toolbox they're going to subcontract
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
pieces of this out with relationships
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
that they currently have which will
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
still apply with the conflict of
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
interest and all of that so it's really
 
01:23:58.689 --> 01:23:58.699 align:start position:0%
important that it's not
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
whoever is hired for this or whoever's
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
putting a proposal in is not going to
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have all of those people
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
right on staff a lot of these people are
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
Okay I uh my my concern would be
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
um that those that list of if if we make
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
this so
 
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
this so
um

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
definitive like this
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
will we be limiting that the pool of
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
applicants based on as well as the
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
number of contractors they may
 
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.020 align:start position:0%
subcontract out to because
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
let's face it there's there's probably
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
um many of these contractors and
 
01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.990 align:start position:0%
um many of these contractors and
subcontractors

01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractors
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
who may end up having some kind of
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest at some point and
 
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.709 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest at some point and
um

01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just hesitate to be so
 
01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.050 align:start position:0%
I just hesitate to be so
um

01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.550 align:start position:0%
um
specific

01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.209 align:start position:0%
that it
would

01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:11.219 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
negate many of the people who might
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
be very good at what they do
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
and prevent them from participating in
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
in doing these and doing the study
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I I concur
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
with what representative Aaron is saying
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
I think that uh if we make it too
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
specific uh there are there are two
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
risks one is that it's going to make the
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
the burden of uh making sure that every
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
bit of language is is followed by Des is
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
um is absolutely you know on spot on
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to make that it's going to
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
make the process much more difficult uh
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
but we one of the things that we we have
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
to recognize is that Des has been
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
working in this area for decades and uh
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
we might not agree with everything the
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
department has ever done uh but we do
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
have to recognize that they do have a
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
certain level of expertise and we need
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
to trust that level of expertise uh
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones who are going
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be performing this work and if we
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
provide General guidelines like like
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
I've laid out in my uh in in the post
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
language here uh which by the way I'm
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
not you I don't have any ego in this I I
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
if if people want to change it that's
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
fine but I want to make sure that we
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
make retain it as being sufficiently
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
General that Des can use their expertise
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're fitting the
 
01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:48.050 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're fitting the
language

01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:51.020 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
regarding the process if we have
 
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
research research this whole issue and
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
maybe come back with a couple of
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
statements uh at that point we will be
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
doing another work session or we will be
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
able to look at at the amendment and
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we meet our
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
criteria is that correct
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry say that again well I mean
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
I thought we had made the decision to
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
throw this over to research and now what
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is that we're trying to come
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
up with a definition of conflict of
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
interest so if we do throw this over to
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
research to research what's been done in
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Across the Nation
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
when that information comes back won't
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
we have time then to determine if that
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
meets our criteria for conflict of
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
interest so why are we wordsmithing it
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
now so no I think what we were just kind
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
of exploring uh you know what what is
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
meant in terms of a qualified firm
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
and those were the bullet points that
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza had brought up
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you madam
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
chair I agree with representative Betsy
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I also weighing in again that the
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement could handle some
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
concern that we have about if there are
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
so on is it representative Bixby can we
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
move on to the next section uh we'll
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative germana had his hand up
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
so let me just okay entertain what he
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
has to say
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
entertain me it's the right word I
 
01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
suppose thank you madam chair uh you're
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
always entertaining yeah
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to concur with with Madam
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
chair as well as I think and I also want
 
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
to say I very much appreciate uh
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza in the work that
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
you did in in this and thinking through
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
it so thank you very much I just wanted
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
to as you say concur with with the chair
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
and say that I don't think we want to be
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
too prescriptive I think that we want to
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
be aware of what belongs in statute uh
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
and and I think that that the language
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby uh has
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
proposed or something akin to it
 
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
proposed or something akin to it
provides

01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
um enough room for Des to work within
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
without getting prescriptive in ways
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to see put into
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
statute so I hope that was entertaining
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
well worth hearing thank you
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
chair I haven't been through many many
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
RFP processes
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I I would trust the DS people who are
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
managing this process to go through the
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
criteria of who they're
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
of of the people that they're looking at
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
and also their their form their
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
knowledge at forehand of many of these
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
people so that they I think they'll
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
they'll go into the process with a
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good knowledge of their abilities
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
and their conflicts
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.610 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
we so we will look forward to hearing
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
from our committee researcher
 
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she's looking up something now
 
01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:12.290 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she's looking up something now
too

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
well look at uh section six uh which
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
goes from page four line 19.
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
to page five line seven
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.850 align:start position:0%
so this
um

01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
this has to do with targeted completion
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
for rule making
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have plenty of discussion
 
01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative penenza go right ahead
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
so most of this section has to be
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
changed if we because a lot of that a
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
lot of this section then
 
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.169 align:start position:0%
lot of this section then
um

01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
coincides with the next page you know at
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
item three so
 
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.149 align:start position:0%
item three so
um

01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
and I and I think that there has to be
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
wording in here of the 24 months I don't
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
know how that the word smithing of that
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
would look like that um giving their
 
01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
leeway that if if the study's not
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
completed in time or the rulemaking's
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
not done in time that
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
um you know any of course permits are
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
are are held
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
um until those rules
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
um are in place uh so there's definitely
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
some some real work that has to be um
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
done here and I also
 
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
um 150 days I've had numerous
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
conversations with
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
um entities throughout the state that
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
are educated in this
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
um there is no way a a full Statewide
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
study that's going to be done that's
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to impact us from years to come
 
01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:54.620 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be going off of
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't be completed in 150 days it's
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
just not possible and I think it should
 
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
be changed to 250 or 300 days I also
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
think the cost should be increased so I
 
01:32:11.169 --> 01:32:11.179 align:start position:0%
can let other people
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
even at 250 days which is eight months
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
is still
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
um is still quite early for what we're
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking at if they're going to be all
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
over the state because basically you're
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
looking at every place in New Hampshire
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
that you could cite a landfill that's
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
what they're going to have to be looking
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
at all site specific so I mean from one
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
location to the next that is so much
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
work that's done on the geologic and the
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions and
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
um and for this to not be rushed we
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't there doesn't need to be a rush as
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
the representatives said earlier here
 
01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
next to me
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I'd like to have a
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about that
 
01:33:00.729 --> 01:33:00.739 align:start position:0%
okay uh I I'm not sure that
 
01:33:00.739 --> 01:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
okay uh I I'm not sure that
your

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the kind of study that
 
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:07.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
is in sync with well what your idea of a
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
study and what this bill's idea of a
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
study I think are two different things
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think this bill is
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
any potential landfill site in the state
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
has got to be studied
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that's going to
 
01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.030 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that's going to
happen

01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:34.219 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and the way I read this bill
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that what we're directing them to do
 
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.139 align:start position:0%
is to define the standards
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
that would be used by a contractor that
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
would go and evaluate the site
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill does not in my mind
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
evaluate a single site
 
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:57.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:01.139 align:start position:0%
describes how those sites would be
 
01:34:01.139 --> 01:34:02.270 align:start position:0%
describes how those sites would be
evaluated

01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
oh can I follow up please okay I agree
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but to do that you
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually have to study a site you have
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
to study the site to be able to build
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
you can't just go off of that's why I
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying but to develop
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
the rules you actually have to know the
 
01:34:26.290 --> 01:34:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.129 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
and it's so diff all over New Hampshire
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
is from location to location is
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
completely different representative
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I would ask someone to correct me if
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
I am incorrect
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
the Des is going to start looking at all
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
the criteria right now for landfills and
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
what this outside subcontractor is going
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
to do is come up with what they think it
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
should be Des is going to come up with a
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
set of rules and they're going to take
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
into account what the subcontractor says
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
to put into rules they are not going to
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
be telling us the subcontra cannot
 
01:35:14.159 --> 01:35:15.770 align:start position:0%
be telling us the subcontra cannot
dictate

01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
to Des what has to be done they can only
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
propose there'll be public hearings but
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the rulemaking is
 
01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
with des and
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're going to have an
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
outside subcontractor who's going to
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
have other subcontractors as you stated
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
looking at this and Des has now two
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
years to start the process
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
right to to do this I don't think
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
I think we're overlooking this this is
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
not looking at every landfill Des has
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
all that data about the landfills in in
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
their purview
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
they know what's going on at these
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
facilities due to inspections and other
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.229 align:start position:0%
things so
um

01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we need to broaden
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
the scope so much and I think we need to
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
leave it as is representative Bixby
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
so I think it might make sense just to
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
refer back to on the previous page where
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
um where it says what is going to be
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
um proposed uh which is uh in section
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of that uh is it it's in it's in
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
section five
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
um starting at uh where's the wine here
 
01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.870 align:start position:0%
um starting at uh where's the wine here
on

01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
section five let me just it's the next
 
01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.070 align:start position:0%
section five let me just it's the next
page

01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.129 align:start position:0%
page
um

01:36:45.129 --> 01:36:45.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh Phi is uh section five
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
um section five one a
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's page four starting at
 
01:36:58.450 --> 01:36:58.460 align:start position:0%
the top
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
and asset so
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
um the scope of proposal shall include
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
the following an assessment of the
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%

01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
are applicable to to the permitting of

01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
for each such recommendation the

consultant shall identify each state
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
that has adopted the recommended factor
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
and describe how such state has applied
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
the recommended Factor including a

01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
direct recommendations uh
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations on a methodology for
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
consideration of the mass measures set
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
forth in this section of section four of
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
this act and any other additional
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
consideration recommended measures to
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
provide greater or more redundant
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
protection of circles perennial water
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
body in a informing a site specific
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
setback that differs from what the
 
01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
department would otherwise require under
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
its rules so that is basically
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh looking at uh the principles that are
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
used in other states now and seeing how
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
those principles could be can be applied
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
to improve our uh our rules in order to
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
make it more site specific so it's
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
really about determining the principles
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
rather than in doing an investigation on
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I was actually
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
curious that uh with regard to so this
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
does not get lost our desire to see
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
there being the house environment and
 
01:39:08.209 --> 01:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee being given a copy
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
of said report would that be appropriate
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
for that to be here in uh
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
section on page four lines 15 through 18
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
or would that be appropriate to be
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about this the middle
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the final report well it says the
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
department shall make the report
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
available on its website so I mean we as
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
a committee can certainly
 
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
have that and review it
 
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.810 align:start position:0%
have that and review it
um

01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll have it available to us
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
sure I guess I was just uh to may I yeah
 
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
I so I think we were at one point we had
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
discussed about the desire to have it
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
like just physically sent to the house
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee and I maybe I'm
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah I I think that if
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
it is published on the department's
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
website uh and uh we received notice
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
that has been published there that's
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
sufficient we don't need to have a bunch
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
of papers sent over to us so uh or even
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
or even more specific electron sent to
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
us I think we can we can look at the
 
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
website and that that I I appreciate
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be on the website
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
because it means that the process is
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
really public
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
yeah may I follow up briefly
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murray so okay
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
look just
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
it just says that it shall be published
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
they're good institutions I think that's
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
sufficient I don't think it needs to be
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
in the law representative germana
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair on the issue of
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
reporting one of the questions that that
 
01:41:07.689 --> 01:41:07.699 align:start position:0%
I've had is
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I think like a lot of people on the
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not happy with the
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
provision for a reversion to the old
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
rules but I also understand that if we
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
alter that substantially the likelihood
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
is is going to kill the bill
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
um Des is as assured us that they can
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
and will report within that 24 month
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
time period but then we have a provision
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the bill that tells us what happens
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh in in if they don't and where this
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
leads me is to to believe that
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
we need to stay on top of this process
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
even before we get to the end point
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now where they will
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
finally you know uh deliver a report I
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
realize we might not want to put into
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
statute that they would come back to us
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
at a regular basis or at a one year
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
Point say halfway through to report uh
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering what
 
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.450 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering what
uh

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:03.709 align:start position:0%
uh
what

01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
we can do as a committee to make sure
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we are getting some uh timely
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
reports you know for example I would
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
like to halfway through this process
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
have someone from Des come and talk to
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
us and and tell us where they're at uh
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
to give us a progress report to assure
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
us that they're on track that they can
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
deliver this within 24 months whether
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
that needs to be inserted I don't know I
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make it clear that I
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
think that that level of communication
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the possibility
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
that we could revert to the old rules
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
after 24 months 24 months I think this
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee needs to have some reporting
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
maybe halfway through to let us know
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
that Des is in fact on track to deliver
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
that report within that time frame thank
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
you representative germano now
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
um in in this section here it says the
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
selected what page page four line 15 the
 
01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
selected contractor shall complete the
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
assessment and submit a final report to
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
the department within 150 days after
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
contract approval
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
so they have a specific time limit to
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
get this report done and when the report
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
is done the department is going to make
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
it available on its website
 
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.129 align:start position:0%
it available on its website
um

01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's you know a simple request
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
to have Des Supply us with the report I
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to codify it
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
and that being said
 
01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:32.930 align:start position:0%
and that being said
um

01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
I would personally as chairman of this
 
01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
I would personally as chairman of this
committee

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh be kept you know I will keep on top
 
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:44.300 align:start position:0%
of this process and make sure that the
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
director comes to our committee to tell
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
us what the status is of this process
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so I was
 
01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:57.250 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so I was
um

01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:57.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
essentially following up on on what the
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
chairman said
 
01:44:01.739 --> 01:44:02.570 align:start position:0%
chairman said
um

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
or the um we have the capacity to not as
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
a not as not you know without laying it
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
out in a statute we have the capacity to
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
request uh any of the uh Department of
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
personnel who we work with as a
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
committee to come and give us uh reports
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know providing them with
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
enough notice so they can organize their
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts but uh that that is within the
 
01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179 align:start position:0%
purview of the committee to request
 
01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.179 align:start position:0%
updates from a department on ongoing
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
business so we don't need to put that
 
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
into statute another you know if we
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh set up a subcommittee that
 
01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
would be you know
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with oversight that is
 
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
something we we have a we have the
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
capacity to do as a committee if so if
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
if say
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
um a half a dozen of us or or you know
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
plus or minus a bit wanted to be a
 
01:45:06.129 --> 01:45:06.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to uh take into to
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
essentially continue to track this that
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
is something we can set up we have the
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
capacity to set up as a committee
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
without anybody's permission or without
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
writing any new laws
 
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
I would be amenable to that um I think
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
if we had a rule making
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
oversight committee a subcommittee that
 
01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
might be a good answer to this and we
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to put it in statute
 
01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:32.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to put it in statute
yeah

01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.189 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:37.930 --> 01:45:37.940 align:start position:0%
um so I I'd like to say I think that Des
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
barring uh extraordinary circumstances
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
is entirely capable of doing this work
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
within two years uh what I'm concerned
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
about is extraordinary circumstances and
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh we had another department that I
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
worked with that we work with uh not too
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
long ago had one of their uh key staff
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
members leave on very short notice to
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
take care of her her ailing parents uh
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
that put things behind in the Department
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture for uh for several months
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so we know that things like this can
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
happen and we know that this is this is
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing that is out of the
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
Department's con Direct Control uh so I
 
01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:24.179 align:start position:0%
would like to have I think that it would
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
make sense to have some sort of
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
um extension process available
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
for uh in case there are some more
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances and uh it it
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
would it should be
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
um that it was Senator Waters suggested
 
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.290 align:start position:0%
um that it was Senator Waters suggested
that

01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the appropriate person to uh provide
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
that extension would be the commissioner
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
of Des and that would be that the
 
01:46:51.169 --> 01:46:51.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner could provide an extension
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
to uh the solid waste division uh if
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
there are if there are extraordinary
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are causing delays
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that I could see
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
as potentially causing a delay are the
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
loss of Key Personnel for health other
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
reasons uh failure to get a qualified
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
consultant on the first round of first
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
RFP round or disruption of customary
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
operation of the department or the
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
government from something like a
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic I think that there should be
 
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
something in place that would allow for
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
an extension and the length of that
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
extension is something that would be I
 
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
would need to discuss a little bit more
 
01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.669 align:start position:0%
would need to discuss a little bit more
representative

01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:34.679 --> 01:47:36.290 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
Murray I'm sorry my my brain just went
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
blank I didn't know it was me no anyone
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
over there
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
um so in it so my question is uh I guess
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
to representative Bixby it's May I sure
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
um do you see this as a one-time
 
01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.310 align:start position:0%
um do you see this as a one-time
extension

01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
is that what you're envisioning
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I could see the the commissioner
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
being able to provide you know one
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
extension or two extensions I I don't
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
think that the total length of extension
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
should be any more than a year uh and uh
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think the senator said he'd be
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable with two months I'm would
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that too much that I
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
think the two months might be a little
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
bit short I think we need to find out
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
from various stakeholders who might have
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
objections to this uh about you know
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
what range they would be willing to
 
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.510 align:start position:0%
what range they would be willing to
accept

01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative akantois thank you madam
 
01:48:38.209 --> 01:48:38.219 align:start position:0%
chair what about if we put in like three
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
extensions of 120 days each
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
that way you have three extensions but
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
you're also pushing them under the gun
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um and yeah you're limiting the
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
length of each extension so that they
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
have to come back with a good reason for
 
01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:55.930 align:start position:0%
have to come back with a good reason for
that

01:48:55.930 --> 01:48:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh one quick question uh thank you madam
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
chair so these these extensions would
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
push back the reversion time correct yes
 
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.189 align:start position:0%
push back the reversion time correct yes
yes

01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted to
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
say that I think that this is a good
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
compromycin coming up with exactly how
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
many extensions and for what amount of
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
time I think
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
um you know three at 120 days is a good
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
idea but you know we can do a little
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
more research on that but I do think
 
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
that this is something that if we want
 
01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:30.020 align:start position:0%
to see this bill pass we need to
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
compromise a little bit and it may not
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
be perfect but
 
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
I mean for me I
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think they'll ever need the
 
01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
reversion clause
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
I mean they're gonna they want to get
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
the work done and and I think they will
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
get the work done in time
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
but um I also am sensitive and
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the points that
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has brought up that
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know stuff happens and we do have
 
01:50:05.169 --> 01:50:05.179 align:start position:0%
delays for unforeseen circumstances
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
we want to build in something here that
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
would prevent that reversion if those
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
delays occurred representative coulon
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm just curious
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a way we could put a
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
provision in to let DS use
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
um artificial intelligence so they won't
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
be interrupted by a pandemic or any
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting concept and I
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they would they use chat
 
01:50:40.199 --> 01:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they would they use chat
gbt

01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's such a new technology I don't know
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
that they'd want to rely on that
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um thank you madam
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair one of the things that I was
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
um I personally
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
am of the mindset the department did say
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
that they felt like 24 months was
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
something that they could achieve I
 
01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
agree given representative bixby's
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances I would like to
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
see there being perhaps maybe something
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
three extensions possible around the
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
90-day term I mean I really don't when
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're pushing something out to 120 days
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
then we're getting into past a quarter
 
01:51:22.739 --> 01:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
then we're getting into past a quarter
yeah

01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
um so I would uh I guess caution going
 
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
that much further in each extension
 
01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:34.629 align:start position:0%
that much further in each extension
yep

01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I will
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
try to be
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
well I have to think about my wording
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
very carefully I will not be able to
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:51:53.169 --> 01:51:53.179 align:start position:0%
unless there is a foolproof amendment
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
that forces extensions if they are
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and takes it out of the hands
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:12.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
so my question to you would be
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative datsey if the
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner didn't make that decision
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
who would
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
it would be automatic in other words if
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
they couldn't meet the 24-month deadline
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
that they would be forced then to have
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
whatever a 90-day extension 120 day
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
extension but that
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
extension would be mandatory so that the
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
reversion didn't take effect that's what
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
would you require the commissioner to
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
give a reason why
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
they would need the extension
 
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
why the work wasn't done in time
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
no I mean I I think that probably would
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
be evident
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
um you know because of delays or
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
something so I don't think we have to be
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
that granular what my concern is this is
 
01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:18.260 align:start position:0%
my third term I have definitely seen
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes or have perceived changes that
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm uncomfortable with in the department
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
of environmental services so I think if
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want something to inadvertently
 
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:36.350 align:start position:0%
we don't want something to inadvertently
revert

01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
back to a former permitting process that
 
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
we have to be very deliberate in making
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
sure that there's no wiggle room
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
and that the report isn't produced in 24
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
months and there's leeway in our wording
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
so that reversion can take place that's
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
what my concern is representative
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
germana uh thank you madam chair and
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
along the lines of of what
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy is has suggested I
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
could imagine a clause who would say
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of the in the
 
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
event that Des is unable to complete the
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
report within 24 months the director
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
shall request an extension up to let's
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
say 120 days and provide rationale for
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
that and so that directs the director to
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
apply for that so in that sense it's
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
automatic and with that extension there
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
is a rationale provided by the director
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
so to me that seems like it might be
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish a couple of purposes
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so and I also want to be clear the
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
report is not the one that's done in 24
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
months the report is done in after 150
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
days and it's after the 150 days that
 
01:54:57.129 --> 01:54:57.139 align:start position:0%
rules then can be
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
developed and go to gel car and
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
everybody else that needs to give its
 
01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.430 align:start position:0%
everybody else that needs to give its
blessing

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
blessing
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so and that's where we're going to
 
01:55:07.810 --> 01:55:07.820 align:start position:0%
get into
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
where we might need an extension of time
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
because you know I don't know when
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to get this done
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative kantois thank you just
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
for clarification because I thought we
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
were talking about an extension for the
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
subcontractor if they didn't complete
 
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.109 align:start position:0%
subcontractor if they didn't complete
their

01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
report on time not the department I am
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
expecting that the department is going
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be working on rules and will have
 
01:55:37.609 --> 01:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
their rules completed in two years I
 
01:55:37.619 --> 01:55:38.629 align:start position:0%
their rules completed in two years I
mean

01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
they have two years to complete it
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
they're going to be waiting they're
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to start their rules now and then
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to take a look at what the
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
subconscious the contractor does and
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
then take that and integrate and see
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
where they compare where they're the
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
same where they're different and have
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
discussions about that but I thought the
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
extension was for the subcontractor and
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
well the the way this is written the
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
subcontract the the contractor or
 
01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:10.940 align:start position:0%
subcontractor has to have their report
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
shall have their report done in 150 days
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby right so uh I I
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
expect that the subtract that the
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
subtract some car the contractor will be
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
held to that 150 day uh day limit that
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that that is in the bill and I and
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
Des will you know work with them to make
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
sure that happens I I am and I also am
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know I have
 
01:56:43.129 --> 01:56:43.139 align:start position:0%
full confidence that Des can with all
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
things being equal
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
produce this produce the rules on the
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
time scale that is of two years uh but
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
if you know God forbid something happens
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
to the P to a person or persons who are
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
key to the process and Des and they need
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
to hire new people to take that on that
 
01:57:12.850 --> 01:57:12.860 align:start position:0%
it will take time for that to you know
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
for that adjustment to be made and
 
01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of thing where there
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
might need to be an extension yeah
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
exactly okay exactly thank you
 
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one of
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
one of We Were
 
01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
all on the same playing field for is the
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
extension would also
 
01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:39.980 align:start position:0%
include any advance is that correct
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.739 --> 01:57:51.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:53.810 --> 01:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
in a sense who's really going to be
 
01:57:55.729 --> 01:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
police so let's say they hire the
 
01:57:59.089 --> 01:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
contractor and it's not done in 150 days
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
there's not really anyone that's going
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
to be policing that
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so if it takes longer than 150 or if
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's if there's more money that they
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
need I assume that they're going to come
 
01:58:16.209 --> 01:58:16.219 align:start position:0%
back and and and ask for that correct
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know I know but
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
I don't represent Bixby yeah so um so
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
the so
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
the money is one issue that um uh Des
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
feels that they can get someone for 150
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
000 and one of the uh you know if that
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that
 
01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.070 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that
um

01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
on the first round of the RFP that 150
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
000 is not sufficient to uh uh to get a
 
01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:56.219 align:start position:0%
qualified contractor then uh they would
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
be uh then Des would has it in their
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
capacity to go to the fiscal committee
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
and request enough money to uh get to to
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
get a qualified contractor so that is
 
01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
something that we do not necessarily
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to write into statutes no I know I
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
know uh it is you know it is something
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
that we could put in uh if it would make
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
people more comfortable but it's not
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
something that that uh they need they
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the authorization in the
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza okay so
 
01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:34.250 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza okay so
um

01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
first question kind of answered so yes
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
the 24 months
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and then having extensions I get it
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we're gonna have
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of that have extensions in there and
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
still have the paragraph that states it
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
can revert back
 
01:59:55.689 --> 01:59:55.699 align:start position:0%
is that what we're saying
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes so um so we
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
still have the the reversion paragraph
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
will still be in there and if there is
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
an extension then the reversion won't
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
happen until after any extensions have
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
been have expired and
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
I have been told by
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
um no Senators by
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
um by other folks who are aware of the
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
lay of the land that if we remove the
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
reversion Clause completely then we have
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
no bill and I am not willing to be in a
 
02:00:33.609 --> 02:00:33.619 align:start position:0%
position of having no bill because
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
having a bill that we don't really
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
entirely like is a whole lot better than
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
having no bill
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative germano
 
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I wanted to
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
say I appreciate your earlier
 
02:00:47.099 --> 02:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
say I appreciate your earlier
clarification

02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we could know what we were all
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the difference between the
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
report which is 150 days as opposed to
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
the rules which is 24 months so I
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate your clarification I think
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
there were two
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
ways of thinking about the possibility
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
of an extension to the 24 month period
 
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.109 align:start position:0%
of an extension to the 24 month period
one

02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
proposed by representative dutsy which
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
is not specific to say to a pandemic
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's an auto and it would be automatic
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
if Des is unable to complete their work
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
within 24 months whereas uh the
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
possibility that representative Bixby is
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
offered would be under extraordinary
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh I again I want to say I
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
come down in in that case with
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative representative dutse and
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
that if Des is unable to complete the
 
02:01:37.729 --> 02:01:37.739 align:start position:0%
work within 24 months if we say the
 
02:01:40.089 --> 02:01:40.099 align:start position:0%
director shall request
 
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
an extension up to let's say 90 days
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
right in that case it gives the director
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
discretion to determine it could be 30
 
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
days he could say look we're almost
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
there we just need a month or he could
 
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
say we need 60 days right so it's not
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
saying that it has to be 60 or 90 days
 
02:01:59.209 --> 02:01:59.219 align:start position:0%
it would say for example up to 90 days
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
and provide a rationale and that I think
 
02:02:01.739 --> 02:02:03.050 align:start position:0%
and provide a rationale and that I think
would

02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
provide for the kinds of circumstances
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby is referring
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
to right if there are those kinds of
 
02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:11.470 align:start position:0%
to right if there are those kinds of
extraordinary

02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances but again that
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
would be in the rationale of the
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
director and again that request is
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
flexible because it would be up to and I
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
think that would also meet some of the
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
concerns of the stakeholders because if
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
the director were to come to the
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee and say we need another 45
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
days in order just to complete this
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
report report that provides the
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
assurance that certain stakeholders are
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
looking for that was the argument that
 
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
was made to us obviously businesses who
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
are looking to to get permits need to
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
have some certainty in in the market and
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
in in the process and so again if the
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
director were to come and say we need X
 
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
number of days in order to complete this
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
study I think that that makes sure that
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're not simply reverting to the to the
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
old rules and it provides the stability
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
and the assurance that stakeholders are
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
so there's two things
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
um that are that are in this and I don't
 
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
know if it really can be changed so
 
02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
on page four under line 17 18. it says
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
the department shall make the report
 
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
available on its website and shall
 
02:03:28.129 --> 02:03:28.139 align:start position:0%
review and consider the report's
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
recommendations when drafting rules as
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed rules are
 
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
already being worked on now so in all
 
02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:38.689 align:start position:0%
already being worked on now so in all
actuality

02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
actuality
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
this all this work
 
02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
the department could actually not use
 
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
any of the information based upon this
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
line there is nowhere inside this entire
 
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
bill that says that they have to use the
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
information that is provided from from
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
this report
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
I understand what everybody's talking
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
about right you know we were told in a
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
committee about this paragraph
 
02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
when you say in anything in any bill you
 
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
say okay you got to have it done by 24
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
months extensions whatever it doesn't
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
matter hey you have to have it done by
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
24 months unless you don't have it done
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
by 24 months it negates this entire bill
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
it can't be in there I'm sorry there
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
can't be a revert back at all because it
 
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:31.669 align:start position:0%
can't be a revert back at all because it
could

02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
we always have to trust and verify and
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
so having it in there still has an out
 
02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
meaning I don't care if there's three
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
extensions it still has an out and that
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a problem
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay if if
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think we have a couple of goals here
 
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
you one of the goal
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
that we want to get rid of the 200 foot
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
setback and the other goal is we want to
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
make the process more scientific so what
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
if we said that
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
I mean basically uh there would be no
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
timeline on the extensions but that
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
there would be no reversion back until
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
the report was finished
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay or something to that effect so so
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
basically what you do is that we could
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
keep the wording in revert back
 
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
but if there was no but if if it
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't revert back
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
until the report was finished then no
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
matter what the time frame was there
 
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
would never be a reversion back so you
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
keep the wording
 
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.370 align:start position:0%
keep the wording
that

02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
the other body
 
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:53.209 align:start position:0%
the other body
wants

02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
wants
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
but in reality it can't revert back
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
until the report is completed whatever
 
02:06:01.450 --> 02:06:01.460 align:start position:0%
that time frame is representative
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
represents right exactly the rules not
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the report thank you representative
 
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.250 align:start position:0%
the report thank you representative
Bixby

02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would guarantee you
 
02:06:09.659 --> 02:06:12.530 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would guarantee you
veto

02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
and uh and my and I don't want to I
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
don't want a bill that's going to be
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to be vetoed because I think
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
that there is no chance of overriding
 
02:06:23.639 --> 02:06:26.270 align:start position:0%
that there is no chance of overriding
one

02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
what a good time
 
02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:35.450 align:start position:0%
what a good time
um

02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
so if if I was King for a Day I just cut
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
that whole reversion thing out
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay unfortunately I was on the colonel
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
and not a king
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I understand the environment where
 
02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh you know we've been told that that uh
 
02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.850 align:start position:0%
that that would
um

02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know Force the Senate into into
 
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the bill got it so the
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
alternative then is say okay well we're
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to extend the thing out as long as
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
we can to keep the reversion away and
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's where the extensions come in
 
02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.729 align:start position:0%
that's where the extensions come in
and

02:07:12.729 --> 02:07:12.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
essentially that gives you
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
if you did if you did three for 120 days
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
for example that gives you another year
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
so that pushes the reversion out for
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and that I mean that
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
so that means you basically got three
 
02:07:32.219 --> 02:07:34.910 align:start position:0%
so that means you basically got three
years

02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.169 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
but to me an automatic research
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
extension doesn't make any sense that
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
that just
 
02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
you may as well just put 36 months and
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
call it a day
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
um if it's automatic you got to have
 
02:07:51.649 --> 02:07:51.659 align:start position:0%
some way to hold the department to to
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
task to get the thing done in two months
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
in two years
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
um so I I I I I don't like this
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the way it's it's structured but I
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
like it better than getting the bill
 
02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
vetoed and trying to overcome a veto so
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where I'm at and I I
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
would I would sign up to it in this
 
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
general form because of that over sorry
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I thank you madam chair I I want to
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
start by saying that I agree with
 
02:08:24.649 --> 02:08:24.659 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton that uh and
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
Bixby that if we are um if we allow
 
02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
extensions I think that we can probably
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
avoid reversion
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
um but the other ques that my question
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
is don't the old rules expire during
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
this process they expire next year
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
so they have to get new rules in place
 
02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.450 align:start position:0%
so they have to get new rules in place
anyway

02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:46.460 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't a plan to invoke the
 
02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:55.970 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't a plan to invoke the
reversion

02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
reversion
 
02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
why are people fighting so hard to keep
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
it in the bill
 
02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:07.609 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
so

02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:07.619 --> 02:09:08.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know if everything was noticed
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
this but there's a profound lack of
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
trust in this region and uh so uh those
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
who uh the so there are some people who
 
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
the people who want the reversion in
 
02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
the people who want the reversion in
there

02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
are afraid that there will be an
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
intentional uh attempt to with
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
litigation to slow the process down
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
forever and uh and if the if there is no
 
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
reversion if it's completely open-ended
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
then the process then the new rules
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
could take forever and ever because
 
02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
litigation was slowing them down
 
02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:53.780 align:start position:0%
on the other hand uh those who
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't like the re the reversion
 
02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
Clause think that uh the process could
 
02:10:02.810 --> 02:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
be slowed down with litigation in order
 
02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:05.099 align:start position:0%
to trigger the reversion clause
 
02:10:05.099 --> 02:10:06.890 align:start position:0%
to trigger the reversion clause
and

02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
there is no good answer to that complete
 
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
lack of trust and we had to sort of
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
shoot somewhere in the middle and my
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
feeling is that the closest we can get
 
02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:20.099 align:start position:0%
is a shot through the middle and still
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
get the bill passed is to have to put in
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
the extension and hope and I and I hope
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the Senate and the governor will be
 
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
willing to accept the bill with the
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
just to follow up with what
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby was saying
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't able to be here last time
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
for this hearing so I went out and spoke
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
to the director
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
um specifically to ask him about the
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
rules in if it was reasonable that they
 
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
would be completed in two years and his
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
answer was yes and having worked with
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
the director for the last six years
 
02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:13.370 align:start position:0%
the director for the last six years
um

02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
I believe him to be a man of his word
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
and he's always been upfront and honest
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with this committee and So based
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
on what he told me
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is how I am looking at this bill
 
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
that is how I am looking at this bill
so

02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
chair and I want to follow-up question I
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
think it was representative Howard I
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
think I but in any event the question
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
was about when the current rules expire
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the chair you answered that they
 
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
expire next year and I think that's a
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
further reason why it's important to get
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
something passed right is because uh the
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
the uh moratorium or the abeyance right
 
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
during the rules writing process I think
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
is critically important particularly
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
since the current rules are going to
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
expire and we want during that time to
 
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
have a an abeyance right so that
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
the department can continue to work on
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the rules so in any event I
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that in as a reason
 
02:12:22.609 --> 02:12:22.619 align:start position:0%
why I also agree that it is especially
 
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
important that we get something passed
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is this proverbial sausage making
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
process but particularly because the
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
rules expire next year I think we really
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
do have to
 
02:12:36.649 --> 02:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
do something that has the best chance of
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
of getting through and providing that
 
02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
of getting through and providing that
abeyance

02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
abeyance
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
represent them now
 
02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:44.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I was just going
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
to make a comment about representative
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
potenza's earlier two-part question
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
um that this bill doesn't require the
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
report to be enacted I feel equally
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
concerned that the report that comes out
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
could say hey everything's great as it
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
is we're leaving in 200 footstep back so
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think there should be a
 
02:13:01.729 --> 02:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
requirement that it's enacted because I
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
think there's a little concern about
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
what might come out of this report and
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
it might just leave things as they are
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
which is not I think what anyone on this
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
committee wants
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I have a couple
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
of concerns I think reversion is
 
02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
of concerns I think reversion is
untenable

02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
untenable
 
02:13:26.290 --> 02:13:26.300 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the political
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
implications of how we get the most
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
protective bill because some of these
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
judgments are going to be value
 
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
judgments not scientific judgments alone
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
and because of that I want the maximum
 
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
amount of protection
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
protective language in the bill
 
02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:53.099 align:start position:0%
however we decide that is
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
and I also think on principle it's not
 
02:13:58.810 --> 02:13:58.820 align:start position:0%
pro forma that the legislation
 
02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
legislative body writing the law gets
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
the report
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
I understand it's going to be on the
 
02:14:08.689 --> 02:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
website I think it's a it's a statement
 
02:14:11.569 --> 02:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
that says to the people writing it
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
this report is going to be received by
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
the people who wrote the Bill
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to follow up on
 
02:14:37.870 --> 02:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative germanna's Point uh about
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the rules expiring uh on with
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
next summer and they will the rules will
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
have to be written uh but if they are
 
02:14:53.569 --> 02:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
have to be written by next summer rather
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
than by the timeline in this bill uh
 
02:15:03.729 --> 02:15:03.739 align:start position:0%
and without the input from that from the
 
02:15:05.689 --> 02:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
consultant's study
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
I think we can be pretty sure that the
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
rules are not going to be as good as if
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
and if we don't pass this bill then
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be you know we'll be stuck with
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know until the new rules are
 
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
published things can go forward under
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
the old rules and we will probably get
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
less good rules without this bill so uh
 
02:15:31.729 --> 02:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um even though this bill is
 
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
I I there's the the phrase about the
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
perfect being the enemy of the good
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
which I think it might be overstating
 
02:15:46.569 --> 02:15:46.579 align:start position:0%
the the the really good is uh we the the
 
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
almost acceptable is still uh we we
 
02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
don't we I mean I don't think any of us
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
are going to like the bill that we pass
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
we would even less like the bill that we
 
02:16:07.569 --> 02:16:07.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you very
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair and and to speak to uh
 
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's point which was
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
speaking to my point uh uh I would also
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
remind and also something that the chair
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
remind us of that with that 150-day uh
 
02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:25.619 align:start position:0%
time period right for the report to come
 
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
back right so you're like in about five
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
months or so and then that report is
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to go on the website and and the
 
02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
chair can ask the director to come talk
 
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
to us when that report has been
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
delivered and then we can ask questions
 
02:16:39.889 --> 02:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
and and I think that speaks to
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's point about how
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
we can use this 24 month time period I'm
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the favor of automatic extensions if
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
needed but how we can best use the time
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
period because I'm also not happy with a
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
lot of aspects of this bill but I think
 
02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we collectively can speak to some
 
02:16:58.810 --> 02:16:58.820 align:start position:0%
of our concerns
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
through working with Des during this
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
process after the report comes back and
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
helped to shape the process in ways that
 
02:17:09.410 --> 02:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully will make us all more
 
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the outcome thank you
 
02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.450 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the outcome thank you
okay

02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so we are coming up to quarter to 12.
 
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.099 align:start position:0%
we could probably talk about this bill
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
all day long
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
but um we do have some time constraints
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to take the last few
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
minutes to kind of wrap things up um I
 
02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:31.429 align:start position:0%
minutes to kind of wrap things up um I
know

02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is working on an
 
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm sure we'll take a lot
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
of the comments and thoughts
 
02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:43.700 align:start position:0%
um and compile them as he's uh
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
writing writing up the amendment that he
 
02:17:50.169 --> 02:17:50.179 align:start position:0%
will be sending to OLS
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
is that true well we
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
ascended and what I want
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to have both the chair
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
and the writing member's name on the on
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
the amendment whoever's name is first I
 
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't care but I want it to be you know
 
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan absolutely
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:18:19.370 --> 02:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to wrap up our
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
work session for this morning
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to have a split out
 
02:18:28.849 --> 02:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
into our caucuses so we could further
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
discuss the upcoming exec session this
 
02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:34.610 align:start position:0%
discuss the upcoming exec session this
afternoon

02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
and we will be breaking for lunch um I
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
guess you could take now till one
 
02:18:49.089 --> 02:18:49.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.099 --> 02:18:52.030 align:start position:0%

applicants uh essentially what that does
 
03:41:18.729 --> 03:41:18.739 align:start position:0%
is it streamlines
 
03:41:22.849 --> 03:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
the process and uh
 
03:41:25.929 --> 03:41:25.939 align:start position:0%

um Des won't be able to do the

interstate background checks so they
 
03:41:48.530 --> 03:41:48.540 align:start position:0%

the impact of uh either multiple

contaminants from multiple uh uh
 
03:48:20.769 --> 03:48:20.779 align:start position:0%
emitters in a particular area or uh
 
03:48:25.250 --> 03:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
multiple different types of of uh uh
 
03:48:29.150 --> 03:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
contaminants that might together cause a

greater degree of of health risk or
 
03:48:35.690 --> 03:48:35.700 align:start position:0%

September 1st 25 2025 and it makes sure
 
03:49:03.889 --> 03:49:03.899 align:start position:0%
that uh the report goes to our committee
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
