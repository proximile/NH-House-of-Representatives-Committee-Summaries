1012 executive session and I recognize
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
representative Reed to make a
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I um motion
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
1012 um I make an OTP motion on House
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
FN would you like to speak to your
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
motion um I would I like this this bill
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
because um Everybody every parent knows
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
their child and um everybody has
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
different opinions of what is safe and
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
not safe for a child to do and I think
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
this bill protects parents um choice in
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
what they allowed their their children
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
to safely do I see this is a a nice
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
protection thank you thank you
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
representa tenar would you like to speak
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
to a second I just like to say concur
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
with representative re and well said
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
Thank You
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Murray thank you Mr
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
chair um I have some concerns with this
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of just creating a blanket
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
exception um that doesn't really seem
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
necessary in my opinion I did try to
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor on an amendment to
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were raised by
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
attorney Enders and new Futures and she
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
was not willing to make the changes we
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussed um and so because of that I
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this bill and I
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
would urge others to do the
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
discussion can you can you clarify there
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
are guidelines guard rails in here to
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
protect the the child um if a parent can
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
present their R rationale for allowing a
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
child to to do a certain activity um I
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
mean there's common sense built into
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
well the specific point that attorney
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
Enders raised was I think it was um I
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the text of the bill in front
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
of me if you give me just one second but
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
um that it said parents uh can't be um
 
00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:19.519 align:start position:0%
you know charged I guess uh if uh no
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
actual harm was done to the child and in
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
attorney Ender's opinion and in mine um
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
you know usually we we want to stop har
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
before it happens and not wait until a
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
PR so I know I may be older than dirt
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
but um this is kind of like how I grew
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
up um I had to be home when the street
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
lights came on nobody was helicoptering
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
over me making sure
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
everything was okay we used to run
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
around in the woods and all kinds of
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
stuff so I I think just just let's
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
parents go back to that because
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
way we' have decided that our children
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything unless we're two feet
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
away from them watching them um they
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
don't get any life
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
experiences um you know you got to
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
scrape your knees a few times and to
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
figure out to do that so if you don't
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
have these life experiences growing up
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
then you won't be ready for real life
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
18 thank you my concern is that a bill
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
that says uh it it's actually creating
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh an exemption that encourages uh uh
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom uh in children um
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
actually seems like it it has the
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
potential to actually put kids into more
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
danger and I think the reason for that
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
is is the bill really doesn't specify
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
what types of endangerment activities
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
would be covered under the law so I I
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
know the sponsor's intent was to create
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
a bill that uh addressed what she thinks
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
is is an overly broad statute but I
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
think the way to address a statute that
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
you think is overly broad isn't by
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
replacing it with another statute that
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's equally
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed um there's been
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment proposed to this bill um by
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor um and it makes a change to
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
the last sentence if if you wouldn't
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
mind represent Murray Could you please
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
call out the difference in in the
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment um thank you Mr chair from
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
comparing the text um the only
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
difference I see is the added lines of
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
13 and 14 which adds a new section that
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
says it is not a violation of the
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
section for parents to allow children to
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
take reasonable risks to further their
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
development as independent human beings
 
00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:10.350 align:start position:0%
development as independent human beings
thank

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.190 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
um no I I'm about to pass it out um
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
could you pass that to the left and
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
right hasn't been introduced yet I'm
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
going to ask um if representative Reed
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
would withdraw her OTP motion and then
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh make an OT uh introduce the amendment
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
um if that would be okay do you withdraw
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
yes I you withdraw your
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
second um the amendment's coming around
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
we know that it's just a one change uh
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
second excuse me one sentence change
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.430 align:start position:0%
that I
believe

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
um that she made after
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
conferring with several people I think
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:06.669 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
now that you have it if you if you could
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
just look at um the addition is
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
end

00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
so I recognize representative Reed to
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
motion I motion to um ought to pass on
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
054h second representative tzar um we're
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
still in basically the same discussion
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
um anyone have anything further to add
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
um based on the the one sentence
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise representative Reed um I still
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe that um life is dangerous
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that any of our
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
activities are not going to end in us
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
getting hurt falling down the stairs cut
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
in a bagel all of those things can be
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous I think that parents um we
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
should give them credit for common sense
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
and knowing their children and I think
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's better for child development for
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
them to be able to be kids than to have
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
um constant fear of getting hurt and
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
being hovered over and I think this bill
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
is long overdue and we should pass it
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Murray thank you Mr
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
chair I feel like people are thinking of
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
like a specific set of circumstances
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the spill I have no problem with
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
kids running around outside and I did
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
that as well when I was a kid and as far
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
as I understand that's not currently
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
outlawed um but the guidelines here are
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
just so broad um and it mentions actual
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
injury or harm that doesn't um account
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
for any potential mental or emotional
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
distress that may happen to a child due
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
to uh parental decisions or parental
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
neglect um
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
I um just to share some of my own
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
experience grew up um going to a church
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
that my parents were um unfortunately
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
manipulated into because of their own
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances um growing up and fears
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
they had about me being out in the world
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
and in that church
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
um many of the kids were not allowed to
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
get to know any other kids their own age
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
we were all
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
homeschooled um we were not allowed to
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
engage with the world in a way that is
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
necessary for kids growing up and I just
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't think this is taking into account
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
like according to this you know this
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
feels like it would leave an exception
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
for parents who want to just like keep
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
their kid in the house all day long all
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
year round and never seeing other human
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
being that would be allowed with this
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill and it's there's just no account
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
for the like mental and emotional
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
well-being of these kids um and I I just
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
feel like again the guidelines are just
 
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.710 align:start position:0%
feel like again the guidelines are just
so

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
broad um I just don't understand why we
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
need to make an exemption when we
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
already have laws that make clear what's
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
a crime and what's not a
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
crime thank you just for the record um I
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
was kept inside my entire childood look
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
how I turned out um representative Lynn
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to invite you to give us a
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
class everyone hearken and listen to the
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
former Supreme Court Justice on a a
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
class of statutory construction could
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
you tell us please when you have a
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
colon after an offense under this
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
section if then we have a b c and d what
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
do the colons or semicolons mean after
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
each sentence ABC and because at
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
sentence c i noticed colon and and so
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the other semicolons to read
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
or I
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
Beal okay so just for clarification no
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
parent or legal guardian of a child who
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
makes a parenting decision shall be
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
guilty of an offense under this section
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
if a there's no actual injury or harm
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
and no actual injury or harm is the
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
result of an unavoidable or unforeseen
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
accident would if that section A is not
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
satisfied does then the rest not matter
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's irrelevant think in order to this
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
to invoke this section I think you have
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
to satisfy all all four so I mean the so
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
forg there was no actual injury of har
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
um you you wouldn't satisfy this section
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
mean the whole class sorry about that if
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
you uh if you didn't satisfy let's say a
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
Your example then you wouldn't satisfy
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
this section that I don't think that
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily means that what you've done
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
is a crime there may you may not you
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
know you may not satisfy the the all of
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the sections of whatever whatever
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
provision um would make it a crime but
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't satisfy this unless you met
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
all four of them so I I guess here's a
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to get an example
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
for example uh so
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
um there's a reasoned approach let's go
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
to C to such a decisionmaking that takes
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
into consideration risk versus benefit
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
if I did decide to keep my child
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
sequestered never let them out would I
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
then not get the protections of this
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
because there's really not a reason to
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
approach to do such a thing or would I
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
still be protected because there was no
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
injury proven to the child because I
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
kept them locked up
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
inside right I mean well I mean if there
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
was you know if I I think harm doesn't
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean physical harm only if
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
there was emotional or you know harm
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing I think that could
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
that could be harm so a child left alone
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
for example who who was traumatized by
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
that they could still be charged with
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
neglect because of the first sentence a
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
right I mean if the other right exactly
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yeah no I think that's right I
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
right yes all right so in my opinion if
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
someone does something so irresponsible
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
with their child that it it results in
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
emotional harm uh physical harm or or um
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
even if it's just potential physical
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
danger but still gives them emotional
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
trauma and that's picked up at either at
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
school or however it's a doctor they can
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
still be charged with neglect because of
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
that word harm um so I think that
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
answers a lot of of the questions we've
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
heard um it doesn't maybe not satisfying
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
to everybody but I just wanted to point
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
it out further discussion um
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative s and then Bal thank you
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
um I oppose the the underlying bill as
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
well as the amendment because to me it
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
it feels hypocritical if we're not
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
allowing parents to make medical
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children based on
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
their children's needs which we've
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
blocked as a house then then it seems to
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
me that this bill is also so unnecessary
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so it it just feels like a
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
hypocritical we want to have our cake an
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
eat it too and I don't think that's
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
Bolton I I really want to push back
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
really hard against the idea that it's
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
possible to prove emotional or
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
psychological harm um I'm not aware of
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
any cases in the family court system
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
where that's been proven therapists are
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh they typically will require um during
 
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.270 align:start position:0%
uh they typically will require um during
the

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the process of uh you know setting up
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
a new patient file that'll require
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
signing a contract that says you won't
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
make the therapist go to court um the uh
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
judges in new Hamp there's a bill I
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
think in child and family right now
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
where they're or I think we I don't
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
remember if it got voted on yesterday
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
but where they're sort of begging judges
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
to allow to give more consideration to
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
the views of the children it's
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult ult to bring
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
in any kind of testimony from a mental
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
health expert on psychological or
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
emotional harm and I don't it seems like
 
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
emotional harm and I don't it seems like
this

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
would set it up so
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
that someone who is causing that because
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
it's so difficult to prove that they're
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
causing that would get off scot-free and
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm and I and I can't stress enough the
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
immense difficulty in proving
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
psychological or emotional harm but I
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if maybe representative Lynn
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
wants to speak I don't know if he's if
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
he was ever in the Family Court thank
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
you I I would suggest that you probably
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
are correct but you are missing the
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
point that we're talking about a
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
criminal statute which would be the
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
neglect statute so the contract is
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
irrelevant um it could be brought in um
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony and the the um all the
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
evidence could be brought in because the
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
criminal statute would Trump that in a
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
civil case I agree if it was a custody
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
case or something like that it's very
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
difficult but a criminal case that
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
evidence would be allowed just uh
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
justice ly representative Lynn would you
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
like to speak to
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
that well I I I I guess I would say that
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think I agree that it is
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove emotional harm or it
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
often can be particularly in the context
 
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
of you know if this if you had a Mal if
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
you had some kind of a malpractice case
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
or or uh a case that was sort of
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
specifically focused on that and there
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
was time to get experts and all that
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
maybe it's maybe it's not as difficult
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
but I think I agree with you in the
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
context of of of a criminal case is
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
probably you know that that that
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
probably is true um you know I guess
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
when when um I believe was this this was
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative was this representative
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
leakas bill or kushman kushman I'm sorry
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
repr I what somebody spoke to me about
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and one of the things that I
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
said the reason that I thought it was
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
that something like this I'm not
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
particularly married to any specific
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
language but something like this was
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
important is it just seemed to
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
me it did make sense to have something
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the law to say that the legislature
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
recognizes or the law recognizes
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we can go too far in trying to
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
protect protect children and really end
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
up harming them because you you you
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
restrict them so so much that they don't
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
have a chance to live and and I think
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's important to have something in
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
the law just to say that the specifics
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
of exactly how it's worded I think this
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
I personally think this is fine but you
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't have to be this I just
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
think having something that says it's
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
okay for parents to let their kids take
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
risks is a is an important thing to to
 
00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:26.990 align:start position:0%
risks is a is an important thing to to
say

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um just I I've did some
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
research myself and eight other states
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
have passed laws like this that they've
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
gained the moniker of free range free
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
range parenting I believe um I see you
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
represent Jamon
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't I see this bill as a
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
totally different in a totally different
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
way um as somebody that grew up with um
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
their parents absent and grew up my
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
she she allowed me to do a lot of things
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
that normal parents I shouldn't say
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
normal parents but a parent may not
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
allow so I'll give you an example on
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon get home from school um
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
throw a a a bag a thing of baloney and a
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
a loaf of bread into a backpack throw it
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
on my BMX bike grab my tackle box and a
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
tent and go I don't come back until
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
Sunday night she has no idea where I am
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
but she knows that I'm out fishing and I
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
take my cousin with me of course
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
um so I see this
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
as that parent that allows that to
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
happen is not going to be
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for for neglect Hey where's
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
your kid I don't know they're out
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
fishing they're they're going to be gone
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
for the weekend and you know what that
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
was before we had cell phones so she
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't track me on GPS couldn't call
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
me on the phone but she knew if I was in
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
trouble that I knew how to get help so I
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
I I see this bill as allowing that type
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
of uh relationship with a parent uh I
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't see it in the light that you folks
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
are here I I don't I I understand where
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but I see it
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
differently um representative new thank
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I completely agree I I
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
love the idea of letting my kids T take
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
risks and and um and you know uh learn
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
their lumps uh get their lumps and learn
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
their lessons um I wanted to ask a
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
question um of Representative Lyn um
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
since we're all drawing on his expertise
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
and U my question my question is um you
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
know when so when it when it says in
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
here that one of one of the uh kind of
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
premises here is is there is a reason to
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
approach to such decision-making that
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration um benefit
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
versus risk and what I get stuck on with
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
that is is reasoned because everyone who
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
goes into a courtroom has a reason right
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's got a reason everybody's got
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
their reasoning what is it doesn't say
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
anything about what the the quality of
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
that reasoning is or kind of what the
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
standard is that that we would hold that
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
reasoning to I would think it would need
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
to be a good argument which in other
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
words is reasoning am I right
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
well I you know I guess I think the way
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
I maybe would respond to that is this I
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
think that what it's designed to get at
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I didn't draft this but what I
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
think it's maybe what it's designed to
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
get at is that to say that the person
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
thought about it um and even if you know
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
even if the person even if the person
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
was well even if you might disagree with
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
their reasoning at least they thought
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
about it um so that you for example if
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
the um the the kid left in the in the
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
hot car um you know if the if the uh if
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
the parents said well look you know I
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
was I literally was going in to buy a
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
package of gum at the 7-Eleven and you
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
know the the store wasn't crowded and so
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't I didn't think about
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
it long but I did think it was only
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
going to take me like you know a minute
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
and a half to do this um I would say
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's a reason you know you
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
thought about it as opposed to something
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
that you just just you know geez I never
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
even thought about you know I I forgot
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
my kid was in the car I didn't realize
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
that my kid was in the back or something
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
like that you know you might say wait a
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
minute that's like you know gez you
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
didn't know that that's you
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
know so that I I'm not sure that's a
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
great example but but I so I I want to
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
emphasize I don't think I have any
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
particular ex you know any expertise as
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
as to sort of reading better expertise
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
than anybody else as to sort of reading
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
language because it's you know you're
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
all smart people you can draw your own
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
say representative Manion thank you Mr
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
chair um so I'm not as old as
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative PR nor have I ever fallen
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
down the stairs while cutting a
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
bagel but I grew up in the 70s and 80s
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
and I used to race BMX bikes bikes um in
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
a sanction in a league it wasn't just a
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
couple of kids in the dirt it was
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
actually sanctioned we traveled around a
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
bit so as a result my son started racing
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
when he he was nine I introduced him to
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
the sport because the the baseball just
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing it for him BMX is an
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
individual sport you win you get the
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
praise you lose it's on you so he became
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
state champion in Mass District champion
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but along the way he's
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
had concussions spraying ankles he broke
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
his wrist um we were in Baltimore in a
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
hospital am I now negligent because he
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
got hurt while entertaining these and he
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
raced nationally so my my fear is is
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
that parents who are
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
having their kids in sanctioned Sports
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
does are they going to be able to be
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
charged with this stuff this this would
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
cover it as far as
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
emotional damage I guess I mean aside
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
from severe stuff he would win and feel
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
good he would lose and feel bad and I
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
would talk to him about losing and what
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
he needs to do to get better at it part
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
of emotional roller coasters and
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
emotional feelings are part of growing
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
up it's part of your character it makes
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
you who you are so there needs to be
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
some degree of that happening to these
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
kids while they're children so when
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're adults they're better able to to
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
cope with this stuff so I I think this
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
bill's good and I'm going to I'm going
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
to uh vote to
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
OTP representative
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't get a chance to
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
discuss this in caucus so let me just
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
say no surprises Ray I did text Linda
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
about this but Mr chairman I support
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation as I think
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn made the point
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
better than I could have there's no
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
statute and law currently after reading
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 639 colon 3 that says that the law
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
respects that children have a right to
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
grow up in interesting scenarios it's
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
not always it's not always easy and it
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't repeal anything that's already
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
in 639 colon 3 that statute is very well
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
written I think and does illustrate what
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
we are talking about here today it's
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
child engagement is wrong and it's
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
illegal under that statute this adds
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
language to that statute which says that
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
parents ultimately have the right and
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
freedom to raise their children if it
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
goes too far then the sections in that
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute prior to that would come into
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
play um so Mr chairman I grew up the
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
same way as many of us have said on you
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
know it was in the early 2000s but uh I
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
I grew up in it was just it was just
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday it's still baby you want to
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw that I grew up part yeah yeah
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
right there you I am alive because you
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
know um yeah I don't know if I've
 
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily grown up yet I think you're
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman but I do support this
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and I will be voting yes on
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
the OTP thank you um and before I take
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
other questions I just want to add
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
something that I think that you um
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
really hit on that's very important we
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
should not read this um bill in
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
isolation this is part of a a broader
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
statute that already covers a lot of
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
scenarios that would make a parent
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
actions illegal in this section clearly
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
says if it's not in violation of any
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
other law so therefore a lot of the
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
concerns we're hearing about are already
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
covered in law in the rest of the
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
statute um so up next representative
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
um I have the same concerns that
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative new um has um and
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually if I understand representative
 
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
Lynn 's explanation
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
so so a through D would all have to be
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
satisfied for um a determination of
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child is
 
00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:36.630 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child is
that

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
correct sorry yes in other words if you
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to satisfy seven I I think the
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
way it's worded with the semicolons and
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
the and I think you'd have to satisfy
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
all of those okay thank you um which
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
actually confirms my my concern um my
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
concern having worked at DCF um with
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
parents of all sorts and children of All
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
Sorts is that this part of the statute
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
would be used to legitimize neglect um I
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
think it limits the discretion of our
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I think right now our judges
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to um take these
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
things into cons consideration and I
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
think my sense is that it will
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
complicate um things the words actual
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
reasoned um I do know how challenging it
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
is to um having been a worked at DCF
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
having been a foster parent an adopted
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
parent um to prove actual injury or
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
injury maybe if it's physical it's
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
easier but harm
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I I don't know I just I
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could support this I I
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
recognize the parents we all let our
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
kids take risks we we use our own
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
discretion but um sometimes the
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
discretion that um brings brings a a
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
parent to the attention of a court um
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
maybe different uh than than um what we
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
would think of within a normal realm of
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
discretion um you I just I'm I'm afraid
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
that um children will be hurt by this
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
and so I I'm not going to support it
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um I just want to
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
make a point um represent Murphy um by
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
by having to satisfy all of those that's
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
actually makes it tougher on the parent
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
in other words if you don't satisfy all
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
of those it doesn't make you exempt it
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
says no parent or legal guardian of a
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
child who makes parenting decisions
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of an offense under this
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
section if so the only way they can be
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
not guilty of an offense is if they
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
satisfy all those it's not the other way
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
around so to in order to Avail
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
themselves of this they would have to
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
say okay no one my child wasn't hurt um
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
the decision wasn't in violation of law
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
and I have this reasoned approach um and
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
the decision-making part and it's
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
keeping with the family Guardians values
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
so that's I just wanted to make that
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
point you may respond oh thank you um I
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
I think I understand that but the my
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
concern is okay if you know we we don't
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
prove or or we just say you prove actual
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
injury or or you miraculously somehow
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
prove harm um a reasoned approach and
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration the benefit
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
versus risk um aligns there with Part D
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the parent of Guardians values what
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
um once once the injury occurs they're
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
done they can't use the rest of these is
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
what my point is so if the child is
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
injured you can't say yeah they're
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
injured but it it was reasoned approach
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
it was you know what I mean they have to
 
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:48.220 align:start position:0%
satisfy all
 
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.789 align:start position:0%
satisfy all
[Music]

00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
those I'm I'm really I'm I am confused
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's not it should if that that were the
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
case then it wouldn't that say or after
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
a um well that's what the semicolon is
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
for I believe and we can go back into
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
class uh they're
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
all if it says or that means it
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
individualizes each of them so if it
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
says or it's only one AB BC or D that
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
exactly it doesn't say that which means
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
it has to be all of them right right so
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
that's but if you're saying that all we
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to do is prove harm or injury then
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
the rest don't matter but that's if the
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
if the colon is
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
there yeah so in other words okay let's
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
put yourself in a DCF position you're
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
back at work you have a kid and you
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
think you you doing an investigation and
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the kid has injury the parent can't use
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
this statute it's already done because
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
they have the injury they can't satisfy
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
all those do you see what I mean or or
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't find any injury but it's a
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
violation of one of the other sections
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
of law they can't use this or if you
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
don't if it's not a violation of any of
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the laws and there is no injury but they
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a reason to approach they
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
said ah I saw something on a TV show I
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
thought it would be cool to do my kids
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
they can't use this um yeah it's it's
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
got to be they have to get all these in
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
order to say you can't prosecute me for
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
being negligent any one of these and
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
they're done um let me see who was up
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pro and just for your
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
information I see all the hands we're
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
writing them down I'm letting people who
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
haven't gone yet go
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
my concern with the law is we're writing
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
a specific exception to say you shall
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
not be guilty we don't do that for a lot
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
of laws we should do it for a specific
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
reason I haven't heard the reason yet
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
I've looked at all the testimony that's
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
gone forward about they let the kids
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
play football they got injured they did
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
all this kind of stuff I just think I
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
don't understand and I I don't like
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
these broad exceptions you shall not be
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
guilty because so and that so I have
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's my problem with this law thank
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
you and I do take a point of PR Personal
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
Privilege I my name was used by
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler and I just want
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
to let the committee know I am seldom
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
surprised by anything he
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
does we know that to be true and that is
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
noted for the record um representative
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
balore back to you who else represent
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
Muse I see you down there I just have a
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
question if anyone on the committee
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
wants to speak to
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
this um gender reassignment surgery is
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
not illegal and the bill that was passed
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
by the house recently with your name
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
attached to it as I understand makes it
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
a criminal act on the part of the
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
physician but not the authorizing
 
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
physician but not the authorizing
parent

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
so given
 
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.150 align:start position:0%
so given
that

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.990 align:start position:0%
that
surgery

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
isn't injury or harm but a medical
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
procedure that is illegal much like a
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
circumcision is a
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
surgery um the parenting decision is not
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
in violation of a law there's a reasoned
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
approach takes into consideration
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
benefit versus risk as I understand it
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
typically it's a last resort when the
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
mental health of the child is at
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
risk and it's in a decision made in
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
keeping with a parent or Guardians
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
Family Values would this explicitly
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
allow for gender reassignment surgery
 
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.510 align:start position:0%
allow for gender reassignment surgery
for

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
minors well as long as it's not in
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
violation of another law I would say
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's a reasonable argument to be made
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
for that yeah and we currently don't
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
have a law against it and if that bill
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
were to pass the Senate and not be
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor it still would
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
not be illegal for the parent to consent
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
to that on behalf of the minor that I
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't know I slept at a holiday in last
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
night but I'm not an attorney um but
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting interesting line of
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
questioning I'm glad you brought it up
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
Muse I I just want to say we should be
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
extremely careful uh in modifying a
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
statute like this um this is the
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
endangering a welfare of a child statute
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and like our domestic violence
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
statute um these statutes were put
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
together with the idea of protecting
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
people who are potential victims and who
 
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.829 align:start position:0%
people who are potential victims and who
are

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um and it it just strikes me
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
as strange that in a statute like this
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
um we would be creating uh an exception
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
for some for for anybody um uh it just
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be like something that
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
we should doing and be doing and I think
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Balden and Murphy have uh
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
have raised some some excellent points
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things that I I think
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
that this statute does can do
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
potentially is to uh legitim legitimize
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh neglect um and I think that it opens
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
the door to some unintended in
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
consequences that um the sponsors and I
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
think some of the folks in this
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh may not necessarily uh be in favor of
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
um I just think it's something that we
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to look at a lot harder before we
 
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.870 align:start position:0%
need to look at a lot harder before we
pass

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
it thank you um let me see I would also
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
remind everyone and I'm not going to say
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
anybody's name or anything but we do
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a another bill that's before us
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that makes exemptions for parents in
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
jail sentences so when we start saying
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
well we don't like making exceptions for
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
anyone for anything um I would remind
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
you of what what else we have before us
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman so I I would
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
like to address some of the very
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
specific things that have been brought
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
up with this
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and when this first when this
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill first came in front of us I I I
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely hate hated it I I thought
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
this was not necessary I personally
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
didn't think there was a very good
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
argument made of any reason why we
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
should pass it and then I started
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking into some of the situations have
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
been brought up today so I know it
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
shocks some people to to know that I
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
guess that I have a life outside of here
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
but I do and one of the things that I
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have to look at are the
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
court papers
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
for child abuse and child neglect
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
cases and pretty much everything that
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
has been said I can assure you
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely is illegal it will not not be
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
illegal if this bill were to pass and if
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
you have a situation
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
where God forbid a parent throws their
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
child into a basement and literally
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
throws down a bag of bread for days at a
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
time that is illegal and this bill will
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
not make that be be legal by any means
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
and you actually are able to prove
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
emotional harm I know that for a fact
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
because at my desk I have about six
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
court documents right now that are all
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
that their emotional abuse their verbal
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
abuse um neglect and at the end of the
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
day even if there's a parent that you
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
really just don't think is a very good
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
parent it's amazing if you start talking
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
about their child they do love their
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
child the very very few exceptions in
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
this world or the person does not love
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
their child so much that they're going
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
to put them an actual Harm's Way and I
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
think that that is what this bill was
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to address was that you know you
 
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
you went into I personally will not go
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
into a convenience store and leave my
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
purse in the car why would I leave my
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
kid in the the car if I won't leave my
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
purse in the car my kids worth more than
 
01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
purse in the car my kids worth more than
my

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
purse but people choose to do that
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
should should it be illegal probably not
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
probably not and I think that that's
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill was trying to address so
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
I I just would like everybody to keep
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
that in mind when you're when you're
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
chairman okay with that I think
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's had a chance to speak who's
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
left oh representative scitec you have
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
not yes I I have no wish to be
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
unpleasant but I'm going to be I guess
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
um first I think unlike representative
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
Newman I think that rep Section 8
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
improves uh the situation but it I still
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't like the bill it strikes me that
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
this I do not know of any particular
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
instance that this is trying to cure it
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
fattens the books for basically what
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be I can't articulate
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
this but it feels like a loyalty oath
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
somehow uh
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
I just everything seems to be illegal
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
that the people have talked about
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
without reference to this this doesn't
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
cure or fix anything I I I don't know
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
it's trying to capture a mood it's
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
trying to turn back what Society seems
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
to be we're going to sue you because you
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
dropped the you tripped over the crack
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
in the sidewalk there just seems to be a
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is react a reaction to a societal
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
Trend and
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
I I I don't like the societal Trend but
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is going to change it
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
either so
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I'll vote for the amendment not the
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill one those
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
rather I wish I had expressed it better
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I wasn't around for the to
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
discuss this
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
earlier thank you
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
um oh sure representative uh Harriet
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
gather thank you Mr chair um I was just
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the notes from um
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
that hearing and um I just want it made
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
known that there was issues with this
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill with the county attorney that was
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
here that day from
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
meramac and um you you had at that time
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
asked him does he see this happening
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
often and he says quite often is he said
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
that um endangering of a minor welfare
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
charges fairly regularly on a
 
01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:28.910 align:start position:0%
charges fairly regularly on a
misdemeanor

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
level and he quoted
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
6393 section 4 to back up what he was
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
saying um I also remember that um um
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
there was another group that was against
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as well um new Futures that's
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
yes so with that said I I can't support
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
the bill as it as it reads now
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
thank you as this is um this is a very
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
important bill um and I I I I would like
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a way it seems like we
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people for it a lot of
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
people against it if there's any way
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
that we could um amend the bill so that
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
we could get we could get broader
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
support because I don't like Partyline
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
bills to do with children
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering and I'm going to
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
ask representative
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
Lynn you know there's this whole broad
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
thing about you know re um if it's in
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
keeping with their values and if it's
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
they have a reason decision many of our
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
criminal laws even civil laws have a
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
have What's called the the reasonable
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
man or reasonable police officer
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable would a reasonable parent
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
addition to this make it still allow for
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
protections of a parent but still set
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
sort of a a societal guideline would
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
that be helpful you
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
think well I know I I think it might you
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
know one one thing that you could
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
consider as I said before I think to me
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
the most important
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
thing is to have because I agree
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
completely with representative scitech
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
although I don't agree with the result
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
he would he would he would reach I I
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
think that the reason that you need the
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
something like this in the law is that
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
we have become I mean there is you know
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
a a mentality at least in some quarters
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
out there that we you know we should be
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
helicopter parents and you shouldn't let
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
your child take any risk and if you if
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
and particularly if a child gets hurt um
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
then we're you know we really want to
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
use 2020 hindsight to say oh you
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have taken that risk or um
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
whatever and I and so I think it
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
something there ought to be something in
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
the law that addresses that and what I'm
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
wondering is suppose you took out SE par
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven altogether and just left
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
in paragraph 8 I mean that you know that
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
does sort of say look it's okay for
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
parents to take reasonable risk and you
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
know if I this if I can just if I I I
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is something I remember for you
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm 74 years old so it's a long
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
time ago no but I'll give you just let
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
give when I was like in seventh grade I
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
think it was seventh grade back in West
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
Haven Connecticut there was this guy
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that was this other co- other student
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
that was that was you know constantly
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
picking on me just constantly picking on
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
me and he had he had so he had he had
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
probably more friends than I did and I
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
was really kind of a wimp and so you
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
know I kept I I was raised by my mother
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
and my great-grandmother and I kind of
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
was you know I was really really afraid
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
frankly and I um sort of you know said
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
to my mother well you know what I'm
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
really having this having this trouble
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
and she was thinking you know I I should
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
I should maybe I should go to the school
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
author and I said no no you can't do
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it'll just make it just worse for
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
me if you do that kind of thing and my
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
great grandmother who we lived with
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
which who was God she had to be in her
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
70s by then she said you know I think
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
you just need to take this guy on I
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
think you just you know maybe you'll get
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
a punch in the nose um but it but but in
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the end that may be the best thing and
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what I did and we had a we had
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
we literally had a physical fight and
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
you know we both we both inflicted a
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
little Dan not nobody got hurt and any
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know significantly but we both we
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
both got bloodied a little bit
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
and after that you that was the end you
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
know I mean we didn't become friends but
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
that was the end of the that was sort of
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the him picking on me and so
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
I guess the question you know in that
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
situation should my great-grandmother be
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
charged with neglect you know if some if
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
a police officer came along and said and
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
found that I had you know a bloody nose
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever um and you talked to me and
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
I said oh well you know my
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
great-grandmother said look this is the
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
this is you know it's this is I think
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
this has be the right thing to do do you
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
might get a punch in the nose but it'll
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
maybe this will end it if if this guy at
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
least knows it you're not going to you
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
know you're willing to stand up to him
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
and it turned out she was right but
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
would a police officer now or a
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutor say you know boy she you know
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
the great grandmother encouraged him to
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
have a fight let's lock her up I I hope
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
not but that's I think that's the thing
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
that there ought to be something in the
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
law that says if the police you know if
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
if that kind of situation comes up um
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
the the police are going to think twice
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
about charging my great-grandmother with
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
with uh with a
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
crime thank you and I just wanted to
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very good point and I
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
like that idea maybe just strike that um
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
that whole thing and just leave the
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
leave the amended piece that that just
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
leaves it for the court to decide but
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
says this is our preference and I wanted
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
to as an example um representative
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
Balden had brought up the U the
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
transgender issue and I just saw in the
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
news um in California um the state had
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
taken children away from their parents
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
because they refused to use
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
pronouns again I mean is that
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
endangerment is that because you I I
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
don't know um but I think we need some
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I agree representative
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
Murray you have your Qui hand raised
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to say that I I like
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's proposal and I
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually was going to suggest the same
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
thing I I think my biggest concern with
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is the kind of loopholes that
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
um the guidelines here can create and um
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is less about um you know I'm
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
against helicopter parenting and I do
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
think kids should be allowed to take
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
some risk um and I was allowed to do the
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
same as a child it's almost the opposite
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of like what loopholes this
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
can create by saying like if a parent or
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
a family you know has certain values or
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
beliefs like they can do all these
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
things like we can't
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
possibly uh Outlaw every potential
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
negative thing that can happen to a
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
child and so I think it's really
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
important to just have um the ability
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
for judges to uh look at the statute and
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to determine whether
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
harm is happening to the child and I
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
think just this paragraph 8 in here
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that um parents have the
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
ability to allow their children to take
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable risks to further their
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
development as independent human beings
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with that line and I
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
do think it's important for
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
kids um to be independent take those
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
risks I also just wanted to make an
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
aside um that feel like there's been a
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
trend in the committee lately to bring
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
up transgender issues for I know I'm not
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
blaming but I'm just saying as the only
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
transperson in this committee it's just
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
not a great feeling to have people try
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
and make points of um by using my
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
community as you know a just something
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
to go back and forth about it just
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make me feel good um and I just
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask that people will be
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
respectful of
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
that we will try and take that into
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
account um representative
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you and I wonder if if
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
maybe uh representative link could help
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
me um on that on the amendment um that's
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
that proposed language is it my question
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
is is it currently a violation of U this
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
section for parents to allow children to
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
take re uh reasonable risks is
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
that I mean if we I would I guess I
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
would say no I would think that
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
that I hope that that's that that's what
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
the law is now but I I guess what I was
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
sort of saying is it probably is a good
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
idea to put that in statute to sort of
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
have you know to be able to have
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
somebody be able to say look it's right
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
in the law that you can do this um even
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
though it even though you know it might
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
be you might read that by implication
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
into the current Law Without this I
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
think there's a value to having it in
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
other words legislative intent right
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
right just follow up and just and just
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
on the in terms of the word um what what
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
is your thought about the term
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable I now um the chair raised a
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
point earlier um should there be a
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable I would I would say no I
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
think that you know that um you know
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's for examp you know in the in the uh
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the self-defense statutes and
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
stuff like that you know you it's pretty
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
General language you can use you can use
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
deadly force or you can use non deadly
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
force if you have a reasonable belief so
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
it you know there's there reasonable is
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable the word reasonable or
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
reasonableness is used quite a bit in in
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
this area thank you so it's in some
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
cases it's specific in other words I's
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
say would a similarly situated a
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable police officer do this but in
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
a broad sense of society we just assume
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
a reasonable human human being is that
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
you okay so gotcha representative scitec
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I see you uh first I want to thank
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn because your opening
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
remarks articulated what I was trying to
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
say about the helicopter parents and
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
we're we may be micromanaging parenting
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
to some extent I sort of uh my I feel my
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
Sullen this has somewhat been lifted
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
here because of that I I think the idea
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
of number eight Roman 8 by itself while
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
it is it is somebody stole my line I was
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
going to say legislative intent that
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
this just sets a tone for how things are
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
looked at judicially and just you just
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
have a sense that the legislature
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
understands that your reasonable parents
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
do reasonable things and I I would like
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
to just see rep uh section8 as the as
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so what I was
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
thinking um to kind of piggyback off of
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
U what representative Murray was saying
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
is that um I I I think that it would be
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
it would actually accomplish what we
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to accomplish the intent of what
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
we want to accomplish to have something
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
that is um like eight um and otherwise
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
what seven does is it gets into um more
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
specific and it creates more problematic
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
more more problems where um what she
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
what um representative Mario was saying
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
earlier um is the idea that we all have
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a specific situation in our head
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
right and in whether it's helicopter
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
parenting or whether it's the opposite
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
end of that Spectrum um getting to you
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
know what is reasonable and what what
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know where we as a society say these
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
are the parameters of what we think what
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
is acceptable and what is not in the
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child what we're
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
really asking here is to um to make a a
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
statement of intent and say you know uh
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
we want this to be taken into
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
consideration which would also bring it
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
back into line with the other
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that we uh referenced
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
without names um that you know is really
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
just saying hey this would be a good
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
thing to consider when we're um
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
sentencing or or deciding somebody's
 
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.189 align:start position:0%
sentencing or or deciding somebody's
punishment

01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I just want to ask a question
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh and it has to do with if you're
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
trying to make it more bipartisan bill
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
um I was surprised by section two of the
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
law that says in the in the prosecution
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
of any person under this section the
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
tattooing or branding of any person or a
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
child under the age of 20 of 18
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
constitutes endangering the welfare of
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
such child would this would this now
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
make tattooing people legal if
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
you're no because remember if we were
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to amend it and just leave Section
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
8 which says it's a violation it's not a
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
violation of this section for parents to
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow children take reasonable risks and
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
further development of their human
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
beings the the previous part has already
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
clearly delineated needed in in statute
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
would would Trump that in my opinion
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
would would you agree thank you agree
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um okay with with that um
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of work to do
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
today we're going to um we're going to
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh recess this until later on in the day
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
then with that I open the executive
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%

motion representative Manion I would yes
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so we heard this bill last
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
year um we had a subcommittee on it and
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh all the parties uh and all the all
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the parties involved came up with this
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill uh was
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
reintroduced this year however they it
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
the represent representative we'll be
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
taking a vote pretty quick the
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
voting okay it was introduced as the
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
original bill so what this amendment is
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
is this is the amendment that we passed
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
last year in committee it also passed to
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
the house um so for those reasons I
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
would I would suggest we uh adopt this
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and ought to pass thank you
 
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
represent Murray would you like to speak
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
um I agree with my
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
colleague discussion um we passed this
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
last year um I don't know I don't recall
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
what he said happened to it something
 
01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
about the the other body but um I don't
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see any changes um is there any
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on it representative Muse one
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing one of the things that I wanted to
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
say is what the amendment basically does
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
is it puts the bill back into exactly
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing that we sent over to the
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
Senate that was interim studied last
 
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.470 align:start position:0%
Senate that was interim studied last
year

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
um it in a way it it kind of feels like
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
um expecting different results by doing
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing all over again um but um
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
I did support the bill then I was on the
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'll support it again this
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
time uh but I I do wish the sponsor
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
might have done uh a little bit more to
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
get the bill in better shape to actually
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
survive the next step of the process
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the Senate um that
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
the um sponsor spoke to um people over
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
there and they encouraged him to refile
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
it so it might be just one of those um
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
Lucy in the football things again I do
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
not know we'll see representative Manion
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I also want to note
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
that this has the longest sentence if
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
you remember last year uh in any bill
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
that we filed and uh it would be nice to
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
get it into law yes I I always strive
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the Guinness book in my legislation
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
I was just going to um add from my
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
recollection the Senate interim studied
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
it so they could see if similar laws had
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
been passed in other states or if there
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
was any federal law that was in conflict
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
and from what the sponsor said um there
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
was no conflict found um so that uh yeah
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
I do believe it will be passed by the
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
Senate this time God bless you in your
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
memory um with that I would ask you to
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
call the role on the amendment the
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
um so we had a very long bill um the
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it a very short Bill the
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
language was suggested to um
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gathright by
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Linn who happens to
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
be here today he said that his suggested
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
language is not um necessarily an
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
endorsement of the bill just that he
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
said that um for the for the purpose of
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
achieving the intended goal of the bill
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
that this would this language would um
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
fit there was a testimony from the
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
county attorney's
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
office um
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
that judges already have the ability to
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
do what what the bill was trying to
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish um
 
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
and representative Lynn said in
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting this language that it would
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
make it absolutely clear that that um
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
wiggle room is available to judges that
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
discretion is available to judges so
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me and it being my
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
bill I'm fine with this amendment um but
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a lot of opposition I'm open
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
to another motion so that we can take
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
some time over the summer to work on
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
this and but at the same time I think
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
that also the support quarters of the
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
original legislation are satisfied at
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
this point with this wording um and I
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't expect any push back from them and
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
as far as the concerns from the
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
Coalition um I anticipate that the
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
brevity of this um amended version um
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
which would be the entirety of the bill
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
would satisfy their concerns as it
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
relates to the long list of P um
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
offenses that were in the original
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and are now absent in the
 
01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
legislation and are now absent in the
amendment

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
second sorry thank you
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
um um I I fundamentally agree that it's
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
important to just
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
codify the importance of Judges using
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
discretion and considering all factors
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that they
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
do thank you and we're open for
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
SCI I can't help but notice the echo to
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the direction of that we went with
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
1012 can I respond sure um I mean unlike
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
1012 um this just says the court may
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
consider not must consider 1012 gives
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
more I think explicit Direction um in
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
the uh process of determining whether or
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
not to charge someone so the court may
 
01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
not to charge someone so the court may
consider

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
all facts and circumstances which you
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
know if if we are in agreement that this
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
just further
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
clarifies an option that the courts
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
already have then if it is like 1012 in
 
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
either okay I think let's talk about the
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill now um anyone
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
else oh representative
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you um I was part part of
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
the sub subcommittee that um heard this
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
bill and um as I had had stated during
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
those discussions I was not in support
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
of it as written um I do support the
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
amendment um my concern had been prior
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh that it didn't address vulnerable
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
persons as the victim um and I and the
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
number of carve outs I think it just
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
sort of complicated things even though
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
um we've been told that the court
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
already has this ability to to have
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
discretion think this is a a good uh and
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
more broad um reminder and um I think
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's the piece that I know um those
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
that testified had suggested that even
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
though the court had that discrep
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
discretion they didn't feel it was
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
always used so um I support um this 1039
 
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
always used so um I support um this 1039
as

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
amended thank you um I too opposed the
 
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
um the previous version um for for the
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
various reasons that have been discussed
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm trying to find a reason why
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
I should hate this one but it's
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
difficult so um it does seem to do what
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
we said in the previous Bill and so far
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
as it sets a legislative intent that we
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
want you to look at this and and take it
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
into account um even though they may
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
already do so it says just basically
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
while you're sentencing this person keep
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
in mind to the extent you you think it's
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
relevant that they do have other people
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
to care
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
about I think um representative scitec
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
had something more to say or at least I
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
should say representative scitec I'm not
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
very good at reading lips and that's why
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
baseball okay and trouble
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:50.629 align:start position:0%
baseball okay and trouble
[Music]

01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
understanding

01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um yeah I
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
guess I I know we've talked about this
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
but I just want to reiterate the
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment just simplifies the bill
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
removes all the controversial material
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
so that we are ensuring that judges are
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
aware that they do have the discretion
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
to take um this information into
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
consideration when they're creating a
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
sentence um and I think whether we move
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
forward with the amendment and attempt
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill or interim study we
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
should um continue studying this issue
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
over over the summer with all the um
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
Advocates who have um a vested interest
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
in this um and I think the point
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative scitec was trying to make
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
was just that in the way that we
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
simplified 1012 so we could all agreeing
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
it I think that's what we're trying to
 
01:33:39.639 --> 01:33:40.590 align:start position:0%
it I think that's what we're trying to
do

01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
here okay oh thank
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
discussion M Mr chair I have a question
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
or I'm very confused because the the the
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill that I have in in all of my notes
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
so now is the is the amendment wiping
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
out the bill and then just telling a
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
judge that they may do something that
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
they already are aware that they may
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
do um I believe it it replaces the
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
entire Bill and it calls to the
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
attention of the Court similarly to we
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
just discussed in the previous bill that
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants them to um
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
consider this even though they may
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
already um it it gives it a highlight
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't see any mandate that
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
they have to um or
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
that or that it it it says they should
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
give preference to them over versus
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
other um convicted person so I don't I
 
01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.830 align:start position:0%
other um convicted person so I don't I
don't

01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
see I don't see it being any different
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
really than the previous one um but if
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
if if someone else thinks that I'd be
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
happy to hear
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
answer that repr wheeler hold
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
on not this isn't in direct response to
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
your question and actually I might be
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
about to say the same thing as I might
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to Linda actually
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative goth representative goth
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
right yes um if you remember we had
 
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
right yes um if you remember we had
testimony

01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't being used okay we know
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
that the judge has discretion and this
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
was brought about because it was not
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
being used so what we thought what be a
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
good thing after talking to
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Flynn that we would look
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
at um just putting something in there as
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
a remembrance that this is this should
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
happen normally but it's not being
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
happening and that's how the bill came
 
01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:39.470 align:start position:0%
happening and that's how the bill came
before

01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
us okay um as this is a a significant
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
change from what we had prepared to
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
discuss and deal with today I'm going to
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to Res recess this one to the
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
same time it's 10:12 this afternoon and
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
we will take these two bills up again at
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that point um
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
and deal with it then with that I open
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House
 
01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.390 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House
Bill

01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%

01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
1021 and I recognize representative
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
Manion to make a motion thank you Mr
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
chair I make a motion to itl do I have a
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
second seconded by um representative
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
sake would you like to speak to your
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
motion representative Manion I would
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so this bill um is covering a
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
couple different areas in our body word
 
01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.030 align:start position:0%
couple different areas in our body word
camera

01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
camera
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
law one part of it is requiring the
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
defendant to receive a physical copy of
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
the body One camera for defense uh in
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
May of this year the marac
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court ruled that that's what's
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be done so initially whether the way
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
the bill was written and the way body
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
one cams were given out was just a link
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
to it that they could watch the they
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a hard copy of it that
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
case law changed that so that's what
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're doing now another part of this
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill is that the defendant wants the
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
ability to share these and display them
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
as he sees fit that could be on YouTube
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
that could be anywhere else and I'm I'm
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
strongly against
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
that another part of it was exculpatory
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
evidence not to be destroyed uh it's not
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
destroyed I can tell you right now
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
anything that's an arrest is held for
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
minimum of three years uh in most
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
departments and I know the ones I've
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
worked for it's 10 years for felonies so
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's automatically destroyed providing
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
that the case is completely disposed of
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
um it requires a court order we get
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of videos a year
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
so to get a court order for every single
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
one every time one the time has expired
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
on it would be a a Monumental task so
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there's there's the
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
time to do that so most of what this
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to accomplish is already
 
01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.189 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to accomplish is already
being

01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
done thank you representative s would

01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
for a motion thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion of itl I'll second second
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
representative here
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
gaite would you like to speak to your
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
motion representative tenzer uh yes I
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
would thank you Mr chairman uh this bill
 
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
makes driving an uninspected motor
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle a secondary offense in the state
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh currently all of the
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
violations of the rules of the road
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
inspection or registration are primary
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
offenses which means a police officer
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy or Trooper can stop uh stop the
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle I have issues with this because
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to be making a two-tiered
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
system which can gradually make law
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement not able to do their jobs uh
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
the whole goal of law enforcement is to
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
prevent the violation of the law and
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
also to stop the violation of the law um
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh for the record I'm a retired Trooper
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
of the tens of thousands of vehicles I
 
01:39:57.629 --> 01:39:57.639 align:start position:0%
stopped probably thousand or so were uh
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
inspection violations I'll let you know
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
that I did not write much of any tickets
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
on those the whole goal was to let the
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
person know hey by the way you're
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
uninspected get get it fixed whatever
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
you need to do I think that the sponsor
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
also alluded to that this would be a
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
pretext for a search uh that's not going
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
to happen I just think this is a really
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
bad Bill and it just opens up for the
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
problems with law enforcement helping to
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
correct behaviors
 
01:40:24.669 --> 01:40:24.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative got here at
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
gather like speak to you a second well
 
01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
set thank you I I would also like to add
 
01:40:29.719 --> 01:40:31.750 align:start position:0%
set thank you I I would also like to add
that

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
um this claim of a pretextual for search
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
um you can stop a vehicle for just about
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
anything if you don't have problem cost
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
to search you're not searching um so
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
just because you stopped it for a
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
sticker versus a tail light versus
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
anything it doesn't help you get into
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
search of vehicle having said that on
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
often what you see on the outside of a
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
body is indicative of what's going on
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
inside your body and when you see a a a
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
sticker that's expired or
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
whatever sometimes it's indicative that
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
the registration is also expired that
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
their license is un uh has been
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
suspended um and so on and so forth so
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
to to say to our law enforcement enforce
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
these laws this is what we want but kind
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
of don't enforce
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
it sends a horrible message to law
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement so with that oh
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
and maybe representative ly could uh if
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong correct me on this the
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
sterndale decision made your car almost
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
as difficult as your home to search
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
without a warrant so um with that being
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
said in my career and I've been alarm
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
for 30 years if I stop someone for a
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
sticker I'm probably not giving them a
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
ticket uh unless you're driving a brand
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
new mercedesbenz and it's been two years
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
is and you just decided you weren't
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
getting one but maybe I'm just a big
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
softy so I didn't give out a lot of
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
tickets for
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
that thank you if I may
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
inquire in your experience though um is
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
it also not um out of or unusual to find
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the person may also not be
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
registered and may also not have a
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
active license Etc yeah that's been my
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
experience so you find other things uh
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
with it thank you um did you want to say
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair well first I was
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if I could ask my colleague um
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
I was just curious what you meant by a
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system um is that in
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
reference to like some violations being
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
prosec or you know pulled over and some
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
not so yes this uh thank you for the
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
question this would make the uninspected
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle a secondary offense so
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
that I would have to see another offense
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
on top of that before I can even pull
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
you over and I just see that this could
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
now be uninspected then next thing you
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
know it's registration and everything
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
else I just think the police should have
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
the discretion to stop to do their job
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
the way they should and to not start
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
micromanaging all of the the violations
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
of of the
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
statutes thank you can I
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
continue thank you um thank you for your
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
explanation um I guess the one thing I
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to add is that um I I respect
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
obviously all of your experience and
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
what you've seen out in the field but um
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
in my experience as a young person most
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
of the time when I didn't have my car
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors cuz I didn't have the money
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
to inspect it and you know get
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
a a ticket um would have only made that
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
situation worse you know when I was in
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
my early 20s I would dread my birthday
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
every year because I had to pay uh
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
inspection and registration fees um and
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
it just kind of like alarms me a little
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
bit if people are going in with the
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that like because their car
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
is unexpected then they must more than
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
likely be guilty of other
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
offenses um and I think because of that
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
I will be uh voting against the itl
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
motion although again I do respect and
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
understand the perspectives you're
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
bringing to the
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
table thank you representative and I do
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
respect your your opinion and view as a
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
young person I would however um say that
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
there are great many of our criminal
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
statutes that that could possibly be
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
caused by the fact that you know someone
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
just doesn't have the money and um we
 
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
just doesn't have the money and um we
can't

01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I guess I'd I'd rather say
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
we need to fix our economy more than we
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
do our laws um so then you'd have more
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
money to pay for your your
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
Pro and I don't think that's what they
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
said is that they stopped them for uh an
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker and were trying to
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
look for more things wrong they dis
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
appeared right but and and to me
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
inspections are there for safety right
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
that you have brakes so you can stop and
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
all those things um so having your car
 
01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.510 align:start position:0%
all those things um so having your car
not

01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
inspected um can lead to more accidents
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
right because I I see them from time to
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
time where things don't work and or your
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
car just stops in the middle of the road
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
and somebody slams into you so we need
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
to keep our vehicles
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
inspected thank you represent PR that's
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
a that's a really um gets us really back
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
to the point and the point is that we
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
have these for these stickers for safety
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
and it's about the saf of the motoring

01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
criminal justi stuff um representative
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman so I I'm
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
trying to remember and I take a my notes
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
on my little on my little notepad here I
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
guess or my my bill and I do remember
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
when the sponsor was here and we were
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
trying to ask him questions there was a
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that he wasn't able to
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
answer and along that path
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
it kind of came out that he didn't want
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
cars to be inspected at all and he even
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
said that he said well we've been trying
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
for years to make inspection go away and
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
it can't so we thought this would at
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
least be something to get started that
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
was his words um there was a question
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
about you know if your light comes on
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
and you you know you you can't afford to
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
find out what it is you can't afford the
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
the mechanic pretty much every one of
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
the the large box Autoport stores now
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
will tell you what is wrong with your
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
car for free I know for an example
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
because right now I have a light that I
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
can't get off and my car is stalling at
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
red lights it's great I was behind
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
Representative no this morning and
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
almost needed right here um that doesn't
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
cost anything and additionally it is not
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
an injustice to anybody to have to get
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
your car inspected you know all year
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
that it's coming up and you know along
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
with that representative PR said it best
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
like what is the point what is the
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
purpose of an inspection it's not to
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
make anybody feel like it's a gotcha or
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
to have to do something everybody has to
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
do it so you know I I think that we need
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
to take that part into
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%

motion this is uh again going back to
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
the question of do we want um our
 
01:49:09.119 --> 01:49:10.430 align:start position:0%
the question of do we want um our
conversations

01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
recorded um without both people knowing
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a recording
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
um it it there's been it's kind of like
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
the ocean tides it comes in comes out
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
however speaking for myself I do not
 
01:49:25.629 --> 01:49:25.639 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with the idea that I
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
can at any point be having a
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
conversation to with someone personally
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
that I think is private and personal and
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
all the while it being recorded and then
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
later on in the afternoon it's on the
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
internet and it's just it's it's it's a
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
creepy feeling and I we've years we have
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
said that we want our privacy we even
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
put it in the
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution um I just think that this
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a violation of privacy and it also
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
starts getting into questions about
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
what's um domestic issues um people
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
setting people up picking fights with
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
someone and Inter turning on a recorder
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
after the other person's at up and only
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
recording that portion of it it's it
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
just I don't think any good comes from
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
it um representative Ro you want to
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your a second no thank you
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else discussion representative
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
site yeah I'll be opposed to that
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
because I've all we're we're trying to
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
stop technology uh I can have something
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
a pen in my pocket that records it's my
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
right to privacy you can't search me to
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
tell me I can't use my pen uh what
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
should be done with this is the C the uh
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
it should be said that you cannot use
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
that recording for any legal purpose
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
that would be the step I would be
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
willing to take that you could take it
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
you can like I listened to my one time I
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
listened to an accountant doing a lot of
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
technical things and I wanted to mul
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
that over so I I didn't want to be
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking notes I'm trying to concentrate
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
on what he's saying so I let the machine
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
take the notes he didn't like
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
it and that's the point you should ask
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
hey do you mind if I record this so that
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
later on I can do it and if he says I do
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
not want you to record me thank you very
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%

represent M would you like to speak to
 
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
represent M would you like to speak to
your

01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you um this is a bill
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
that was introduced by representative
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
muns and uh what it would essentially do
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
is authorize additional state agencies
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
to take uh f prints of people who are
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
undergo undergoing non-criminal
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
background checks uh so one of the
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
things that came up uh uh during Co is
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
the system that actually does that
 
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
that's operated by the department of
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
safety was very very much overtaxed so
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
part of what this bill is about is if we
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
ever run into a situation like that
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
again um it's being able to take the
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
burden off of the Department of Safety
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't put a burden on to uh
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
employers and state departments and
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
other folks who basically need to uh
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
pass these background checks uh you know
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people they're hiring
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh don't have criminal records and
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so um uh what the
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
amendment uh essentially does is a is is
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of things um uh perhaps the the
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
biggest thing that the amendment does is
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
it changes uh the effective date which
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
was one of the biggest objections uh
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Health and Human
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
Services had um they were concerned uh
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
about potentially about some of the cost
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
C uh and so by moving the effective date
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
out outwards one of the things that that
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
does is it puts us outside the current
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle uh it also allows the task
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
force that would be created um to look
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
at the implementation of the bill it
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
actually gives them time to figure out
 
01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
things like how many machines are needed
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh where are the best places to deploy
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
them how exactly are they going to be
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
deployed and to get a better idea what
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
the potential cost of doing something
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
like that would be uh so uh so
 
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the bill uh was supported by
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
the department of safety they think that
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to take uh part of the
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
burden off of them uh and uh I uh I uh
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%

02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:16.110 align:start position:0%
changed this think you was it you yeah
maybe

02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
um it was making it U more the bill more
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
um fit better with the current statutes
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory placement um Amendment
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bill still is pretty much the same
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
this bill um would make it so that um
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement if they were going to
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
enter on your property that has no
 
02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
trespassing signs they have to honor the
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
no trespassing signs and they have to
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
get a warrant if they need to it still
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
exempts fishing game they can go in the
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
property it exempts exent circumstances
 
02:20:51.070 --> 02:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
if they there's an emergency where
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
evidence could be destroyed or removed
 
02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
um trying to think of all the possible
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
exit and circumstances fishing game
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
issues are are um for example if you
 
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
wound an animal and it runs onto the
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
property you can still get it um
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
basically it's just it's an answer to
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
the age-old um as we heard in testimony
 
02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
Open Fields Doctrine where the US
 
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said that if it's not
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
part of the curtilage which is
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
immediately surrounding your house that
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
use every day law enforcement can go
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
wherever they like on your property and
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want we heard examples
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
of um cameras being placed the sponsor
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
sent me several I challenged him and he
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
met the the challenge he sent me three
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
different cases that have in the
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Juris Prudence where they have
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
cited the the um Open Fields Doctrine um
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
and allowed police to do this I have
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
spoken with representative Lynn he said
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
he's unaware of it so that means the
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
cases are older
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
but the fact that they're old doesn't
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
matter that means they haven't been
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
overturned so theoretically the open
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
field Doctrine still applies in New
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this would as I said require
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to do the same thing
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
they would have to do with your house
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
with your property unless they were the
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions that are already in the uh in
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
the bill such as exent circumstances and
 
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
such they have to get a search warrant
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to Second
 
02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:13.389 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to Second
represent

02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
BRS no thank
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
you discussion represent Newman I would
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
just like some
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
help I would just like some help with
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
the wording of the amendment to find out
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
where I start to compare the various
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
things that have been changed and no
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
longer changed and it's got several laws
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
in here sure let's um let's get the
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
please represent Murray thank you Mr
 
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
chair from what I can remember
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe that this is removing
 
02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
the references to the body camera
 
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
statute yes that's it thank you again
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
for your memory the body camera statute
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
is already covered in statute um if you
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
recall the original Bill said that they
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
had to have their body cameras on
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
whenever they went on the property and
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
um that conflicted with the law we
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
already recently passed regarding body
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
cameras so that's what the amendment
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
does it removes references the body
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
cameras thank you thank
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:21.070 align:start position:0%
cameras thank you thank
you

02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:26.590 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
exactly reing yeah represent wheeler
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm gonna be
 
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
voting oh to to pass on this bill I
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
think you know if it's your property uh
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and you have it posted that the state
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
should not be able to wander on that
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
property and uh the Open Fields dotion
 
02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
seems silly to me if if it it's not
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
posted then the police have the ability
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
to go onto the property that seems
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate and consistent with New
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and I think that if it is
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
posted the police because you have
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
posted it should have to listen to that
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
posting and contact you and get
 
02:24:06.429 --> 02:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
permission to go on your property or get
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
a search warn if needed um so I'll be
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
voting for the aop pass on this you um I
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
I would also I'd like to kind of address
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the hunting issue
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
um because we discussed in a previous
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
Bill about hunting and this kind of
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
references again your personal property
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
our trespass laws in New Hampshire are
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
are pretty detailed um and that's for
 
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
are pretty detailed um and that's for
good

02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
reason you can post your property no
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
trespassing that means nothing you can
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
post your property no hunting that means
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
you can still go hiking walking the
 
02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
police would still be able to walk
 
02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
through there but if Hunters cannot go
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
on there so you could post your property
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
no ATVs you can post it any way you want
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
and be very specific in how you do so
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
and that is what would trigger the
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
trespass part but if you put no
 
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
trespassing that means nobody nothing
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
zero including the police unless they
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
have a warrant so I think that that kind
 
02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
of covers that um representative sake
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just had a question one
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the people who testified was um John
 
02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
J did you say jingle Harbor Schmid maybe
 
02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I can't read my own
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
handwriting here um but from the state
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor who raised concerns
 
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
about um the broadness of all government
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
agents which I don't believe is covered
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
through your Amendment but he um
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
referenced that it would make it
 
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
difficult in terms of
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing um uh inspections uh related
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
to different things like labor laws or
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh conditions in workplaces and I don't
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
see that addressed at all um if you
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
recall I questioned him about that and
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
he admitted that really no because this
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
really applies to single family homes
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't do labor laws in single
 
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
family homes this is about that's about
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
businesses um in a business if they want
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
to enforce labor laws in a business
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to go into the building
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
which is curtilage anyway which isn't
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by this this is about the Open
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine so unless the labor
 
02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
department is going out in the woods
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
behind my house doing something to
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's doing labor out there which
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh I don't even I can't even imagine the
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
scenario I think that they were just
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
being overly cautious um I can't if
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
anyone can think of a scenario where the
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
labor department would need to be in the
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
woods behind your house if you have an
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
elevator in the woods May yeah you could
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a Woods elevator um but beyond that
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
his their duties generally 99% of the
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
time are going to be with industrial
 
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
properties and things of that nature so
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
um once you had admitted that really
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
they were just kind of doing a belt in
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
suspenders I didn't see the need to
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
address that representative um um
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'm kind of in a at a loss
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
here I wasn't here for the public
 
02:26:59.309 --> 02:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
hearing but I will say this uh I am
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
actually a member of a planning board
 
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
and planning board has very large um
 
02:27:08.670 --> 02:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
latitude and and
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
inspection um this would appear that it
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
would apply to members of the planning
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
board Conservation Commission zoning
 
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
board etc etc um whereas the statute
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with those those boards give
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
them the right to inspect at any time
 
02:27:27.269 --> 02:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
without a warrant this is now telling
 
02:27:28.349 --> 02:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
them they have to go get an
 
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
administrative inspection warrant which
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
I think is contrary to what I believe we
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
want already uh well first of all um
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
they can get landowner permission to go
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
look at whatever on their property but I
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't see where any government agency I
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
don't care if it's the planning board
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
whoever should be on the my property
 
02:27:50.269 --> 02:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
without my permission um and if there's
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
a statute that says that they're allowed
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
to traes around my property um finally I
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
I find that offensive I think that it's
 
02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
my property and if I post it no
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
trespassing I mean no trespassing not no
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
trespassing except for people who want
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
to come look at it for planning purposes
 
02:28:08.429 --> 02:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
um you know we may disagree on that but
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's my again we we heard from
 
02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:11.870 align:start position:0%
that's that's my again we we heard from
the

02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
trooper it's your home's Your Castle
 
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's my castle contrary to what the TR
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
said though I did find cases where the
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police have done just that
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
so he he also when I asked him why if
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
they're already doing it why would it
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
hurt to pass the statute and we really
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
didn't get a good answer for that um so
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
and with regard to that I didn't see
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
anyone from the municipal Association
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
here to testify against it and generally
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue with it they would
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
be out against it and we didn't have any
 
02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:42.510 align:start position:0%
be out against it and we didn't have any
contrary

02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
02:28:45.469 --> 02:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Newman i' just
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
like to understand where it says in here
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
that it only applies to single family
 
02:28:53.309 --> 02:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
homes it doesn't it but we're talking
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
about okay let's think about the um the
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
labor department right they're going to
 
02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
not be inspecting in the woods they're
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to be inspecting within the
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
curtilage of a building right so it it
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't say single family homes but
 
02:29:09.309 --> 02:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
where in the world with the labor
 
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
partment I'm just I'm
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
just to single family homes is all I
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to go back to the labor
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
department okay
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say single family homes but
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
the labor Department's concerns again
 
02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
would only apply to within the curtilage
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
of a building anyway representative
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
n so uh I remember that that part of the
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
conversation I remember that the person
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
who is um a representative of the labor
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
department was the person to come here
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
but that it it may apply to a variety of
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
other um people who could be considered
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
a government agent which I think would
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
probably include the uh Planning
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
Commission but um the way that I read
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
this uh you know it also says it says
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding ing any other provision
 
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
of law um so I think if there you know
 
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
are Provisions that allow for the
 
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
planning department or you know
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
inspections and things like that that
 
02:29:56.830 --> 02:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
would be allowed um and then also um
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
upon entering private land a government
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh agent shall immediately notify land
 
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
over ly or occupant if notice can
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably be be made and so it kind it
 
02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
does allow for a little bit of breathing
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
room but um but it's also uh extending
 
02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
the the same rights as your your home to
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
your property thank you representative
 
02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
new I like your explanation much better
 
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
than mine um to representative Jam's
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
point if there's a statute that says the
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
planning board can go on property this
 
02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
is notwithstanding so they can do it um
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
and that would also apply to um
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
assessors and anyone else in who in
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
statute already has the authority to go
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
on a property for whatever government
 
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
business this wouldn't apply to them
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
they are Exempted because of another
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
statute and frankly we could write other
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
statutes in the future and they would
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
Trump this because it says other
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
statutes not withstanding so further
 
02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative here gther
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay so why were you removing five I
 
02:30:57.790 --> 02:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
would believe that you would want that
 
02:31:02.349 --> 02:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
document representative Manion please
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so that's already in
 
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
statute so to add it's already in the
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
body camera statute that anytime you're
 
02:31:13.389 --> 02:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
performing a law enforcement function it
 
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
shall be recorded So to have it in every
 
02:31:18.429 --> 02:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
other statute uh if you add it to
 
02:31:21.309 --> 02:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
investigations or murder whatever kind
 
02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
of other you can't add body cameras to
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
every statute there's a statute
 
02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
governing it already so there's no need
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
to to double up on
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
it so because it's removed doesn't mean
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's not happening it just means it's
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
already covered somewhere else in other
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
words the statue that specifically
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
covers body cameras already requires
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
them to turn them on when they're
 
02:31:41.269 --> 02:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
performing law enforcement functions so
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
it would be redundant to have it in here
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
because then we might as well put body
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
cameras in every statute that the police
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
are involved with instead of do that we
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
put it in one body C statute is that
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
right represent Manu you did better than
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
I did thank you thank you representative
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
Muse I think what we have here is your
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
your classic uh bill in search of a
 
02:32:07.469 --> 02:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
problem um the person who gave the most
 
02:32:10.429 --> 02:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
testimony to public hearing was from an
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
outof State advocacy organization who
 
02:32:15.389 --> 02:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
basically admitted to the fact that he's
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
made passing bills like this his life's
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
work in other states uh we didn't hear
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
from a single property owner who was AG
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
grieved in a situation like this we also
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
um heard from police officers that
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
essentially police officers in New
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are actually trained to
 
02:32:36.429 --> 02:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
respect other people's property when
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
they see that property is posted they
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
contact the property owner um I'm you
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
know I think bills like this are always
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
interested is intellectual exercises um
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
but the fact is is you know with 19
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
bills on the calendar today I I think
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's important that we focus on the ones
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
that actually are going to solve
 
02:32:59.950 --> 02:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
problems uh and I'm just not sure that I
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
see your problem here that needs to be
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
solved thank you thank you I would um I
 
02:33:08.429 --> 02:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
would say that um the vast majority of
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyists we see are either connected to
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
or part of an outof State quote unquote
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
organization and they often write
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislation for legislators so I will
 
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
not use that to detract from any bill
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's before us um with regard to not
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearing from Property Owners um one um I
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe several other people in here are
 
02:33:29.269 --> 02:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
one um and I I I don't want them on my
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
property um and whether or not it's
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
happening I guess we don't we don't
 
02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
leave it to the police um to Boy Scout
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
swear that they're going to do things
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
that we think they should that's why we
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
have the Constitution and um to keep
 
02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
them in line and we also have numerous
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
laws that limit what they can do so um I
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
did find cases where it's happening and
 
02:33:53.710 --> 02:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we it may not be happening
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
every day but we do a lot of
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
prophylactic bills and um I think that
 
02:33:59.950 --> 02:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
this is one of them but we agree to
 
02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
disagree um any further discussion yep
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative here gath um just looking
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
at some of my notes from that day and um
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think it was Chief Walch from Ry that
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
testified yes and he also talked about
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know they believe that the home is
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
Al Castle
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
and um the training at the Academy when
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
in doubt get a
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
warrant um he also mentioned that
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
um the warrant is standard in most
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
cases they get yearly an updated
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
training and they actually were working
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
on the state certification which would
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
say that they would have to have warrant
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
um warrants in some cases um when
 
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um so if this is
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
already I guess cified in their training
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
Academy I would just want to know why do
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
we need that Bill repr Wheeler Mr
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I hear the points made by
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative goth and
 
02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative Muse about training and
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
how this is already the police are
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
already train Tred to protect property
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
rights I made the same point to Chief
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
Walsh when he was here and he didn't uh
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily answer my question I said
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
well you're doing a great job in Rye
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
right now you've got a great Chief there
 
02:35:31.469 --> 02:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
they've got it we've got director skippa
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
he's doing a great job training what's
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
to say 10 20 years down the line there
 
02:35:40.349 --> 02:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
is less of a great director of police
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
standards and training or less of a
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
great chief of police in Ry uh that
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
person might not train their officers to
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
respect property rights as much and
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
legislation statute like this would make
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
it so that it's codified into law by the
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislature that people have a right to
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
their property if it's posted then
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
people can't go on it whether it's the
 
02:36:04.910 --> 02:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
state whether it's Hunters whether it's
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
anybody if it says no trespassing then
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
people cannot trespass and I guess I I
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
just have to make the point because we
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
hear it all the time in this committee
 
02:36:17.550 --> 02:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot rely on the training standards
 
02:36:21.269 --> 02:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
of an administrative agency um you know
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's the racial profiling bill
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
or anything else we we hear all the time
 
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
that it's codified into training but
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's not happening and I think it's
 
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
important sometimes for the legislature
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
to take action to codify some
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
administrative action for that agency
 
02:36:37.550 --> 02:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what this does thank you
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
represent Manion you good um
 
02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:42.070 align:start position:0%
represent Manion you good um
representative

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I have a problem with this
 
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
La I feel that it's it we are already
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a Supreme Court decision that says
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're in an open field a big large area
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
away from any any residence or whatever
 
02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking
 
02:36:57.389 --> 02:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
about um that th this bill requires that
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
you can get the consent all the time in
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's section
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh four says unless entering on the land
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the consent or ex
 
02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
exent circumstances a government agent
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
shall show the so show the search
 
02:37:16.110 --> 02:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
warrant authorizing entry into to the
 
02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
property owner um and it all and it and
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
it starts to use the word instead of
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
secured premises it uses private land
 
02:37:26.349 --> 02:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have a definition for
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
private land so I assume that means any
 
02:37:30.910 --> 02:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
any land that that land owner was so I
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
think it's too broad I think it violates
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
an already existing us constitutional
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
law that says that you have no right to
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
privacy in an open field so I'm going to
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
vote against this law thank you thank
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
you um for clarification on open field
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
open field is kind of a catch-all word
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily mean what you
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
feel you picture is you know the fields
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
of barley it's not that it it just means
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
the property that is not the curtilage
 
02:38:01.950 --> 02:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
so I I own 6 acres and I get a pool and
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
probably 20 ft beyond that it's no
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
longer the curtilage um when I'm mowing
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
it sometimes it feels like an open field
 
02:38:10.349 --> 02:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
but it's just my lawn and Beyond that's
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
a couple acres of woods also not an open
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
field but that's considered the open
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
field so that's it's not a
 
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional law it's interpretation
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution and we can't stop
 
02:38:25.389 --> 02:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
federal agents with this law they can
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
ignore it and they can say Open Fields
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
until there's a federal law but our
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement officers would
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
have to honor this and not go into my
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
Open Fields um but your point is well
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
taken and we agree to disagree um
 
02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.750 align:start position:0%
taken and we agree to disagree um
representative

02:38:40.750 --> 02:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
Pratt well I'm a land owner and I'm also
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of this law anybody that wants
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
to leave their property open for
 
02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
everybody to walk on just doesn't have
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
to put the signs up all this does is it
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
makes it clearer that if you put a no
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign up no means no no
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
trespassing means no trespassing it's
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
all this bill does if you don't want
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
that to happen if you want people to be
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
able to walk across your property
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
anytime they want you just don't put the
 
02:39:07.269 --> 02:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
signs up simple as that thank you I I
 
02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
would assume that you could even post
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
your property no law enforcement if if
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's what you wanted to post it um we
 
02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
are very uh like I said are are no
 
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
trespass laws are very uh complicated um
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
with that I would ask the clerk to call
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
the role the motion on the floor is of
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%

second representative
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
PR oh would you like to speak to your
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
motion representative rhods sure so I do
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the well I think I do
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
understand the the intention of the
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor with this bill um there are
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
already rest restorative justice
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
programs in in the state I I know for
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
fact I am on one for the the county um
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
they actually work quite well
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
um basically if a if a minor commits a
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
crime they have the option to the judge
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
can say hey look we're going to you know
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
have you go this path um kind of try to
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
write you're wrong and then when the
 
04:02:59.070 --> 04:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
program is complete the charges are
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
never filed they just they they
 
04:03:01.479 --> 04:03:03.030 align:start position:0%
never filed they just they they
disappear

04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
04:03:06.149 --> 04:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
um I was a little bit confused because
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
there already is something in existence
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
I was a little conf confused on the
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of this um but I also
 
04:03:15.070 --> 04:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
think that you know you have the option
 
04:03:18.030 --> 04:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
to go meet with your District Attorney's
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
Office you can meet with your local
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
police departments I just don't think we
 
04:03:23.229 --> 04:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
have to have a a law that gives you the
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
right to do that because everything that
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
is wanted to be done can can already be
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
done without a law to do it
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pro would you like to
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
second no I think she covered that quite
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you okay I I just like to
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
start by I do want to point out that um
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's not only a restorative justice but
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
it was the hate crimes portion that the
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I'm sure she's going to tell
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
us um was interested in um the reason
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
and probably the majority if not the
 
04:03:54.910 --> 04:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
entire reason that I I'm not in favor of
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
this is isn't anything to do so much
 
04:04:00.349 --> 04:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the subject matter as um we've
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
heard from a speaker and the clerk um
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
about these committees and commissions
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
and um we are we have so many of them
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that um are because once we do this it's
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
on the law forever um the committee or
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
commission will expire obviously because
 
04:04:17.550 --> 04:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's a committee they only have till
 
04:04:19.070 --> 04:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
September to come up with some kind of
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
report um but the the marching orders
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
we've kind of gotten is unless it's
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary um if it can't be
 
04:04:30.030 --> 04:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
done some other way we shouldn't be
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
doing new committees or commissions I
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
feel like this is an important topic
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to the hate crimes and
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
juveniles a lot of them are getting
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
caught up in this but I I don't feel we
 
04:04:41.950 --> 04:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
need to codify it and and I think we can
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work on on ourselves we can
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
figure stuff out and come up with ideas
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
without putting in statute um again
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
though that's just one one person's
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
opinion and I'm going to uh open it for
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussion and I know without even
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
talk oh sure
 
04:05:05.229 --> 04:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
okay sure come on and come up yeah
 
04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
representative new and I saw you out of
 
04:05:09.630 --> 04:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
the corner of my represent Muse thank
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
you um I think uh you know Point well
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
taken I guess about the Committees and
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
and commissions and things like that
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
what it really comes down to I guess is
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
how you prioritize it right and and what
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
you think is really important I do
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand especially because um uh
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
because uh we are in the same uh County
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
that this is happening in our County um
 
04:05:32.910 --> 04:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that I have heard in in you
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
know about the the success in in our
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
school system and and uh in our County
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
and things like that um um is that it
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
has been helpful um and I think that you
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
know what we do here is not just for our
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
own counties although we do that as well
 
04:05:47.149 --> 04:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
um but you know we try to say hey this
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
is working really well in in this County
 
04:05:50.670 --> 04:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we can take that information we
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
can um you know see what's happening in
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
other counties and and really come up
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
with something that um is helpful on a
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
state level so I feel like this is still
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
very much worth doing um you know even
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
if we are busy I think we should make it
 
04:06:06.550 --> 04:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
a priority so thank you forther
 
04:06:09.429 --> 04:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
discussion representative wheeler
 
04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm going to be
 
04:06:13.630 --> 04:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl motion I
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the clerk's position on
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
committees and study committees and
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
things like that um this is I feel is an
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
important uh committee to move forward
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
and and I'm sure um knowing how
 
04:06:28.149 --> 04:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
passionately representative selig feels
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
about this and how passionately other
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives feel that there would be
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
membership for this committee um so I
 
04:06:37.149 --> 04:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support this uh I think
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
that even even if it fails though that
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
there would be a way to move forward
 
04:06:45.070 --> 04:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
with one of the existing commissions or
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
committees that exist uh
 
04:06:50.149 --> 04:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
already are given statute
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
statutory uh charge from us um to have
 
04:06:56.349 --> 04:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
them look at Best Practices for
 
04:06:59.950 --> 04:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
juveniles uh getting these charges and
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
going into juvenile uh prison I'm saying
 
04:07:05.229 --> 04:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
even if this bill fails or comes out
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
1010 which it seems like it might that
 
04:07:09.429 --> 04:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
they're I think is a consensus that
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
there might be a
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
good it could be a good impetus to move
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
forward to start looking at how we can
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue which seems to be
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
one thank you good points representative
 
04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:23.590 align:start position:0%
one thank you good points representative
um

04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah so we're we're at a point
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
where where hate crimes are basically On
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
The Rise uh in New Hampshire and
 
04:07:32.910 --> 04:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a fair number of the
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
people uh who are being apprehended for
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
those crimes when they are apprehended
 
04:07:41.109 --> 04:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
are juveniles and um I think one of the
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
things that I that we try to do in our
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is to put young
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
people like that into a position where
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
they can more effectively begin to make
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
decisions and do things that can kind of
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
turn their lives around um and I think
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
we've all read instances of people who
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
were involved with hate groups when they
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
were young and had different experiences
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
and wound up feeling a you know feeling
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
a different way um you know to me if if
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have the State Attorney
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
General's office you know just recently
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
beefing up its ha hate crime division um
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
if if we if we didn't actually have a an
 
04:08:27.550 --> 04:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
issue in New Hampshire with it um I I
 
04:08:29.429 --> 04:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
think I'd agree with you I'm I'm not a
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
big fan of creating study committees for
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
the stake of creating study committees
 
04:08:37.149 --> 04:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
um but you know this is an example of
 
04:08:37.159 --> 04:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
um but you know this is an example of
where

04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know an area where I I think people
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
who have a little bit of experience with
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
the law and I would consider most of us
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
as having a little bit of experience can
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
draw in people with a lot more
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
experience and maybe come up with some
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
solutions that could put us in a better
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
place um and uh you know that's why I I
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
I like the bill when uh representative
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
Cel uh put it forward and and why I
 
04:09:03.359 --> 04:09:04.389 align:start position:0%
Cel uh put it forward and and why I
support

04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
you pres selig and and could you could
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
you explain I know we've already gone
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
over just explain what the committee
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
would do thank you so um my motivation
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
for the committee is really the
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
combination of I think being a former
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
teacher and teaching High School level
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
students uh being a parent of teenagers
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
and um knowing how easy it is for
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
teenagers to be swayed by their peers to
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
make core choices at times choices that
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
in uh moments of better thinking and
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
being their best selves they wouldn't
 
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
choose to make but um sometimes those
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
impulsive actions have really serious
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
consequences and um I was thinking about
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
that a lot over the summer at the same
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
time as there were a number of hate
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
crimes increasing across the state um as
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
well as within my own child's uh high
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
school there were a number of of
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
significant incidents in in sorry my St
 
04:10:04.239 --> 04:10:05.229 align:start position:0%
significant incidents in in sorry my St
in

04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
instances um getting my out is getting
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
trickier um so thinking about all of
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
those things and then at the same time I
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
was reading about the success of the
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
Teen Court programs in Maryland which
 
04:10:20.189 --> 04:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
are not restorative justice programs
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
designed by adults for for teens but
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
programs designed by teens for teens um
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
where they were ultimately coming up
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
with models that were um had a 90 4%
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
success rate in many cases um so very
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
very few kids were ending up coming back
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
into needing additional situations and
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
thinking was there a way to put together
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
something like the Teen Court program
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
which no longer exists in New Hampshire
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out why it doesn't
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
exist is it a matter of we don't have
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
the resources for it or is it a matter
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
of truly it doesn't work here and and
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
nobody could answer that for me when I
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
made those initial calls so trying to
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
figure that out we have in some counties
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
we have youth diversion programs but not
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
in every County in some districts we do
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
in others we don't so trying to think
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
about okay we've got all these dispar
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
pieces how can we put it all together to
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
make sense out of it in a way because my
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is not to have kids end up
 
04:11:16.830 --> 04:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the judicial system at all but to
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
help them learn why it is they're doing
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
what they're doing so that they'll make
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
better choices in the future and and
 
04:11:25.710 --> 04:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
ideally break the cycle right break it
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
completely so that rather than someone
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
going into say a juvenile detention
 
04:11:32.070 --> 04:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
center and then aligning themselves with
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
people with misguided hateful ideas and
 
04:11:38.189 --> 04:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of that and being more likely
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
to end up in the adult judicial system
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we get them out of it completely
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe the next time their friends
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
say hey let's go do this really stupid
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
act they're like no we shouldn't do that
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what I learned you
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
really should we don't want to do that
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where my motivation came from
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
but trying to figure out how to put all
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
those pieces together into something
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
meaningful there were so many different
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
partners I spoke to and they're like oh
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea you could try this or
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
you could try this and so just trying to
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
bring people together so we could make
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
something sensible out of it
 
04:12:11.229 --> 04:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
at the same time who who's on your
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee who's on my who I yeah no who
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
who would be on it in the bill I know
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
the copy in front of me I'm sorry I'm
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
all disassembled
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
here so um uh representative Alicia Greg
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro County I reached out to I
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
spoke to obviously no no no I I mean who
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
members of the House oh who is the
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
makeup of the committee it's a total of
 
04:12:34.720 --> 04:12:36.229 align:start position:0%
makeup of the committee it's a total of
um

04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
Senate uh three members of the House of
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives and one member of the
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and then the other outside people
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
appointed to it or just no because it's
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
a study committee so you can't right
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
require them I did have um a long
 
04:12:51.309 --> 04:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
um with um Sean Lock from um the
 
04:12:59.149 --> 04:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office um and when he
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
first called me he was very skeptical of
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
my bringing this forward and at the end
 
04:13:04.590 --> 04:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
he said it was a conversation he'd like
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
to be part of and he he would want his
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
office to get involved in that we've had
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
some additional conversations and then
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
right before we went to hearing on this
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
his Department went from him to like
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
four people and so I didn't hear back
 
04:13:20.910 --> 04:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
from him because I'm pretty sure he was
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to supervise
 
04:13:24.109 --> 04:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
his three new people in grow his newly
 
04:13:26.429 --> 04:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
growing Department um I also spoke to
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
Tom bardi um who's now uh in the
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office he was very
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
involved in creating restorative justice
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
programs in straford County before he
 
04:13:37.109 --> 04:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
moved to the uh State's attorne
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
attorney's office so um and with the
 
04:13:42.990 --> 04:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU as well and their support um and I
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
spoke to someone from restorative
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
justice I just don't have their name at
 
04:13:47.109 --> 04:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
the top of my head and do you feel like
 
04:13:48.510 --> 04:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
you could accomplish what you want to
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish in three months um I feel
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
like we could accomplish a lot we might
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
not accomplish everything but we might
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with some answers in
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
some ways that would be
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
meaningful um representative Balden oh
 
04:14:02.109 --> 04:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me no representative Muse did you
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
have your hand up or did you already
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
speak you already spoke representative
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.429 align:start position:0%
speak you already spoke representative
Bolton

04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
Bolton
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like instead of deciding on
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
your own as a lawmaker how to solve this
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
problem you're just suggesting that time
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
be spent by a committee of people
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to solve this problem I
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
I respect that I think it's um
 
04:14:27.149 --> 04:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
refreshing for a New Hampshire state
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative to not think they have
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
answers yeah to can I could my I know I
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
was thinking about changing my vote
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
until she said that so oh I mean my my
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
idea my idea is really to look at what's
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
best practices for all kids that it's
 
04:14:42.910 --> 04:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
not a partisan issue it's really an
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
issue just of how do we figure out
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
something that's going to best serve the
 
04:14:50.109 --> 04:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
kids across the state and hopefully also
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
if we can avoid having them end up in
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
any form of the judicial system save us
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.510 --> 04:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
money represent Reed thank you Mr
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
chairman this um peer-led group where
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
would this take place would it be at at
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections would it
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
be at a school would it be at a
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
community center where do you envision
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
this taking place that's a great
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
question and why I need a study
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee so we can look at all the
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
different possibilities and what would
 
04:15:18.109 --> 04:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
actually work for some of these things I
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
don't even know if it would still work
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the state I know it's working in
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
other states and so again there was one
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
in marac but there wasn't in any other
 
04:15:29.670 --> 04:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
part of the state and I don't know they
 
04:15:31.510 --> 04:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
said it disbanded in part because of the
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
um pandemic and whether it couldn't be
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
restarted or whether it's just that
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's not the funds I don't know the
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
answers and the people I reached out to
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.830 --> 04:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
point follow up um I think it's a great
 
04:15:49.950 --> 04:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
idea I just would not want to see it
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
with everything going on in schools
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
right now I'd rather see I would like to
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
see something like that in a different
 
04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
setting so that they can focus on
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
academics get more back on track in the
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
schools so what they learn that the
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
committee should be extra
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
right this this wouldn't be a school
 
04:16:11.469 --> 04:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
based thing this would be a study
 
04:16:13.630 --> 04:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
committee to figure out how to deal with
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
these issues and if you would like to be
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
on the study committee I'm sure that can
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
be arranged with the speaker with your
 
04:16:23.389 --> 04:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
support all right so um given a
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussion um I'm inclined to to change
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
my position so I'm going to tell um my
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
members you can vote however you want um
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you're inclined to
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
support um I would uh entertain uh
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
removal of the itl motion just to save
 
04:16:41.149 --> 04:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
us from doing two different votes if you
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
wish to move forward that's obviously
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
you're right and we can have that vote
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
too who made the motion I didn't say one
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely so um if if I may this
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
is uh uh to representative selig
 
04:16:58.349 --> 04:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
the so what I was what I was trying to
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
say is that the restorative justice
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
program and just the in general I guess
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
if I want to say the redirection program
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
program that that we have at the county
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
level you would probably be welcome to
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
join us for for one of those um and I
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
think it would probably answer a lot of
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions you have and maybe help with
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
the direction that you're that you're
 
04:17:24.109 --> 04:17:24.119 align:start position:0%
trying to go
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of what I was getting at
 
04:17:26.560 --> 04:17:27.790 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of what I was getting at
is

04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
that a lot of what you're trying to
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish could be
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
answered could be answered with that
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
without necessarily having to have it
 
04:17:38.109 --> 04:17:38.119 align:start position:0%
put into law that's that's what I was
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get at it might answer a lot
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the questions that you have so that's
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:17:45.960 --> 04:17:49.149 align:start position:0%
that was
that

04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
repres I want very much to be wrong I
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
want this to work but I don't believe it
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
I would like to see the
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
results because I see
 
04:18:04.590 --> 04:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
these life's cadavers walking the
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
hallways and I don't know how you reach
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
them if I ask them for a pass I'm going
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
fight and for every legislator I see
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
who's recovered from drugs and has come
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
back and leading a wonderful life
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's and I'm not I shouldn't have
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
used wonderful letter um there
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
are many who I don't I don't know the
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
numbers who've committed suicide who've
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
lost their lives and to Pivot this on
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that we may Rescue of a
 
04:18:38.960 --> 04:18:41.710 align:start position:0%
the fact that we may Rescue of a
precious

04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
few I want to be wrong but I just don't
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
I don't I if I get out voted that's
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
great I want I want I want to lose I or
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
I want you to succeed but I don't I'm I
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little bit jaist I don't
 
04:18:59.550 --> 04:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
think we approach this and I'll finish
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
with this from the mentality of
 
04:19:05.710 --> 04:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
irrational adults who know best who who
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
would not you don't even think about
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
littering okay how do you can transmit
 
04:19:11.040 --> 04:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
littering okay how do you can transmit
those

04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
values to somebody who's a vict who
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
traffics and hate crimes who has
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely no interest in society
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
that this is I I I realize I'm sort of
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
more more jaundice than I should be but
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's how I that's my life's experience
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
and how I'm approaching this thank you
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative scitech and
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
we are great greatly concerned about
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
your liver um representative sing so
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
again I'm not thinking I'm going to
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
solve everything with this um they're
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the people like our friend
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
who likes to send us letters um on a
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis who are going to continue
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
to be full of hate for anyone who isn't
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
just like he is but with kids more times
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
than not it's because they've been
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
they've gone down a rabbit hole and if
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
you can get them the right ladder to get
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
them back out of that rabbit hole you
 
04:20:08.109 --> 04:20:08.119 align:start position:0%
can avoid a lot of problems and if we
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
can catch them early and identify things
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
and so again the goal of this is really
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
to look at what do we have that is
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
working and I hope we have more programs
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
working than it appears from where I sit
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
but what's working what what can we be
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
doing better and and what are the other
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
options so maybe there are other things
 
04:20:28.149 --> 04:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
but again my goal is in having a study
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
group is to bring together constituents
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
from different angles to try to figure
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
that out collaboratively so that maybe
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
you'll be put out of business as a bale
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner at least in relation to
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
this crime okay now you're getting crazy
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
um you had me until you went off the
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
real um all right so there's of
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
hands representative Newman don't snatch
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
Victory from the mouth of no I'm just
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
thinking I never try to snatch Victory
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
but I don't a lot of times I get too
 
04:20:59.399 --> 04:21:01.950 align:start position:0%
but I don't a lot of times I get too
many

04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
defeats I just think that this is a good
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
thing we've been to drug court and we
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
saw how much they thought that was a
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
valuable thing to do because it kept
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
somebody out of the criminal justice
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
system and I'd like to see that
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
accomplished and this might be the
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a little bit of
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
effort that might get us to understand
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not we could do that with
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't make a law I mean it
 
04:21:30.189 --> 04:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
something we ought to I think we should
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
follow I I I I agree I mean it doesn't
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
cost anything but time and and um just
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be clear clear before anyone makes
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
any or removes any
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
motions anyone who worked on the bill
 
04:21:43.389 --> 04:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
last summer is probably not going to
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
want to be on this I'm going hunting I
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't care what study committee I'm not
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
being part of it um so representative um
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
rhods would you um entertain which are
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
on your
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
motion I will withdraw it hoping that
 
04:21:59.309 --> 04:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
someone else makes it and writes the
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
report um who made the second that would
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
be me and I will withdraw my second okay
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%

the
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um changes things a little bit
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.389 --> 04:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
0851 and um the reason for the amendment
 
04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
let me just talk a little bit about kind
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
of what the reason for the bill was in
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
the first first place um the reason for
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
the bill was because people who were
 
04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
being brought in under protective
 
04:24:46.510 --> 04:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
custody um were uh there was some
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
um lack of resources at the end of the
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
day right so there were not the
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to satisfy the law
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
in the way that it's stated statutorily
 
04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
and so this was kind of a solution to
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
saying we don't necessarily always have
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
a medical professional on staff um as
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
was testified to um thoroughly um there
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
may maybe kind of during business hours
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
Monday to Friday 9 to 5 that type of
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
thing um but on the weekend there's a
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot less of um uh it's it's there isn't
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
the Staffing to be able to do this at a
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
correctional correctional facility and
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
so the idea of doing this bill was uh uh
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
was to try and get everyone into
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
compliance um since it was required um
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
that someone who is uh being held in
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
protective custody and they were going
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
to be held at the local jail or in the
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
correctional facility um
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
so this was uh bringing them into
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
compliance since the liability would be
 
04:25:43.469 --> 04:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
on them so we had a lot of discussion uh
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
when we heard about the bill um as it
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
was introduced um about
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
um uh problems throughout so anyway but
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
but what this bill what this amendment
 
04:25:56.349 --> 04:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
aims to do is just to really get at the
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
heart of what the issue was why this
 
04:25:59.229 --> 04:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
bill was brought in the first place to
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
get to uh to to resolve the issue that
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
it was trying to resolve in the first
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
place and so what it does is it removes
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
two things they they say the same thing
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the law um no
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
person shall be lodged in a local jail
 
04:26:12.429 --> 04:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
or County Correctional Facility under
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 unless the person um in
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
charge of the the facility immediately
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
upon uh lodging said person in
 
04:26:20.910 --> 04:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
protective custody contacts that uh a
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
designated drug counselor a clinical
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
staff person of an approved drug
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
treatment program with
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
detoxification um capabilities or a
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
professional medical staff person at a
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
licensed General Hospital emergency room
 
04:26:35.469 --> 04:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
to determine what that uh whether said
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
person is in indeed uh incapacitated if
 
04:26:40.149 --> 04:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
and only if none of the forgoing is
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
available such medical or clinical
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
determination shall be made by a
 
04:26:45.550 --> 04:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
registered nurse or registered emergency
 
04:26:47.950 --> 04:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
medical technician on the staff of the
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
Detention Facility so there there is no
 
04:26:53.950 --> 04:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
um outside of essentially business hours
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
there is no uh registered nurse or uh
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
registered emergency medical um
 
04:27:03.109 --> 04:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
technician at the facility um outside of
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
essentially business hours so on the
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
weekend and things like that so if
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's brought in for protective
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
custody then it becomes okay who is the
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
liability on is it on the officer who is
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
bringing it to uh bringing this person
 
04:27:15.389 --> 04:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
um to the facility or is it on the
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
facility once they get there and so it's
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
created some kind of back and forth
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
about um who would who would essentially
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
be liable for that and what we've had is
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
we've had people being turned away um
 
04:27:26.910 --> 04:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
from Correctional Facilities because
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
they do not have a person on staff to be
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
able to do that so it's a matter of
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
whose judgment it is so the sponsor
 
04:27:34.750 --> 04:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
brought this amendment um representative
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
Shapiro brought this amendment so that
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
he could um kind of cut away all of the
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
other things and still try to address
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
the essential problem that was happening
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
in the first place so taking out that
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
section of law um kind of alleviates the
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
liability did I do a terrible job of
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
explaining that CU I feel like I'm
 
04:27:55.630 --> 04:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.990 --> 04:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
guys if we could just um just have you
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
know what um I'd like uh 10 minutes I I
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
want to read the actual statute so I can
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
bump it up against the amendment um
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:34:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
we are back
 
04:34:29.070 --> 04:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
on and it's now discuss continued
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment um last
 
04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
person who spoke I believe was
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh n um anyone else
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak on the
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
amendment very quickly so basically the
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
amendment repeals the whole bill and
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
just replaces it with these three
 
04:34:47.400 --> 04:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
just replaces it with these three
lines

04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
no a new section of law if I'm not
 
04:34:53.000 --> 04:34:54.910 align:start position:0%
no a new section of law if I'm not
mistaken

04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
um repeal the statute doesn't say repeal
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the amendment it says amend the bill
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
by replacing everything after the enact
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
all after the enacting Clause with the
 
04:35:05.629 --> 04:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
following so it repeals everything else
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was in the draft except for this
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
okay doesn't look like we need help does
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
it Kate Horan New Hampshire Association
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
of counties so this isn't amending the
 
04:35:23.470 --> 04:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
bill this is this amendment amends the
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
statute and only takes out the piece
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that says we have to immediately
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate someone when they are in the
 
04:35:31.709 --> 04:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
correctional facility because if they
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
are so intoxicated that they cannot form
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
sentences regardless of whether or not I
 
04:35:38.590 --> 04:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
have medical staff on board I can't
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate them or counsel them about you
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
know getting getting services that is
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
all this bill does it takes out the
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
concerns of the police Chiefs and the
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
sheriffs um so it just focuses on
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
removing that section of law so if
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking at just the amendment you
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
can forget the bill and just look at
 
04:35:56.959 --> 04:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
can forget the bill and just look at
current

04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.400 --> 04:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
statute

04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we seem to have a we seem to
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
have a um okay so let's just all go
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
through it together
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
class repeal the following are repealed
 
04:36:11.959 --> 04:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
class repeal the following are repealed
RSA

04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
1725 um Roman three relative to contact
 
04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
requirements regarding incapacity

IND RSA 172 B3 relative to contact
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
requirements incapacity taken in EV so
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing all after
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause what is the enacting
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause Mr chairman says
 
04:36:41.470 --> 04:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
being enacted by the Senate and House of
 
04:36:42.750 --> 04:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
Representative and general court
 
04:36:45.070 --> 04:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
convened that's the enacting Clause so
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
replaced are all gone it yeah it says
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
after the enacting Clause so it's the
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
the wording of the bill just no I'm okay
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
takes it all
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
away except for those two things well
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
bust my buttons twice today I'm going to
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
change my my mind um all right so having
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
said that everything I just told
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
everyone in the room that we don't talk
 
04:37:16.830 --> 04:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
about is is
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
gone no that's gone that that wipes all
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
that out making sure yeah that actually
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
took a bill that in my opinion was not
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
so good and fixed some law that was
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
already bad um so what's not to like
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
um oh so everything we've everything
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
we've just discussed however is um
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
immaterial until I get a second to the
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment you move
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
to oh okay all right
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
good yeah got it okay
 
04:37:53.470 --> 04:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
so just I want to State it for all the
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
members the bill that we had is now for
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
the most part except for being enacted
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
by the house gone this new bill strikes
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
out the two places in law where it said
 
04:38:07.869 --> 04:38:07.879 align:start position:0%
that they had to do a medical evaluation
 
04:38:10.150 --> 04:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
on somebody the moment they arrived for
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
protective custody
 
04:38:14.349 --> 04:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
only obviously we heard from law
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement if someone's got an obvious
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
injury they're getting them treated um
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
they're calling an ambulance or what
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
have you they're not bringing them all
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
broken to the jail and if the jail sees
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
they're all broken they're calling an
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
ambulance I mean in other words no one's
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
getting tucked away with obvious
 
04:38:32.910 --> 04:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
injuries that they're only can be held
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
for a maximum 24 hours so having someone
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
evaluated to talk about um you know
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
their their absess Moler or whatever
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
else irrelevant they most of them don't
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
stay the 24 hours somebody comes and
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
gets them I think this saves our
 
04:38:47.949 --> 04:38:47.959 align:start position:0%
counties a lot of money it doesn't put
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
anybody in any risk um I'm not seeing
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
the downsides any further discussion
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
um my only concern is if we're saying an
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation doesn't need to be done if
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
someone is brought in um um you know on
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
drugs or something and they're not
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
evaluated is there not a possibility of
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
them going into an overdose wall in a
 
04:39:16.590 --> 04:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
cell or like some other medical
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
emergency that could happen because they
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
were not evaluated upon entry it is my
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that people that are in
 
04:39:24.429 --> 04:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
protective custody are monitored um the
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
entire time they're there so it's not
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
like normal incarcerated guests who are
 
04:39:30.510 --> 04:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
just you know here's your celce in the
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
morning the people that are in PC are
 
04:39:34.830 --> 04:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
monitored um all night long because
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
because of the fact they're there
 
04:39:38.350 --> 04:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
because they are intoxicated um so if
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
they were to example OD and fall out I
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
would imagine within moment somebody
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
would be there with our can and they'd
 
04:39:46.270 --> 04:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
be calling the wagon to come get them
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
chairman um I don't understand I mean it
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that law enforcement
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
has a good handle on this and they've
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
been dealing with these situations for a
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
long time so why are we presenting a
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
bill I don't feel is necessary be happy
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
to tell you please yeah so if you look
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
at the statute the protective custody
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute the problem we've had is at some
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
point in the past somebody put in there
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
to protect people I would assume from
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
being put into protective custody who
 
04:40:19.150 --> 04:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
didn't need it that they would be
 
04:40:21.390 --> 04:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
medically evaluated for the sole purpose
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
if you read the statue to ensure they
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
are indeed
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
incapacitated um times have advanced um
 
04:40:30.430 --> 04:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
now there's no way that the people in
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
the jail and the cops are all going to
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
be in and put a sober person in there
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
nobody wants at risk they've invented
 
04:40:39.390 --> 04:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers recently so what it's done is
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
remained in statute and now they're
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
starting to play Hot Potato with human
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
beings well we don't want to hold them
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
well we don't want to hold them U it's
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's horrible it's calling staffing
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
issues it's causing so the original bill
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
I did not like because it was huge
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
ponderous this fixes the law which is
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
really what needed to be done in my
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
opinion further discussion and as I
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
understand it is that oh without
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
removing these pieces
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
somebody has to evaluate them formally
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes right whether it's a drug counselor
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever that may not be on staff so
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
that removes that piece because I would
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
like to think law enforcement
 
04:41:23.550 --> 04:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
Correctional and whoever can after a
 
04:41:25.708 --> 04:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
little bit of experience can determine
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
whether somebody needs to be sent to the
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
hospital or they're all set to stay here
 
04:41:35.310 --> 04:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
so they don't need some uh person with
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
alphabets after their name to get called
 
04:41:40.190 --> 04:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
in or whatever to say
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
that thank you and again I'd point out
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
the existing statute that calls for this
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
eval is not for their health it's only
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
to see if they're intoxicated so I think
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
that to your point law enforcement knows
 
04:41:53.550 --> 04:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
if someone's intoxicated and so does the
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
jail uh hold on representative Murray
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
Murphy did you have something uh thank
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
you yes I I just want to see um in my
 
04:42:02.430 --> 04:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
notes I look back and it and um it seems
 
04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
that section three of 172 B3 was the
 
04:42:07.628 --> 04:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
biggest concern of the superintendent of
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
Chester County Department of Corrections
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that Captain Dustin parin agreed
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
that taking that section out would not
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
create any negative impacts so there was
 
04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
agreement on on that yes I I agree I
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
believe the superintendent said if
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
you're not going to do anything else at
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
least do that then we're going to at
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
least do that representative s just to
 
04:42:28.270 --> 04:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
clarify y um but this this type of
 
04:42:30.670 --> 04:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
incapacitation is both drug related as
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
well as alcohol related correct I just
 
04:42:35.070 --> 04:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very yeah
 
04:42:35.080 --> 04:42:37.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very yeah
um

04:42:37.230 --> 04:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
discussion represent minion thank you
 
04:42:45.510 --> 04:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is the ghost Corner over here
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I agree so if you get somebody
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
that they're going to evaluate and they
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody on staff it's two in
 
04:42:51.310 --> 04:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
the morning because that's when most
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
people are drinking heavily or people I
 
04:42:56.590 --> 04:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
know anyways um and they got to call
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
somebody in that could take two three
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
four hours to get somebody to come in
 
04:43:01.390 --> 04:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
that person could be soed up by then so
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
it really I mean it's really a mood
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
point so I agree that moving these
 
04:43:07.470 --> 04:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
sections would be beneficial and in that
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
time while whoever it is is coming from
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
wherever they're coming to do this
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
someone can come and pick them up and
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're gone and the whole exercise was
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
a waste of time and money and it just
 
04:43:19.470 --> 04:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense okay so the
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
motion um is to adopt the amendment R by
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative new um I would ask the C
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%

04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%

to your motion represent man yes thank
 
04:45:45.310 --> 04:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so this is a bill that we
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
passed last year um repealing
 
04:45:51.390 --> 04:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
these uh prohibition against these
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
weapons I wouldn't do it for those that
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
are under 18 just 18 and over um these
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
are these are weapons that can be you
 
04:45:59.868 --> 04:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
could you could possess if you're a
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
hunter you can possess if you're law
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement but the general public
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
cannot possess them
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these are Antiquated
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
weapons and a lot of people have them
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
for desktop type of uh knickknacks and
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
stuff so um I think it's time we we pass
 
04:46:16.830 --> 04:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
this repel
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative um for
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
like speak your second yes
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
so you know they talk about all their
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
weapons and what have you but they are
 
04:46:31.628 --> 04:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
less than lethal weapons so if people
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
can carry a firearm now they have an
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
option if they're somebody attacks them
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
they can fend them off with these if
 
04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
they happen to be carrying them but like
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
the you know the rep said most people
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
don't carry these anymore they're just
 
04:46:49.990 --> 04:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
knickknacks and you know history things
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
of days gone by you know I'm older than
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
dirt so I kind of remember them figed i'
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
beat that I've heard that one
 
04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
before thank you uh representative
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
I'm reading directly from the
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
constitution of the State of New
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire article 2A the bearing of arms
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
all persons have the right to keep and
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
bear arms in defense of themselves their
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
families their property and the state if
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
these items are used in a defensive
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
posture we have that right however if
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
they use it in an offensive way it's
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
already a crime so I definitely support
 
04:47:27.360 --> 04:47:28.868 align:start position:0%
already a crime so I definitely support
the

04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you um further discussion
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative wheeler on
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
the melee weapons well I was going to
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
call it the Brass Monkey I don't know
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
but is the rest of us you are now older
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
than dirt there you
 
04:47:46.830 --> 04:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
go representative Newman says that my
 
04:47:49.150 --> 04:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
brain is older than dirt so I don't know
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
I was consistent with that I support the
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
OTP on this I think it's silly to ban
 
04:48:00.070 --> 04:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
these devices these weapons when the
 
04:48:02.430 --> 04:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
police are able to use them when Hunters
 
04:48:04.510 --> 04:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
are able to use them and for the lay
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
person on the street I mean how do you
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
know if someone's got a hunting license
 
04:48:09.390 --> 04:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to carry these weapons so if
 
04:48:09.400 --> 04:48:10.548 align:start position:0%
to be able to carry these weapons so if
you're

04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
being you know I don't know if you're
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
trying to attack somebody and they pull
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
out brass knuckles how do you know that
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
that's not in violation of the section
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
they could have a hunting license it
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
could be legal so I just think you know
 
04:48:30.670 --> 04:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
we have a some of us are so adverse to
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
what could potentially come from these
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
weapons that were were against the bill
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
but I think that the you know obviously
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
no one wants to see somebody get beaten
 
04:48:42.390 --> 04:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
up by a a a brass knuckle or a slungshot
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever the third thing is I don't
 
04:48:48.350 --> 04:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
know but um fact of the matter is people
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
have a right to own these weapons and
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
you know while it's not good it's not
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
great that people get attacked people
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
have a right to defend themselves on the
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
streets and I think of a woman who you
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
know might not want to carry a gun and
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know wants to carry some brass
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
knuckles that same woman could pick up a
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
rock from the street and just as deadly
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
as the brass knuckles so if we're
 
04:49:07.628 --> 04:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about deadliness we should ban
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
rocks but we all know how silly that is
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
so I I support the OTP motion on this
 
04:49:15.548 --> 04:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah as representative man said
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
these are are essentially neck knacks
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
these days so we're just legalizing a
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
collector's item and I think that's a
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
worthwhile thing to do um you what you
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
said actually reminded me of a a
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
commercial I saw not too long ago for a
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
product for women I think it was called
 
04:49:31.548 --> 04:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
The Claw and it was um something they
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
could hold that had like a cat's claw so
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
they could if an attacker came out I
 
04:49:37.150 --> 04:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
mean it's the same kind of concept
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
somebody who's smaller and can get rid
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
of somebody who's trying to cost them as
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
they get in their car or what have you
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
um rep you do represent Manion
 
04:49:51.230 --> 04:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
see no you did have your hand up I saw
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
he was doing the ra
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.670 --> 04:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
scitec represents uh
 
04:50:02.910 --> 04:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
music yeah I I find it kind of
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
incredible that a committee that is
 
04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
charged with criminal justice and Public
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
Safety is poised to pass a bill that
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
would actually make it easier for one
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
human being to beat another human being
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
to death um I think if you if you look
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
at the kinds of injuries that these uh
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know that these that these weapons
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
cause um they're essentially a force
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
multiplier um uh the injuries that they
 
04:50:36.910 --> 04:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
cause are things like fractured orbital
 
04:50:39.868 --> 04:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
bones broken teeth they require plastic
 
04:50:43.230 --> 04:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
surgery in some cases people don't
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
recover uh when they're beaten by people
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
who are using these weapons which is one
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we currently ban them
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
under state law we don't necessarily
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
want people with these weapons in bars
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
and public gathering places we don't
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
want them in schools and the fact that
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're uh prohibiting uh selling and
 
04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
distributing them under this particular
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill to people uh age 18 and under
 
04:51:08.670 --> 04:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily keep them out of our
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
schools uh because we actually let
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
people go to 18 and over representative
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
we we actually we actually allow people
 
04:51:19.230 --> 04:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh who are 18 and over to attend our
 
04:51:19.240 --> 04:51:20.270 align:start position:0%
uh uh who are 18 and over to attend our
high

04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:51:24.548 --> 04:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
schools um so um I have been against
 
04:51:27.548 --> 04:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
this one uh in its Forum last year I
 
04:51:29.948 --> 04:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
continue to be against it uh I don't
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
think it's good public policy from a
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
public safety standpoint and I will
 
04:51:34.440 --> 04:51:35.310 align:start position:0%
public safety standpoint and I will
oppose

04:51:35.310 --> 04:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you I would um I would Hazard
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
to say that I've seen the results um of
 
04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
the damage of some of these weapons and
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
I've also seen the results of uh on a
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
woman of being forcibly raped and I
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
would um I'd Advocate the the person who
 
04:51:57.150 --> 04:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
did it get the brass knuckles before she
 
04:51:57.160 --> 04:51:58.270 align:start position:0%
did it get the brass knuckles before she
gets

04:51:58.270 --> 04:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
raped further discussion seeing none up
 
04:52:01.600 --> 04:52:02.628 align:start position:0%
raped further discussion seeing none up
representative

04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
through so that was kind of going to be
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that someone is okay leaving a
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
woman defenseless or anybody defenseless
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
to be attacked by someone
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
else is unacceptable to me
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
right I'm not just going to say yeah
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay it's okay if somebody attacks you
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
if somebody chooses to attack me I'm
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
going to defend
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
myself and if they get injured well
 
04:52:35.548 --> 04:52:35.558 align:start position:0%
that's too bad because they made the
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
decision to attack me first not that I
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
attack them first but I'm going to
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
defend myself with whatever I
 
04:52:49.470 --> 04:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
lethal not a gun so much the better that
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
person will probably
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
survive but if I my only option is a
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
firearm they probably will not
 
04:53:09.310 --> 04:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
survive so you're taking away my
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
chance to do less than lethal Force I
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that's right at
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
all I have a question um and
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative um use actually made me
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
think of
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
it would this allow a let's say a senior
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
in high school to bring these into
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
school I'd like to know
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair sure the school can make a
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
policy there are no weapons in school
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
well that's not necessarily true because
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
schools we um we we carry we can carry
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
guns to vote at a school but would it be
 
04:53:48.230 --> 04:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
different though because they're
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually school children they're a
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
student and they so they have to follow
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the school policy yeah you're voting is
 
04:53:56.548 --> 04:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
not a school voting okay I just want to
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
be clear I'm not I would not be in favor
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
of students carrying these around the
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
halls of the school
 
04:54:04.510 --> 04:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative me first in
 
04:54:06.548 --> 04:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
representative Eric G thank you a couple
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
of things so this being referred to as
 
04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
an offensive weapon is is is wrong
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a defensive weapon anything
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
can be an offensive weapon but this goes
 
04:54:18.190 --> 04:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
back to the old saying that if just
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
because it's illegal doesn't mean the
 
04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
person who wants to go out and use it as
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
an offensive weapon is going to care
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going to say oh I can't
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
carry a brass knuckle so I'll have to
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
grab a stick on the way over there
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to use it so this is all
 
04:54:32.110 --> 04:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
this is doing is preventing those people
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
women who don't who don't want to carry
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
a gun they're afraid of carrying a gun
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
but they have some sort of defense and
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
if they get if the person who attacks my
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.230 --> 04:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
it Katherine I actually agree with
 
04:54:51.070 --> 04:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
everything that um representative Muse
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
said and I do have a true concern for
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
the school because keep in mind here in
 
04:54:57.868 --> 04:54:57.878 align:start position:0%
this state 24 years old you can still be
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
in high
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
school yeah I agree um but the point was
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
made it's corly that if the school has a
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
policy then the students have to follow
 
04:55:08.190 --> 04:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
it they they wouldn't be able to get out
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
of it with
 
04:55:12.750 --> 04:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
this it's not considered a weapon when
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
you take it out it's a weapon
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
now she mentioned something it's a
 
04:55:20.390 --> 04:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
weapon it's a weapon but a gun's
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
considered a weapon I'm not talking
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
about a gun we're talking I understand
 
04:55:26.230 --> 04:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
that but that's that's legal to carry
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's a weapon so school
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's a weapon right it's
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
not a weapon it's still a weapon yeah
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
the school can say that they don't have
 
04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
they can just specific specifically say
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
no no brass knuckles no nothing you
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
can't I think they already do most of
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
them represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and I also just have to say
 
04:55:44.670 --> 04:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
this doesn't increase the prevalence of
 
04:55:46.510 --> 04:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles they're not going to be a
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
million more brass knuckles because we
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
passed this bill have all of us oh there
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we will maybe maybe we'll start
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
opening up brass knuckle shops and stuff
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
like that I don't know if that'll
 
04:56:00.030 --> 04:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
actually happen I think that's a little
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous people will sell these brass
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
knuckles and they should be allowed to
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
sell them because people have a right to
 
04:56:07.150 --> 04:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
defend themselves with these Knuckles if
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
someone gets attacked by someone with
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles representative Muse that
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
person will go to jail for an assault
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
charge I do not need you to lecture me
 
04:56:17.430 --> 04:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much well then don't do
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
it to us repres okay address the chair
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I apologize for
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
that if someone gets attacked they will
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
go to jail for an assault if they're in
 
04:56:30.270 --> 04:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
school if they're on the street if
 
04:56:32.548 --> 04:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
someone goes out and starts beating
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
people with brass Knuckles the police
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
will throw that person into prison where
 
04:56:39.150 --> 04:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
they belong but if a woman who has no
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
way to defend herself gets attacked by a
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
6'4 person on the street and has the
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles to be able to defend
 
04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and then as representative
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
Manion said that person gets laid out so
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
be it they shouldn't have attacked a
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
woman on the street and they shouldn't
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
have been attacking people and that
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
woman has a right to defend themselves
 
04:57:00.670 --> 04:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles or as I said they could
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
pick up a rock from the forest if we
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
don't make this bill
 
04:57:07.628 --> 04:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
legal very good all right um
 
04:57:07.638 --> 04:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
legal very good all right um
representative

04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
Newman I guess you don't like it I'm not
 
04:57:14.548 --> 04:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
sure that this bill does what it intends
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm just talking about the wording
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
bill it says um to repeal RSA 15916 is
 
04:57:27.110 --> 04:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
repealed and and reenacted as
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
follows uh 15916 says whoever accept is
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
provided by law and this Amendment as I
 
04:57:37.230 --> 04:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
read it says any person under under the
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
age of 18 who carries or person or
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
slungshot or mentality shall be guilty
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
of a violation and such weapon so
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
carried shall be forfeited to the state
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
does that since You' repealed it does
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
does what you've repealed it says
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
whoever does this now only apply to
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
people under 18 I'm I'm confused about
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
that I think so the language before made
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
those items illegal the language now
 
04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
would say anyone under 18 who carries
 
04:58:09.310 --> 04:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
these items it is illegal okay so I
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
think that's what that does I'll look at
 
04:58:12.670 --> 04:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
the other SE thank you very much you're
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%

motion what what this bill does is it
 
05:02:16.510 --> 05:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
essentially um uh amends New Hampshire's
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
revenge porn statute uh to include uh
 
05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
digitally generated synthetic images so
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've all been reading
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
about uh is how essentially uh uh AI is
 
05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
changing uh a lot of things uh uh the
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
ability to do things like create deep
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
fake images um is something that uh is
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
harming not only celebrities uh but it's
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
harming uh people's daughters it's
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
harming 24 year olds who try to get a
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
job and find out that there's a deep
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
fake image of them on uh on PornHub uh
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
that their uh potential new employer is
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
actually finding when they do a Google
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
search of them um the bottom line is
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
that we make um the
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
the the non-consensual
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
dissemination of um these types of
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
images when they're photographs a class
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
B felony in New Hampshire um and the act
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
of taking some the the face of an
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
innocent person and pasting them over um
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
the body of another person doing
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
something that that the the person who
 
05:03:30.548 --> 05:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
owns the face um uh wasn't a party of
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
and didn't do I I think is um
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's reprehensible uh and we have a lot
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
of work I think to do as a legislature
 
05:03:42.910 --> 05:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out things like like AI
 
05:03:45.548 --> 05:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
um and try to figure out you know what
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
are some of the ways that we can you
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
know in a common sense kind of way you
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
know begin to to protect people more uh
 
05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire than they currently are
 
05:03:58.350 --> 05:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think that there will be some
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
work that's happening at the at the
 
05:04:01.868 --> 05:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
national level at least I hope there's
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
some work that actually emerges from
 
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
Congress because I know people in both
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
parties are concerned about this um but
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is this is one small thing
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we could do uh here in New
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would uh that would
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
actually uh address a situation that
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're already starting to see and and we
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually heard testimony uh from the
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
state police that this is something that
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes we already are starting to see this
 
05:04:27.470 --> 05:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
in our
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
state thank you um would you like to
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your second represent wheeler
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes please Mr chairman really quickly um
 
05:04:37.470 --> 05:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
just as a young person who is on the
 
05:04:40.350 --> 05:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
internet a decent amount and sees this
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very it's concerning I mean the
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
rise and prevalence of AI and revenge
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
porn and fake synthetic images that are
 
05:04:50.670 --> 05:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
being created
 
05:04:53.788 --> 05:04:53.798 align:start position:0%
to I mean do horrible things to people I
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
mean and if you're a celebrity then you
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
have the wealth the status the power to
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
be able to you know solve that issue in
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
whatever way would be you could solve it
 
05:05:07.470 --> 05:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
um prosecutorial or whatever but if
 
05:05:09.788 --> 05:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
you're a regular person on the ground
 
05:05:12.548 --> 05:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
you have no recourse to be able to get
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
somebody addressed with this and that
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
person can just keep making these images
 
05:05:19.470 --> 05:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
and well you can't do anything about it
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
well now we can't class B felony and I
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good thing and I
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative abuse for
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward I I agree
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Muse and I
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
have both been the victim of that
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
recently together I don't I don't think
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
it's been pornh Hub yet but it's it's it
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
has uh it has made the Browns um don't
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
yeah um further
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative um Lynn you
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
know I just just to I just raise an
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
issue um we have in judiciary and fact
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably execute in on
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
March 6th um of of what I think is a
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
very similar Bill dealing with um um
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
artificial de dealing with deep fakes
 
05:06:03.628 --> 05:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
and basically our bill would make
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
it makes a creates a felony to have it
 
05:06:08.430 --> 05:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know to to use a deep fake it
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
creates a cause of action for that and
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
it also has a provision uh uh
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
prohibiting its use in in political uh
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know unless there's unless there's a
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
a disclosure of some kind so I'm just I
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
I I you know I don't I haven't looked at
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
your bill so I don't know whether your
 
05:06:28.990 --> 05:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill may be better than our bill I'm
 
05:06:30.548 --> 05:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
just saying I just wanted to let the
 
05:06:32.548 --> 05:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
committee know that there is another and
 
05:06:34.350 --> 05:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I suppose it's possible some other
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee might have you know Commerce
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
or something I don't know but just let
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know we we do have F I know there
 
05:06:41.430 --> 05:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
are five different bills that are
 
05:06:42.990 --> 05:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with this in in one way or
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
another um we actually have another bill
 
05:06:46.190 --> 05:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to be executing
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
later today that that also kind of gets
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
into this
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
territory as I looked at it and the
 
05:06:53.868 --> 05:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
reason why I decided to focus narrowly
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
on this is is I think that um to me this
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
seems to be a pretty open and shut
 
05:07:01.868 --> 05:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
extension of our of our current law it
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be something we can get our
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
teeth around now with some of the other
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
things there are there are First
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment issues that are involved there
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of complexities with
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
trying to regulate this in the right way
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh so this just struck me as
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
something that we could do and and get
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
started with yeah I'd rather I'd rather
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'd rather pass them and let's sort it
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
out at the floor which one's best um
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
rather than have them all everyone
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
assume that someone else is doing it um
 
05:07:33.788 --> 05:07:33.798 align:start position:0%
but we will will be actually um probably
 
05:07:35.230 --> 05:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
deferring to you in a couple minutes on
 
05:07:36.670 --> 05:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that we are going to
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
address so
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
um um well now we're going to have
 
05:07:43.548 --> 05:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
further discussion um representative PR
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
because I think you want to stay longer
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
um now what what um so the the motion
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
before us now is to adopt the amendment
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
or did we do that we did that U motion's
 
05:07:55.948 --> 05:07:55.958 align:start position:0%
ought to pass that ask cler callor

motion Mr chairman I move
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
OTP is there second by representative um
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
who second did oh roads did would you
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh little story I used to
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
work for a federal agency that
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
um requires you not to have a firearm on
 
05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
the premises and locked my firearm in
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
the car and parked off premises uh so it
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
could be able to go hunting after work I
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
work third shift for this agency um I
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
think that if we've extended the castle
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
doctrine to our homes and our cars uh
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
that our cars are pretty sanct toan
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
so uh the sanctity of that car um you
 
05:09:37.510 --> 05:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to keep a firearm there
 
05:09:40.670 --> 05:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
as long as it's locked and secure from
 
05:09:43.868 --> 05:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
outside pilage I I believe that it's it
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
definitely is something that should be
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
allowed in the
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
state AB BR like to speak to a second
 
05:09:52.548 --> 05:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
um you know basically the what
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
represented Jen said is what I would say
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
I would just add that there is some
 
05:10:01.628 --> 05:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
debate and some question about well what
 
05:10:03.548 --> 05:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
if somebody breaks into your car well
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
now you're a thief um and that's illegal
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
to break into my car and
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
um you know if I'm respecting the wish
 
05:10:14.548 --> 05:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
of said business and not taking a
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
firearm in which they wouldn't know but
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
if I did respect that and I left it in
 
05:10:21.788 --> 05:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
my car um I I feel like I've at least
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
made a happy compromise I've was able to
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
keep myself
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
protected wherever it was I was going
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
and then respected the wishes of said
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
business and didn't carry my take my
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
firearm in um and with that you don't
 
05:10:35.948 --> 05:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
want to find a gun in my car don't break
 
05:10:35.958 --> 05:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
want to find a gun in my car don't break
into

05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you um I this is what I would
 
05:10:45.548 --> 05:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
say we have extended to businesses and
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
frankly people the right to say um you
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
know I respect your second amendment
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
rights but not in here um restaurants
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
are free to say you can't come in bars
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
are free to say you can't come in um and
 
05:11:02.430 --> 05:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
if you do that you can be um rescu for
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
trespassing I believe so if businesses
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
your employer says you know what your
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
rights are your rights but not in our
 
05:11:12.150 --> 05:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
business we respect that um but at the
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
same time we do not want to disarm
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
people of their of their second
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendment rights for the remainder of
 
05:11:21.310 --> 05:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
their trip remainder of their day many
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
people work late and they have a long
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
commute home their car breaks down the
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
side of the road there near no firearm
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
we every day in the news we see stories
 
05:11:31.470 --> 05:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
of someone found somewhere who
 
05:11:31.480 --> 05:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
of someone found somewhere who
disappeared

05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
05:11:34.830 --> 05:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want that in New
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um Firearms we have a specific
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
crime of Lara firearm I believe which is
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
a felony um so if someone breaks it's
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
not the same as breaking into your car
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
and stealing your your Kenwood in your
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
bazooka base tube um it's stealing a a
 
05:11:54.510 --> 05:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
felony is stealing a firearm so I
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
believe we've covered that in the law so
 
05:11:59.548 --> 05:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's all I have to say
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
in that further discussion
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
um M representative Jan Ren I just
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to um ask you said that castle
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
doctrine does include your car it does
 
05:12:15.788 --> 05:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you because I just I feel
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
like my biggest concern with this is
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
just we're getting into a gray area of
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
property rights and personal rights and
 
05:12:23.788 --> 05:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that makes it
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
OTP represent Muse
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
what the castle doctrine doesn't include
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
is your car when you drive it onto
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
somebody else's
 
05:12:40.350 --> 05:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
property um I I think that's something
 
05:12:42.990 --> 05:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to focus on a little bit
 
05:12:47.470 --> 05:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
here um I know my employer for almost 30
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
years uh had me uh sign a non-compete
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
agreement I had to sign multiple
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements over the years
 
05:12:58.590 --> 05:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
there are a whole bunch of things that
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
over the years I was asked to do that
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
interfered with my rights and I did and
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
I agreed to those things because they
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
were a condition of
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
employment um we just had a bill you
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
know where we talked about um uh you
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
know a school being able to set a policy
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know to uh exclude brass knuckles if
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
we had a problem with brass knuckles in
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
schools um here we have a situation
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
where an employer you know for instance
 
05:13:30.910 --> 05:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
a daycare center um and I raised this
 
05:13:34.230 --> 05:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing ing uh a child
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
care center uh you could have somebody
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
who yes uh has a weapon in the car and
 
05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
19 out of 20 times they remember to lock
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
the door but this one day their phone
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
went off they got a message and for one
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
reason or another they didn't lock the
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
car um if that car happens to be parked
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
near the kids playground there's a
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
chance that kids might try the door and
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
get in the car and you know the the the
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is this is yet another
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill that's in search for a problem um
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
that I don't think exists I think the
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
vast majority of gun owners who run into
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
a situation where for instance they want
 
05:14:14.190 --> 05:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
to go shooting after work they're just
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to put the gun in their in the
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
trunk of their car anyway they're going
 
05:14:19.390 --> 05:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
to stuff it under the seat or put it in
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
the glove compartment um I don't think
 
05:14:24.430 --> 05:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's a law that we can pass that's
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to change that one way or the
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
other but I I am very concerned with the
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
kind of message that this that this
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
sends um and I'm also concerned with the
 
05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
fact that you know here we are once
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
again flip-flopping on the issue of the
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
rights of property owners and you know
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
it just seems we kind of go back and
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
forth depending on which way it it seems
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
to suit us um so that that's essentially
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
the problem that I have with the
 
05:14:56.110 --> 05:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you represent Manion thank
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um the difference I see
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
here is when you sign non-disclosure
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
agreements or any other kind of
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
agreements with your employer while
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
you're in the
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
building I'm going to guess that none of
 
05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
those infringe on your constitutional
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
rights other than this and they're and
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're infringing on your
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights when you're off
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
property traveling to and from so I
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
think that might be the difference in
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
this Poss representative um represent M
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
did you want to um address that to the
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair yeah there there is a an issue of
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know of of free speech as well um
 
05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
there also you know is an ongoing issue
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
with things like you know in New
 
05:15:42.430 --> 05:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other states with
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
non-compete agreements which arct which
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
restrict can restrict your ability to
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
move and to you know to earn an income
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
so there are you know and these are
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
these are ESS essentially things that
 
05:15:54.548 --> 05:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
we've kind of agreed to in the law to
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
allow employers to do their business and
 
05:15:58.350 --> 05:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they can and I
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
worked in HR for an awful long time and
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they they can do
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
is basically hand you a code of conduct
 
05:16:09.868 --> 05:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
or or essentially a rule book and and
 
05:16:11.788 --> 05:16:11.798 align:start position:0%
essentially have you sign a document
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
that basically says you will act in
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
accordance with these policies and if
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
you do not in act in accordance with
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
cause represent
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Pro well the difference between a
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure in the first first
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
amendment in this is my life is not in
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
jeopardy when I can't say something but
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
if I can't bring my protection with
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
me to and from
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
work and I get I stop at the store and
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
somebody tries to rob me and ends up and
 
05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
I have no defense because I couldn't
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
bring it to work that's the
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
difference right and if it stays locked
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
in my
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
car it's not affecting me at
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
work represent Manion thank you Mr chair
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh as far as our first amendment is
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerned um that's infringement from
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the government not your employer so
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different when I'm off
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
property My Second Amendment right to
 
05:17:20.190 --> 05:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
carry has now been taken away by the
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
business but if they ask you not to
 
05:17:23.548 --> 05:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
speak about something that's not the
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
government telling you to do that so
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply the First Amendment
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
that what you mean is the First
 
05:17:32.708 --> 05:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment restricts the government from
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
Banning your speech not your employer
 
05:17:36.270 --> 05:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
your employer is free to ban whatever it
 
05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
wants and you're free to seek other
 
05:17:40.070 --> 05:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
employment should you so desire um
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler then
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative Balden thank you Mr
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker CH Mr chairman um I was told
 
05:17:51.430 --> 05:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
mistruths about this in caucus I'll be
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
voting the way I said I was going to
 
05:17:55.548 --> 05:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
vote in caucus but we'll probably change
 
05:17:58.270 --> 05:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
my vote on the floor that's all I I have
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
no idea what you mean but okay
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Balden
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
have we covered how this affects when
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government is an
 
05:18:10.270 --> 05:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
employer because um you can't have guns
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
on like Postal Service property they
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
have a yeah that's changed I think right
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
but no one yeah Cas law you thought you
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
were on top of it but you're not no I
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't well I'll be Googling this and
 
05:18:28.590 --> 05:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
raising my hand again as needed no no no
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
um I to to answer that question real
 
05:18:30.958 --> 05:18:32.190 align:start position:0%
um I to to answer that question real
quick

05:18:32.190 --> 05:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
quick
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
this would have zero effect on postal
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
property or federal if you're federal
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
government your employer the federal
 
05:18:39.788 --> 05:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
rules uh we cannot tell the federal
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
government they can't fire you because
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
you violated that um we we would um the
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
preemption um would stop that I believe
 
05:18:51.070 --> 05:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
but isn't it doesn't it come become
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
pretty muddy at that point where maybe
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
someone hears about this if it passes
 
05:18:58.750 --> 05:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
into law and is inv vetoed and then they
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't understand the the menu shed I
 
05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
mean that's really complex ignorance of
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
the law is not a defense I know but
 
05:19:08.350 --> 05:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying is are we setting
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
people up for a problem here I
 
05:19:12.670 --> 05:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
personally will um put it on my my
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
Facebook page um representative sake
 
05:19:18.750 --> 05:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh not surprisingly I don't
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
really support this law but um the
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
bigger issue that I see is the
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
enforceability or lack of
 
05:19:29.310 --> 05:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
enforceability um who's who's monitoring
 
05:19:29.320 --> 05:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
enforceability um who's who's monitoring
who's

05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
who's
 
05:19:33.190 --> 05:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
checking and so I just don't support it
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't see it as explain what
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
you mean please monitor who's monitoring
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
who's checking to make sure cars are
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
locked in the parking lot is the
 
05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
employer doing that to make sure that if
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
you are someone they know is likely to
 
05:19:45.868 --> 05:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
be carrying a gun they're going out to
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
check that your car is locked or not
 
05:19:50.590 --> 05:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
like it just it gets to me there's too
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
many complications for me to feel
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it okay I I believe
 
05:19:56.110 --> 05:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
though it exempts the employer from
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
liability um so they wouldn't feel the
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
need unless they were paranoid to check
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
your car
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I think we've pretty much dealt with
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
this one um the motion on the floor is
 
05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um and I would ask clerk
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.548 --> 05:20:17.558 align:start position:0%

let it go to the floor with no
 
05:21:13.868 --> 05:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation I don't think we have to
 
05:21:16.750 --> 05:21:16.760 align:start position:0%

help me out with this I would gladly
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
take it I do not
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken I don't think that
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
this sponsor showed up to introduce the
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't know that any of us
 
05:22:39.788 --> 05:22:39.798 align:start position:0%
really remember exactly what it was
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
about um but my understanding is that it
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
is very much illegal to try to solicit
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
minors for sexual activity so other than
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
other than that I really don't know too
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
much about what this bill did so like I
 
05:22:58.590 --> 05:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
said I'm happy to take any help I can
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
get it representative Murray would you
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak to a second
 
05:23:03.628 --> 05:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah I would
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate What U Vice chair Road said um
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was unable to come in and um
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill none of the
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors attended and the only
 
05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
testimony came from an officer who was
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the room when we questioned them
 
05:23:19.750 --> 05:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
about possible implications of passing
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
this um it seems like everything that is
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
trying to outlaw is already outlawed and
 
05:23:26.708 --> 05:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
um it's not clear why this is
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
needed um I I would say this I think it
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
is a great disrespect to the members of
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
this Committee in our time to submit a
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill not show up for to introduce the
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
bill and that's okay I think it's
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
happened I haven't got an email from
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
anyone I don't know if anyone else did
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
represent Wheeler's indicating he may
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
have well we did as a it was within a
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
bunch of emails but um representative
 
05:23:50.788 --> 05:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
Perez the Republican representative
 
05:23:53.190 --> 05:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
Perez did send an email to the committee
 
05:23:54.910 --> 05:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
apologizing initially and then sent an
 
05:23:56.830 --> 05:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
email a couple of days ago apologizing
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
that she wouldn't be able to be here for
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
that I can for that to you that's okay
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well all right
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to send an email back
 
05:24:07.230 --> 05:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
saying I apologize I'm not able to pass
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
your bill um I I don't I just don't
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand it um so um if it was
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
important I would I would think that
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
somebody there were co-sponsors on the
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill and anyway I'm I'm wasting more
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
time anyone else want to discuss
 
05:24:24.430 --> 05:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
represent Manion thank you Mr chair yeah
 
05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
I agree that this is already in law so
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's no real reason to pass it and I
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative muray for
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
always having the history on this stuff
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
because I can't remember any of it
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
didto okay with that um I'll ask the

please thank you Mr chairman um I move

would you like to speak to your motion
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative rhods sure thank you Mr
 
05:25:54.910 --> 05:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um so we've heard some some
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
conversation about Ai
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
and without talking about other
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislation I have to for a second and
 
05:26:05.948 --> 05:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
let it be known that representative Lynn
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
who will probably wish he did not come
 
05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
today um actually did mention what he
 
05:26:13.510 --> 05:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that there was a a
 
05:26:14.910 --> 05:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
pretty in-depth bill over in the
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and it was basically
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussed that instead of us trying to
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
piece together different pieces of
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to make something happen it
 
05:26:26.390 --> 05:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
might be a better idea
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
to inim study this he can look at the
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have the legislation
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
that he has and hopefully come up with a
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know some good legislation around
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
the the concerns a lot of people are
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
seeming to
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
have thank you represent whey would you
 
05:26:41.708 --> 05:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second uh yes
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
please Mr chairman thank you I
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this legislation alongside
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative Linda massima um you know
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons I articulated in
 
05:26:53.948 --> 05:26:53.958 align:start position:0%
1319 very concerned with just the
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
prevalence of AI in general um and this
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
is more broadly the unlawful
 
05:27:02.110 --> 05:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
distribution of uh misleading synthetic
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
media um I mean they're going to create
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
whole new realities with what they can
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
do now it's not just Photoshop or you
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
can tell kind of you know the wave looks
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
a little off so it's clearly
 
05:27:15.230 --> 05:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
photoshopped no this is hyper realistic
 
05:27:18.590 --> 05:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
AI generated imagery and videos that can
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
I mean for the lay person not even
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
unintelligent people but the lay person
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
will see that and be bought into the
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
narrative and then come up with a whole
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
opinion on something that is just
 
05:27:35.230 --> 05:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
completely false and I I think we saw
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
that um the worries of that with what
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the primary election with a
 
05:27:42.628 --> 05:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
robo call of you know a fake AI
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
President Biden come on Jack you know he
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
had thrown out a call and people were
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
convinced by that that's really
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
concerning you know we're talking about
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
these Robo calls and all this other
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
stuff so I would support interim study I
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately would hope and I know that
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
you had asked the speaker for this that
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
there would be some sort sort of
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
commission or something like that that
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state government could look at so
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we could come with just the general
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
topic of AI and how the state government
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
could approach that in a way that would
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
be meaningful and actually address
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
something for the uh constituents here
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
in the state who would be misled by the
 
05:28:20.590 --> 05:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
prevalence of this new technology
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
creating a new paradigm in in our world
 
05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that that's actually one of my
 
05:28:28.350 --> 05:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
summer projects to um to look at um I
 
05:28:30.548 --> 05:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
think that for too long we are playing
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
catch up with technology by legislating
 
05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
after things are already out and I think
 
05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we're concerned about images
 
05:28:41.708 --> 05:28:41.718 align:start position:0%
and phone calls I'm concerned about you
 
05:28:44.590 --> 05:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
know we've almost had War start already
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
over pictures that were not real so I
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
think that we really got to get a hold
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
of this um having said that
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative um Lynn does have a
 
05:28:56.910 --> 05:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive bill um we passed one bill
 
05:28:59.590 --> 05:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
earlier now they have that one plus I
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's a few others I think we
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
have enough AI subject matter there to
 
05:29:07.788 --> 05:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
work with so I go I agree with interm
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
study represent breed thank you Mr
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
chairman I I agree with the interm study
 
05:29:14.350 --> 05:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
um and that something definitely needs
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
to be done my only concern with this
 
05:29:18.670 --> 05:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill was that who's going to be there
 
05:29:22.270 --> 05:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
was a heavy focus on on political um you
 
05:29:25.510 --> 05:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
know uh points and my con my concern
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
with this is who's going to be the
 
05:29:29.548 --> 05:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
designated Arbiter of Truth and will
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
this be used as a form of
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
censorship um if you know I think we
 
05:29:36.510 --> 05:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
need to put guard rails in place um to
 
05:29:39.150 --> 05:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the truth is the truth and
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
not one group has um say over what is
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
their definition of truth that is my
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
concern thank you yeah I agree that's um
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
in any type of thing like that you have
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
to at the end of the day wonder who's
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
who's checking the true Checker
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
05:30:01.548 --> 05:30:01.558 align:start position:0%
well while I think I could benefit from
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of AI myself um I agree
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
with both representative wheeler and
 
05:30:05.920 --> 05:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
with both representative wheeler and
representative

05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
Reed represent
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
um in looking at my notes for this bill
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed there's I wrote down a few
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
notes one is that there was no intent as
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
an element of the crime um there was no
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
mention of social media companies being
 
05:30:31.868 --> 05:30:31.878 align:start position:0%
liable for distribution ution um it
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
seemed to be slanted to regulate speech
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
for elections mostly um and I will note
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
that the Federal Communications
 
05:30:40.510 --> 05:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
Commission and the Federal Election
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
Commission have already taken up this
 
05:30:44.948 --> 05:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
subject I think it might be useful and
 
05:30:48.030 --> 05:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
under interim study for whoever works on
 
05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
that to look at what the Federal
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
Election Commission and FCC have come up
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
with for their regulations so that we
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
can probably CAU a fir in our
 
05:31:00.270 --> 05:31:00.280 align:start position:0%

05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%

double check for yourselves if you'd
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
like um and then it makes um basically
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
it just ma matches their internal
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
documents and then their forms that they
 
05:37:35.470 --> 05:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
use um when uh documenting an encounter
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
at the border doesn't add anything
 
05:37:40.708 --> 05:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
additional um it just ensures that the
 
05:37:43.708 --> 05:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
information that they collect is sent to
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker the Senate President and
 
05:37:46.080 --> 05:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker the Senate President and
the

05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:50.350 --> 05:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
governor thank you um who seconded that
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative s would you like to speak
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
to your second yes thank you I I just
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
want to say I think the importance of
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
having data that we can all easily
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
access so that we can make the best
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
decisions for all our constituents is
 
05:38:06.390 --> 05:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
really important and this is just a bill
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
asking for data to be provided in a way
 
05:38:12.510 --> 05:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
that we can easily access it thank you
 
05:38:16.270 --> 05:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I tend to uh support in the bill
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
because it it isn't asking for new
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
information it isn't asking for the
 
05:38:22.110 --> 05:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
police to make opinions it isn't asking
 
05:38:23.548 --> 05:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
them to do anything other than they
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
already doing and to get the data um
 
05:38:29.310 --> 05:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
over to the people that we'd like to
 
05:38:31.590 --> 05:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
have have eyes on it so I I think it's
 
05:38:34.910 --> 05:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
fine um further discussion
 
05:38:34.920 --> 05:38:37.270 align:start position:0%
fine um further discussion
representative

05:38:37.270 --> 05:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
zitech um I'm not happy with the state
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
police policy because it says race who
 
05:38:44.110 --> 05:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
determines race is it self-identified is
 
05:38:47.708 --> 05:38:47.718 align:start position:0%
it determined by the uh Trooper uh maybe
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
there's an answer to that and I'll
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
listen to it but I don't like race
 
05:38:53.310 --> 05:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
period I'd like country of origin
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
because what's I don't race I'm just not
 
05:39:00.990 --> 05:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
I want country of origin
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is um information that they correct
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
when they make an arrest just to be
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
clear that yeah so um representative
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
Murray did you have your hand raised I
 
05:39:12.468 --> 05:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that I I did I was
 
05:39:14.190 --> 05:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
originally considering adding in country
 
05:39:15.788 --> 05:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
of origin but because that doesn't match
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
up with what they're currently doing I
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that um we weren't
 
05:39:21.948 --> 05:39:21.958 align:start position:0%
asking them to change all these forms
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
and their current methods for tracking
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
um the data of
 
05:39:29.990 --> 05:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
encounters um for race
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find um maybe just give me
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
a second but I do have a copy of the
 
05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
forms they use and I can check and see
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
if that's something that they um assume
 
05:39:41.190 --> 05:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
or ask people to
 
05:39:43.868 --> 05:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
self-identify okay yeah I don't know how
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
I how they do that when they it's this
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
is an arrest form you're talking about
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah represented man you
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
can speak so unless I'm wrong here but
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
if if it's an arrest or something when
 
05:39:56.190 --> 05:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's in custody and they don't
 
05:39:58.590 --> 05:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
they self-identify I would never guess
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
it would be unknown if I don't know so
 
05:40:00.990 --> 05:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
it would just come up as unknown and
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
that data would be just what it is y
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
discussion all right um with that the
 
05:40:14.430 --> 05:40:14.440 align:start position:0%

06:02:32.190 --> 06:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
people getting their suspension and then
 
06:02:33.670 --> 06:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
serving it out when it wasn't boating
 
06:02:36.750 --> 06:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
season anyway um so what this all this
 
06:02:38.948 --> 06:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
does is it changes the time period the
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
really the key sentence is the last one
 
06:02:42.190 --> 06:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
it says the period for the loss of the
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
person's privilege to operate a boat
 
06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
shall be between Memorial Day and Labor
 
06:02:48.270 --> 06:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
Day so that means if you get your right
 
06:02:50.190 --> 06:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
to sus operate a boat suspended because
 
06:02:51.468 --> 06:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
you were operating Reckless and
 
06:02:53.670 --> 06:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
dangerously it's actually going to hurt
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
you because you can't operate the boat
 
06:02:56.750 --> 06:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
when you would be normally operating a
 
06:02:58.788 --> 06:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
boat versus being able to sit around all
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
winter and say haha I got suspended but
 
06:03:04.510 --> 06:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
questions seconded um by who seconded
 
06:03:08.830 --> 06:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
that represent PR do you want to speak
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
second it packs the punch
 
06:03:22.468 --> 06:03:22.478 align:start position:0%
when they would be most hurt by it
 
06:03:25.708 --> 06:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
during the summer so yep thank you any
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:03:30.350 --> 06:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
wheeler I just have a question Mr
 
06:03:33.468 --> 06:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
chairman um and this might be because I
 
06:03:34.990 --> 06:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
don't for some reason I'm missing the
 
06:03:41.030 --> 06:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
notes from 118 but uh what was it before
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
the labor Memorial Day to Labor
 
06:03:46.590 --> 06:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
Day it was um from the point of when the
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
court suspended the license to or what
 
06:03:51.310 --> 06:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
you so you could have it in the win
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly if you went to court Labor Day
 
06:03:54.948 --> 06:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
yeah if you went to court in October for
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
something you did July your license is
 
06:04:00.510 --> 06:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
now suspended for 60 days wer yeah no so
 
06:04:00.520 --> 06:04:02.670 align:start position:0%
now suspended for 60 days wer yeah no so
we've

06:04:02.670 --> 06:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
we've
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
this difference I
 
06:04:10.430 --> 06:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
wrote you the holiday yeah the holidays
 
06:04:11.948 --> 06:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
because those are the generally the days
 
06:04:14.190 --> 06:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
people vote um you you take your boat
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
out um mostly on uh Memorial Day and
 
06:04:20.030 --> 06:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
most people put their boats up Labor Day
 
06:04:23.150 --> 06:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't yeah I don't have one so yeah
 
06:04:27.230 --> 06:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I actually the they would I had a i
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
used to have a bass boat and what they
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
say is um the what is it the the
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
happiest and worst day of your life the
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
you get um they're very expensive uh to
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
maintain and in any event um any further
 
06:04:41.830 --> 06:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill representative
 
06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
sing thank you um I I really support
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
this and I support the mod modifying the
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
timeline to being during the primary
 
06:04:51.868 --> 06:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
summer months um as someone who has
 
06:04:55.788 --> 06:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
nearly been run off the water uh on um
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
winaki on more than one
 
06:04:59.788 --> 06:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
and wishing that those people didn't
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
still be able to drive till they learned
 
06:05:03.070 --> 06:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
how to do it properly I very much
 
06:05:05.190 --> 06:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you um
 
06:05:08.788 --> 06:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I'm just
 
06:05:11.548 --> 06:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
C I'm just curious about the the last
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
sentence it says any the unserved
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
suspension will be continued to the
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
following voting season yeah does does
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
does that take it back to the between Li
 
06:05:24.510 --> 06:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
day yes um that would so in other words
 
06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
if you got your boat your license
 
06:05:29.070 --> 06:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
suspended in July and what you didn't
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
get the full 60 days in whatever was
 
06:05:32.590 --> 06:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
left would carry over to the next after
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day right but I just didn't
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
know I just didn't know if it took it
 
06:05:37.468 --> 06:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
back to between Le day and may I mean
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's different wording than the original
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
penalty I I think that I'm not sure just
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
wondering thank you no no it's a good
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
question I think that since we
 
06:05:47.510 --> 06:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
delineated it by saying Memorial Day and
 
06:05:48.910 --> 06:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
Labor Day it's clear that that's the
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
boting season the court will look at and
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
say representative Lynn would you agree
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
that to that I do I think I agree okay
 
06:05:59.230 --> 06:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative scitec are

that I make a motion of V to pass with
 
06:07:06.670 --> 06:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment um second somebody please
 
06:07:10.270 --> 06:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely second by representative appr
 
06:07:13.948 --> 06:07:13.958 align:start position:0%
um that the bill is open to discussion
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to discuss representative
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
scitec does anybody remember why Hines
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
reduced this to a violation it sure
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
seems like it's a Mis misdemeanor class
 
06:07:24.468 --> 06:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
to me
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
but um I believe the amendment says
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I believe I believe the
 
06:07:34.750 --> 06:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
rationale was he didn't want it to
 
06:07:37.708 --> 06:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
create a criminal record yeah but I
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
believe we took that back to a
 
06:07:40.990 --> 06:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor correct with the
 
06:07:41.000 --> 06:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor correct with the
amendment

06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:07:46.350 --> 06:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it it looks like we took it
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:53.350 --> 06:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor let's see let's make
 
06:07:53.360 --> 06:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor let's see let's make
sure

06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:07:55.840 --> 06:07:58.590 align:start position:0%
sure
section

06:07:58.590 --> 06:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:07:58.600 --> 06:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
section
penalty

06:08:04.230 --> 06:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
this there are two sections the first
 
06:08:31.390 --> 06:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
section of the that was the amendment
 
06:08:34.310 --> 06:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
the SEC which you've changed but the
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
first uh say in a careless and negligent
 
06:08:39.070 --> 06:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
manner said that the lives and safety of
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
the public are endangered it's a
 
06:08:41.520 --> 06:08:43.190 align:start position:0%
the public are endangered it's a
violation

06:08:43.190 --> 06:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
violation
 
06:08:46.350 --> 06:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not happy with that actually Mr
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
chairman I remember when we were hearing
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that he presently it's a
 
06:08:54.548 --> 06:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor yeah and he's and he wanted
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
to make the careless and negligent
 
06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
operation of ation but Reckless
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and does this accomplish
 
06:09:06.670 --> 06:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
that it does okay so we don't have a
 
06:09:08.990 --> 06:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
conflict I'm looking at the bill but the
 
06:09:10.468 --> 06:09:10.478 align:start position:0%
what really matters is the actual
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
statute um because the bill just amends
 
06:09:16.468 --> 06:09:16.478 align:start position:0%
the statute so the operation
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
of Freez by injury absence remov from
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
Place rival scene any person oper vessel
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
that is a man involved in accident shall
 
06:09:27.390 --> 06:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
report if the operator is physically
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
mentally capable to make such a report
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
or fails or refuses to make the report
 
06:09:33.070 --> 06:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
provided required information the owner
 
06:09:34.750 --> 06:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
of the vessel involved in accident of
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
the owner's representative shall after
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
learning the accident
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
for so where's where's the say
 
06:09:43.990 --> 06:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I mean
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
violation think she has something can I
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
just CL pleas because so what he was
 
06:09:50.590 --> 06:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
doing was he was amending the negligent
 
06:09:52.110 --> 06:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
one in the first place and then he was
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
adding another section that that
 
06:09:57.150 --> 06:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
differentiates between um between Ence
 
06:09:58.670 --> 06:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
and Reckless operation of both so that's
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
why the second one is a misdemeanor so
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
that it's saying it's differentiating
 
06:10:04.270 --> 06:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
between I got you the two okay it makes
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
sense then yes good I represent scitech
 
06:10:09.310 --> 06:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I was just careless and
 
06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
negligent and Reckless were the same in
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
my mind that the problem okay so we're
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
all clear all right thank you thank you
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
for pointing it out though I don't want
 
06:10:19.030 --> 06:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
to pass something that conflicts any
 
06:10:19.040 --> 06:10:20.310 align:start position:0%
to pass something that conflicts any
further

06:10:20.310 --> 06:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:10:24.030 --> 06:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lynn
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I I don't I don't wish to be a
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
nitpicker but I think that you do you
 
06:10:32.548 --> 06:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
may have a problem in the in the in
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
section one it says any person who shall
 
06:10:37.270 --> 06:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
operate a power boat upon any Waters of
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
the state in a careless or negligent
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
manner that's fine because that's
 
06:10:41.788 --> 06:10:41.798 align:start position:0%
different than two which talks about a
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
reckless manner but then the second
 
06:10:47.230 --> 06:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
phrase in one is or so that the lives
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
and safety of the public are endangered
 
06:10:52.990 --> 06:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
and that is so that is the same as the
 
06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
second phrase of two or so the lives of
 
06:10:57.430 --> 06:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
of sa and safy of the public are
 
06:11:00.788 --> 06:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
endangered so since you have an or there
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
on both of them I think you've
 
06:11:07.070 --> 06:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
got you know you've got I mean the same
 
06:11:09.468 --> 06:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
conduct could violate both s and I I
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
mean I suppose that means you could just
 
06:11:12.868 --> 06:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
give it prosecutorial discretion the
 
06:11:14.430 --> 06:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutor could charge under either one
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
I suppose well do isn't it
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
differentiated though by one is
 
06:11:19.390 --> 06:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
negligent and one is reckless yeah
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
except that the or would say in other
 
06:11:25.150 --> 06:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
words in a reckless manner that's one
 
06:11:29.948 --> 06:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
thing or so that you know that's that's
 
06:11:32.590 --> 06:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
the thing I see as a as a potential
 
06:11:32.600 --> 06:11:35.948 align:start position:0%
the thing I see as a as a potential
problem

06:11:35.948 --> 06:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.830 --> 06:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean I supp as I said I suppose you
 
06:11:41.830 --> 06:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
could you know you could say that the
 
06:11:44.110 --> 06:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has the discretion to charge
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:51.310 --> 06:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
one if it's as long as it doesn't
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
conflict if if it leaves prosecut
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor yeah I suppose all right I
 
06:11:59.070 --> 06:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
suppose that's all right represent I was
 
06:12:00.548 --> 06:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
just going to say I apologize because I
 
06:12:01.948 --> 06:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't seem to write the guy's
 
06:12:03.468 --> 06:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
name down but we did have somebody who
 
06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
came and spoke about um what does
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
anybody remember who it was who yeah
 
06:12:10.590 --> 06:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
Captain SL and and he was talking about
 
06:12:12.910 --> 06:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
um why these why the differentiation was
 
06:12:15.230 --> 06:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
important and why it was because it's
 
06:12:16.510 --> 06:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
about you know if you're intentionally
 
06:12:18.030 --> 06:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
doing something or if you're if you're
 
06:12:22.270 --> 06:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
doing something with unintentionally
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it was yeah Captain
 
06:12:28.910 --> 06:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
walls yeah it was C Dy he's actually
 
06:12:31.350 --> 06:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
retired from the Marine Patrol but he's
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative spokesman for them good
 
06:12:36.190 --> 06:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
okay so do you know I
 
06:12:38.990 --> 06:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
mean the way you could solve this is
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
just take the word or out of both of
 
06:12:42.990 --> 06:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
them take the word in other words
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
operates in a in a negligent manner so
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the lives and safety and then the
 
06:12:49.868 --> 06:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
second one would be operates in a in a
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
reckless manner so that the lives and
 
06:12:54.670 --> 06:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
safety that I think that I think that
 
06:12:56.670 --> 06:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
probably makes it clearer but it's not
 
06:12:59.390 --> 06:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not as I say I'm I'm going
 
06:13:01.548 --> 06:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
to vote for this I'm not looking to to
 
06:13:03.670 --> 06:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just no I I don't want to pass any
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
just I just ra I just raise it because
 
06:13:09.548 --> 06:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
it you know the way it's worded now in
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
each of these you have two offenses
 
06:13:15.230 --> 06:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
negligence or the other or Reckless or
 
06:13:16.868 --> 06:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
the other and the or the other is the
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
same on both of them to to your to your
 
06:13:23.788 --> 06:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
point okay yeah to your to your point um
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
I don't want to pass a confusing I want
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
your your Amendment idea would make it
 
06:13:30.468 --> 06:13:30.478 align:start position:0%
clear to the
 
06:13:33.310 --> 06:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
judge versus this would be like well I'm
 
06:13:36.110 --> 06:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
not sure which the legislative intended
 
06:13:37.628 --> 06:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
right I think that yeah I mean I think
 
06:13:40.150 --> 06:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
you could clear it up just by what I
 
06:13:41.788 --> 06:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
what I would recommend to the committee
 
06:13:43.390 --> 06:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
I think is we'll go ahead and pass it we
 
06:13:45.190 --> 06:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
I'll do a floor amendment to to clear
 
06:13:47.390 --> 06:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
that up and that way we can dispose of
 
06:13:50.590 --> 06:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
it today uh representative sik I was
 
06:13:52.628 --> 06:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
just going to wonder if we would recess
 
06:13:54.150 --> 06:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
this till next Wednesday or whatever the
 
06:13:55.628 --> 06:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
day is we're doing the one other Bill
 
06:13:57.150 --> 06:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
and then have the corrected Amendment
 
06:13:59.868 --> 06:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
for that day so we can vote on a clean
 
06:14:01.590 --> 06:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment once rather than two
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
amendments on the floor yeah that's
 
06:14:06.030 --> 06:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
actually probably a better idea because
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
then it's clean and we don't have to
 
06:14:09.670 --> 06:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
worry about explaining this to everybody
 
06:14:12.590 --> 06:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
on the floor okay so I I we're going to
 
06:14:16.628 --> 06:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
we'll recess this to um March 6th 8th
 
06:14:19.750 --> 06:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
8th Excuse me yes oh you want to be here
 
06:14:22.270 --> 06:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
for that one yeah okay uh this this
 
06:14:24.430 --> 06:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
executive session is recess to March

at me um do I need to stop for a
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
second not at all yeah um before I bang
 
06:14:39.310 --> 06:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
any hammers we're going to take a two
 
06:14:46.910 --> 06:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%

to move adoption of amendment
0855

06:18:34.350 --> 06:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:36.990 --> 06:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
H would you like to speak to your
 
06:18:40.110 --> 06:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
motion um I would Mr chair thank you um
 
06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
after a conversation with the committee
 
06:18:43.390 --> 06:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
it seemed like there would be um more
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
broad support if we could limit the
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill to just make
 
06:18:50.990 --> 06:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
legislative intent clear and ensure that
 
06:18:53.548 --> 06:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
parents aren't being um prosecuted
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily for allowing their kids to
 
06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
have some fun in the woods um without
 
06:19:02.830 --> 06:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
limiting too much um judges discretion
 
06:19:05.788 --> 06:19:05.798 align:start position:0%
when reviewing um potential cases of
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
child abuse thank you um I'll speak to
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
my second I think
 
06:19:13.788 --> 06:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
that with representative Lyn's help
 
06:19:15.670 --> 06:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
today we we took a bill that could have
 
06:19:19.310 --> 06:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
been confusing um the intent was clear
 
06:19:21.190 --> 06:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
and so what we ended up doing was just
 
06:19:23.310 --> 06:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
going back to the intent and we're
 
06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
expressing the intent to the court um
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it clearly said it's not a violation
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
of this section for parents to allow
 
06:19:31.030 --> 06:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
children to take reasonable risks to
 
06:19:32.868 --> 06:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
further their development as independent
 
06:19:35.110 --> 06:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
human beings so that really gives
 
06:19:38.830 --> 06:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
parents actually um broad discretion um
 
06:19:42.030 --> 06:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
to to parent how they wish and it it
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
leaves it the standard of reasonableness
 
06:19:46.350 --> 06:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
which we um have great experience with
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
in our jurist Prudence so um I think
 
06:19:50.990 --> 06:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a good bill and I think
 
06:19:52.990 --> 06:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
everyone who said they would will be
 
06:19:56.590 --> 06:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
happy any further discussion
 
06:19:58.190 --> 06:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
