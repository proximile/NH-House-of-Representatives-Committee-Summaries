just a minute
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
for what reason does the member rise i
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
have a question for the chair
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
state your question thank you mr speaker
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
i've looked at the black book
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i've looked at masons and nowhere do
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
i find a legitimate reason
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
for a deliberative body to choose not to
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
for a deliberative body to choose not to
vote

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
because not to debate because it might
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
take time
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
you can find
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
a mention of a legitimate reason
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.030 align:start position:0%

smith
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that is a fair question
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
to me i the body has a right to make any
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
motion they wish which both sides do
 
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.349 align:start position:0%
motion they wish which both sides do
consistently

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee on labor
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
industrial and rehabilitative services
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
to which was referred house bill 1088
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
act relative to employee protections
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
from covert 19 in the workplace
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate senator greg
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
considered the same be an edible degree
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
with the majority report the
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
pass represent o'brien sullivan for the
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
to speak against the committee report
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.150 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
um

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
1088 an act relative to employee
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
protections from covet 19 in the
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
workplace um its title is pretty
 
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.230 align:start position:0%
workplace um its title is pretty
self-explanatory

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's the flip side to the many anti-vax
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
bills which have been introduced and
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
it says basically you just have the
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
right to be vaccinated against covet 19
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the right to use personal protective
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
equipment such as face masks and face
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
shields while employed in the workplace
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
and no employer shall discriminate in
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
any way against an employee based on the
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
employee exercising his or her rights
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
in this section and um
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
so it is narrowly limited to covet 19
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.589 align:start position:0%
but it
um

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the two of these some well three one
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the assumptions behind her is that
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccines the mass are worthwhile
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
they may not be 100 safe but they're
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
extremely safe certainly much safer than
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
the disease
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
same goes for the mass and ppe so
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
employees should be able to wear them in
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
the workplace to protect themselves
 
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.030 align:start position:0%
the workplace to protect themselves
and

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
all workers have the right to protect
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
themselves it's killed nearly a million
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
americans 966 000 last time i checked
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
which is a couple of days ago and i
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't and um so
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of famous cases
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
about it but there have been some here
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and certainly um there
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
were a number of employers who made the
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
business decision to shut down who
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
specifically cited the first the
 
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
specifically cited the first the
uh

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.109 align:start position:0%
uh
ppe's

00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
ppe's
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
the mass mandates during the state of
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
emergency as a reason why they shut down
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
even though that's a business this
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
season they had many factors in it so
 
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
season they had many factors in it so
um

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
so please uh
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
please protect the right of our workers
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
they have the right to protect
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
themselves and they certainly
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
no one has the right to spread a
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
communicable disease especially one as
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
terrible as covet 19 because even if you
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
survive there's the long-term
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
consequences are in some cases
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
quite quite horrific and life-altering
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
so please and also i believe your
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
employer does not have the right to tell
 
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.230 align:start position:0%
employer does not have the right to tell
you

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
not to protect yourself against
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
a respiratory disease so please uh
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
please overturn the committee report and
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
vote for the series so an alternative
 
00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:40.470 align:start position:0%
vote for the series so an alternative
motion

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
can be introduced thanks
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%

report thank you mr speaker
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
individual speak in favor of this bill
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
and no one against
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
we have no evidence that there is any
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination or has been any
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination that has gone on for
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone unwilling or because someone
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
wants to wear a mask or a shield
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated or not vaccinated

you've all seen me wearing my mask
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
around here it's because i have an 84

makes her happy
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
that i have a mask when i'm in public
 
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
that i have a mask when i'm in public
settings

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%

that's my choice
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%

thank mr speaker
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
i am in the unenviable position
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
of coming before the house today to ask
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
you not to repeal a program that i could
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
not possibly be convinced to vote for
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
i am not going to stand here and pretend
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
like that i think the fmli plan that was
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
passed as part of hb2 and 2021 was a
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
good plan
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it was extremely
 
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it was extremely
regressive

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
regressive
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
were i to draft a paid family medical
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
leave plan it wouldn't look like this
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
for starters it's not universal
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
a private sector employee can only
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
receive the plan's benefits
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
if their employer happens to sign up for
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's no path for an individual to get
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
the coverage as part of a larger state
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
pool without the employer signing up
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
and those benefits
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of your regular income
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
forbes magazine reported in 2021 that
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
six in ten americans live paycheck to
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
paycheck and now it's closer to seven
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
and ten
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
so if you're an administrative assistant
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
making fifty five thousand dollars a
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
year sure you can probably forgo 40 of
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
your income and still be okay
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
however if you're a state liquor store
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
employee who for reasons that escape me
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
only makes 12 an hour
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
that person is expected under the fmli
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
plan in hb2 to live on seven dollars an
 
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.589 align:start position:0%
plan in hb2 to live on seven dollars an
hour

00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
if they take advantage of a plan that
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
both people in this hypothetical pay
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
taxes into
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is an upward redistribution of
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
wealth from the working class to the
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
permanent managerial class and doesn't
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
benefit those who need the program the
 
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
benefit those who need the program the
most

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.950 align:start position:0%
most
however

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
these are not the reasons why a repeal
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
is being discussed i wish it was
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
in committee reasons for repeal of this
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
plan were it costs money it may balloon
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
as more people sign up for it
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
well yes there is no free paid family
 
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.549 align:start position:0%
well yes there is no free paid family
leave

00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you want a program you outline it if
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
it has the kind of popular support that
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
a real and robust paid family leave
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
program has shown to have in polls in
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you pass it and pay for it
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
this to me feels like the affordable
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
care act discussion in 2017.
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
i felt that the plan passed in 2009 was
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
alienating confusing technocratic
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company giveaways without even
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
a public option let alone universal
 
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.430 align:start position:0%
a public option let alone universal
coverage

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
but the answer then wasn't repeal and
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's not the answer now
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
it was improved
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
the minority wants this bill to go to
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
interim study so paid family leave can
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
be improved and made better
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
we should fix this instead of throwing
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
away a bad plan and starting again at
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
turcotte to speak for the committee
 
00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
turcotte to speak for the committee
report

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
as previously stated 1165 would repeal
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave insurance plan
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
part of hb2 last year
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's been touted as a way for the
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
private businesses to get paid family
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
leave insurance for their employees but
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
in fact in the end this is only going to
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
morph into a taxpayer-funded
 
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
morph into a taxpayer-funded
entitlement

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
entitlement
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit of the
 
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit of the
specifics

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
under the current plan
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the nearly 11 000 state employees
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
would have their
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
premiums for this insurance plan
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
how much is that nobody knows the
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
answers because we passed this in hp2
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much it was going to
 
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much it was going to
cost

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
doing my own calculations and
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
you you can
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
you can bet this is going to be in the
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars every
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
year just for the 11 000 state employees
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
again on the backs of the taxpayers
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
this past january 1.9 million dollars
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
was authorized 1.9 million dollars just
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get paid the consultants to look into
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
getting quotes and getting the plan up
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
our last executive session the insurance
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner asked to address our
 
00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner asked to address our
committee

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
they've had
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
to repeal this
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
fmli plan in two different committees
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
nobody from the commissioner's office
 
00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
nobody from the commissioner's office
attended

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
attended
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
so i asked we asked him at the executive
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
session the other day why are you coming
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
here now
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
why didn't anybody show up to these
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
original hearings if this was so
 
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.470 align:start position:0%
original hearings if this was so
important

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
and he had no answer
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
we asked him about a few other things in
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
the current plan fifty percent of the
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
premiums that a business would pay
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
they would get a tax break on it
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
so i asked them
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
what's the net effect on the revenues
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner also made the statement
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
during that hearing
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
that private businesses were very
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
interested in participating in this plan
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
when i asked him how many and what
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
businesses had indicated interest
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
he said he didn't have a number but he
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
thought he recalled some someone talking
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
now there are several other points in
 
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
now there are several other points in
the

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the uh purpose and policy statement
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
contained in the original language
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's in hb2 i'm going to only mention
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
one of them because it's it's kind of
 
00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:54.630 align:start position:0%
one of them because it's it's kind of
interesting

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me it says
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
one of the primary reasons for this is
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining workers
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
this is pure nonsense
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
all we have to do is look at some of the
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
states that already have fmli
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey california illinois
 
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.990 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey california illinois
connecticut

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
note anything in common with those
 
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.829 align:start position:0%
note anything in common with those
states

00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
these are the most heavily taxed states
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
where the residents are fleeing
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
they have the highest net negative
 
00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:26.710 align:start position:0%
they have the highest net negative
migration

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
migration
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
of all the states in our country
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
no one is flocking to these states to
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
now the reason why private and private
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
employers are not going to buy this
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
anyway is extremely expensive
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
during our last term or the last term i
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
was here
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
senator felt has tried putting through a
 
00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:50.549 align:start position:0%
senator felt has tried putting through a
plan

00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
and during that testimony i won't go
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing but there was an
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
individual on our committee who was a
 
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.670 align:start position:0%
individual on our committee who was a
fireman

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
fireman
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
and he bought his own similar
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
type of insurance short-term disability
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
that had less coverage than this fmli
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
insurance plan had
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and he had sixty dollars a week sixty
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
dollars a paycheck every other week
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
taken out of his plan so that's a
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
hundred twenty dollars per employee
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
without getting in boring you with a
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
private businesses are not going to be
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
signing up for this scheme
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to be back to the
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded state employees
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit on the backs of the
 
00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:42.309 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit on the backs of the
taxpayers

00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
i mentioned before
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies now one has already
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
filed and more will follow
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
to start providing similar fmli
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
insurance to private businesses in new
 
00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
insurance to private businesses in new
hampshire

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
outside of the granite state
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
plant that's in our books
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the document from the
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
the most important part and i mentioned
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
it briefly in my reason against tabling
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
is we have an opportunity now a short
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
window before the this thing gets fully
 
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.630 align:start position:0%
window before the this thing gets fully
implemented

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
to remove this off our books and allow
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
to allow the free market to uh
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
do its thing
 
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
do its thing
so

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is dangerous medically
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
what it does is expand the exemptions
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
for vaccine mandates
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
for institutions in schools that accept
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
let's be clear
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a covet bill
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
it exempts all vaccines
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
diseases that have been long
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
been eradicated
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
welcome back to polio
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very dangerous medical
 
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.789 align:start position:0%
this is a very dangerous medical
bill

01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
currently

01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
under our current rules
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exemptions are
 
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exemptions are
allowed

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
under hb
 
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.270 align:start position:0%
under hb
1210

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
1210
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
there's a new exemption
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
currently institutions can create
 
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.109 align:start position:0%
currently institutions can create
policies

01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
to to evaluate whether or not an
 
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
to to evaluate whether or not an
exemption

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
should or should not be accepted
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
under hp 1210
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
employees simply sign a declaration
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
saying that they want an exemption
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
there's no
review

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
it is clear
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the more exemptions there are
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
the more disease we will have
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
since this bill also applies to colleges
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
schools will be less able to protect
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
students from
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
infectious disease
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
one disease that they are very
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
active about protecting is encephalitis
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
students who don't want to get into
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
encephalitis vaccination
 
01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
encephalitis vaccination
won't

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
that puts all students at risk
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
operate in close quarters
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
students live in dormitories
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
they go to class together
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
in groups
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
infectious disease can spread
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
quickly on college campuses
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
colleges often have vaccine mandates
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
again not just against covid against
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
i got a call this morning from the
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
they ran the numbers
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
and have concluded
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
that just for the hospitals
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of medicaid and medicare
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
funding that we are at risk of losing
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
is in the vicinity of 2
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
our hospitals operate at a very
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals have already closed because of
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
economic situations
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
we will lose hospitals if we lose our
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
it is at risk because
 
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
it is at risk because
the

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
the center for
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid services
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
allow for exemptions
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
for medical and religious reasons
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
they do not allow for exemptions
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
if we add that exemption
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
and people
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
act on that exemption
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
we put all of that medicare and medicaid
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
funding at risk
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
this bill also does not allow for
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
those institutions to evaluate
 
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.950 align:start position:0%
those institutions to evaluate
exemptions

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
that is part of the
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
expectation from the cms
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
if we don't follow cms regulations
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
we might hear arguments that other
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
states have done exactly the same thing
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
as this bill intends to do
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
we'll hear that those states have not
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
lost funding for medicare and medicaid
 
01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:28.229 align:start position:0%
lost funding for medicare and medicaid
yet

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's a process
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
when that process takes place it'll be
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
evaluated whether or not our
 
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
evaluated whether or not our
institutions

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
are following the the guidelines
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
if they are found to be in violation of
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
they will be warned
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
this is way too risky for us to
 
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
this is way too risky for us to
undertake

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
i also need to point out that our county
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes that all of us
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
are responsible for taking care of
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
we are all delegates
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
those county nursing homes cannot
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
operate without medicare and medicaid
 
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.229 align:start position:0%
operate without medicare and medicaid
funding

01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
they lose that funding
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be county taxes
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
so essentially if we lose the funding
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
for medicare and medicaid
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're voting for a gigantic
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
increase in county taxes
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
hb 1210
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
is a dangerous bill
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
please vote red
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
on the ought to pass
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're down to our last speaker
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
senator blasic has requested a roll call
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
as that sufficiently seconded
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members take your seats
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.470 align:start position:0%

you heard a lot of
really

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
tough and dangerous talk just now
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
while i respect my colleague
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
on the labor committee i
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
vehemently disagree i think we're
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
looking at two vastly different bills
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
the labor committee had about i'd say 10
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
or 11 bills that came for us that had to
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
covert related issues
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the things the labor
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee tries to do at all costs is
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
not to get in between business
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the legislature we try to tell them
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
what to do except for things of safety
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation where people have
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
a waiver if they had a medical reason or
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if you didn't have a
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
medical reason and you're not overly
 
01:13:19.679 --> 01:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
medical reason and you're not overly
religious

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
what happens if you were
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
put on the spot explain to me exactly
 
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.990 align:start position:0%
put on the spot explain to me exactly
why

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
medically you are unable to do this
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
explain to me exactly why
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
you have a problem you cannot take this
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
because of a religious reason
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
so the concept came up
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
of personal
 
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
of personal
um

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
right of conscience so what is right of
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
it means something within you says i do
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
not want to do this for my personal
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
reasons that has never been offered
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
the goal of all the pieces of
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that we had we brought them
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
down to one
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
had a study committee and came up with
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
what you see now
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to provide individuals the
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.070 align:start position:0%
the bill was
very

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
well crafted
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
and has nothing to do with what mike you
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
heard just previously
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
do you really think
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
that after 14 years here as a chairman
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee i am going to put my
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
name on a piece of legislation that
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
takes two billion dollars away from new
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and closes every single
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are contracts
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
between the federal government
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
and providers of medicare and medicaid
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
we do not want to get involved in
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
between that contract
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
those contracts do say
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are required for certain
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
things or you're not going to get the
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
money no doubt
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get in between that
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
what this allows
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
is someone to be able to say hey i have
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
a right of conscious here i'm going to
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
sign a piece of paper and say i've
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
written a conscience
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
it has to be accepted by the employer
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
at that point the employer
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
can say well i'm sorry thank you very
 
01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
can say well i'm sorry thank you very
much

01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
but that is what is required under our
 
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
but that is what is required under our
contract

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you can no longer have your
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
job here
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
at which
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
they could go to unemployment and other
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms or this opens up the ability
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
for any medical institution or whatever
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
to say okay we accept that
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to keep you we can put you
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and do something else
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
which is not going to be in violation of
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we've given the employee
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
a new mechanism
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
right of conscience
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
and we also haven't gotten in between
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
now what will happen after that if
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
they're consistent
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the employer is consistent with
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
how they rule on each one of these
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
things sorry can't do it it's in
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
violation of our contract we will lose
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
all the funding we get from the federal
 
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.709 align:start position:0%
all the funding we get from the federal
government

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something else with you
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it won't be in violation
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
or you can go to unemployment
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
up until about a month ago unemployment
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
and securities told us they had 200
 
01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:31.030 align:start position:0%
and securities told us they had 200
people

01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
filed for unemployment claims
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
through medical institutions because
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to take the vaccine
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of those were
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
provided benefits as long as there was
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
consistency with what the employer did
 
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
consistency with what the employer did
so

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
we kind of very narrowly put this
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
together it's not as much as some people
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
would like trust me we have some people
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
say you didn't go far enough
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
we wanted you to make sure that that
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
person for the conscious has a job no
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
we can't do that ladies and gentlemen
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
because we would be putting this money
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
in in jeopardy
 
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.470 align:start position:0%
in in jeopardy
so

01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
in recap we gave them
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
individuals so you now have medical
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
religious right of conscience
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
but the we have not interfered with the
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
contract between the employer
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
and the federal government
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
and we've given everyone as best options
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can we didn't go overboard
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
negative things that came out of kovitt
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
which we all know
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
i call it the great overreaction
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
but we did the best we could
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i stand here today
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
this committee the majority of the
 
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
this committee the majority of the
committee

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
did not and does not feel
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
that they have put two billion dollars
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
is going to put medical institutions
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes out of
 
01:17:55.199 --> 01:17:56.790 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes out of
business

01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
it is a very narrowly written bill and
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
if it's not read correctly
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
it will look like we did do that
 
01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.790 align:start position:0%
it will look like we did do that
um

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to support the
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation about to pass
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%

amended were to become law
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire would place our
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
health care providers in direct conflict
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine requirements and

incentives for medicare and medicaid
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
services potentially causing them to

funding
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that house bill
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
1210 attempts to create a right of
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
conscience in the state that
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
a state law that is in direct conflict
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the federal vaccine requirements
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the language in
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
hb 1210 requires that any exemption
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
request made either for religious
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
medical or right of conscience must be
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
granted which is in clear violation of
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the federal vaccine requirements placing
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on our businesses and
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
health care providers once again putting
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
at risk billions of dollars in medicare
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
and medicaid funding
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
if i know that hb 1210 seeks to usurp
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%

01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%

unalienable
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%

this bill if enacted

would index

that is

the if this bill is enacted
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
the maximum number of weeks of coverage

would be 16 weeks

if the unemployment rate is 3 percent
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
with that time

at an eight percent rate of unemployment
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
this bill has a good objective
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
to get people back to work but
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is a bad methodology for doing that
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire unemployment benefit
 
01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.830 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire unemployment benefit
system

01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
already has built-in incentives for
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
people to get back to work
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
it only pays a portion of
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
the earnings claimants make prior to
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%

going on unemployment it has a 26 week
limit

01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.550 align:start position:0%
limit
and

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
and
claimants

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
must be actively looking for work and
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
rules in place to help ensure that this
 
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.390 align:start position:0%
rules in place to help ensure that this
happens

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
but the proof is in the pudding
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
the vast majority
 
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
the vast majority
of

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
people who apply for and get
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
do not use all 26 weeks
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
so who are
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
the relatively few
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
people who do
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
well this bill would appear to assume
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they are freeloaders
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
take advantage of
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
a golden goose
 
01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
a golden goose
and

01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bill then assumes
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the time they should have for
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
finding a job should be linked to the
 
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.510 align:start position:0%
finding a job should be linked to the
state

01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%

unemployment rate
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is illogical
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate does not take into
 
01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.189 align:start position:0%

importantly
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account the

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
they ignore the possibility that someone
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
would choose to stay in a particular
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
field of endeavor rather than take
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
whatever is available on the market
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
and generally they
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
do not relate it all to anomalies at any
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
point in time in the job market relevant
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
to a particular person
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
as addressed by the state unemployment

01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker very few people
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.149 align:start position:0%
 
those

01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:58.950 align:start position:0%
those
who

01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
those relative few who stay
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
unemployed longer
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
than others
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
often face challenges that most of us
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
aren't facing
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
their circumstances are peculiar to them
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.830 align:start position:0%
not to
a

01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
determined state average unemployment
 
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.149 align:start position:0%
determined state average unemployment
rate

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
for this minority of job seekers
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
reducing the benefit period
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
because of a low unemployment rate
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
would have a cruel
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
and punitive effect
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:38.870 align:start position:0%
on them
and

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
in respect to their circumstances and
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
also on their families
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
this bill if enacted
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
could create further welfare benefit
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
exact other demands on our safety nets
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
and even potentially exacerbate
 
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.830 align:start position:0%
and even potentially exacerbate
homelessness

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
our current system works
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote against
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill so that a motion for itl can
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
be made
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're down to our last speaker a roll
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
call has been requested by
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte is that
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is officially seconded this will be a
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
roll call vote members take your seats
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
hb 1337 is a common sense and rational
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
approach to unemployment that has proven
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
successful in the other states that
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
has implemented such a plan
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
businesses see their unemployment
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
compensation insurance rates decline
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it also allows the state's trust
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
fund to be strengthened
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
remember businesses are the ones who pay
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
for all the unemployment compensation in
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
florida i'll give you one example is the
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
shining star of where this has happened
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
at one point during the 2008 finite
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
financial crisis
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
its trust fund had swung to a negative
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion dollar
 
01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion dollar
loss

01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
after a few years of implementing this
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
type of a plan
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
it swung positive 3.9 for a net gain of
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
5.6 billion
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
and florida now enjoys the lowest
 
01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:44.149 align:start position:0%
and florida now enjoys the lowest
unemployment

01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
insurance rates in the country
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
as the previous speaker mentioned this
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
does tie the length of time one can
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
receive the employment
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
compensation to the employ unemployment
 
01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
compensation to the employ unemployment
rate

01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
the maximum of 26 weeks does not change
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
and it does reduce
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh down to when whenever the
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is less than three
 
01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is less than three
percent

01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend for a minute the
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard take your
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
one other issue that came up in uh
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
and was a few of the reasons why we had
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
changes in the the amendment
 
01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
changes in the the amendment
were

01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns over what would happen in
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
case of uh like the financial crisis in
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
2008 or even the recent covert crisis
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
where we had individuals on
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment for extended lengths of
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
time the the deputy commissioner
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
actually actually made the point that he
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't concerned about it only because
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government had stepped in to
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
extend those benefits
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
even with that i decided to put an
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
additional provision into the language
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
that would give
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
the governor an extreme circumstances
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the covert 19 the the ability
 
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.709 align:start position:0%
similar to the covert 19 the the ability
to

01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
adjust those
 
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
adjust those
rates

01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the good news about this there is
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no financial downside risk
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
the only probability for a positive
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
upside for both the state's trust fund
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
and more importantly the businesses who
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
will see their unemployment taxes go
 
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.270 align:start position:0%
will see their unemployment taxes go
down

01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does have a pretty good
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
system now this bill would only make it
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
better i ask that you support the otp
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
motion by pressing the green button
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
report of what the pass has amended on
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 1337
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the majority
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on house bill
 
01:40:32.239 --> 01:40:35.590 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on house bill
1337

01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan for
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
that our unemployment benefit program is
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
working effectively as it is
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that the
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
relatively low level of unemployment
 
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.390 align:start position:0%
relatively low level of unemployment
benefits

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the requirement to seek employment
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
provide a strong incentive for folks to
 
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:09.990 align:start position:0%
provide a strong incentive for folks to
seek

01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
seek
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
to return to work
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that a small group
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
of individuals find it very difficult to
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
find a new job
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
due to age
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
physical frailty
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
or family circumstances and therefore
 
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.149 align:start position:0%
or family circumstances and therefore
need

01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
26 weeks of benefits available
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of the unemployment rate
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
would i then
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that another

01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
at the workplace where the employer
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
makes this case
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
against unionizations

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
because workers must attend
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
an employee and employers make dire
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
claims about the consequences of

claims about the consequences of
unionization

01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
unionization
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
and those who question the company line

can face discipline
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
or termination
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that happens
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%

derision

01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%

followed by supervisor one-on-ones
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
as the primary means through which
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
employers deliver threats
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
and engage in interrogation
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
employers use
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
these supervisors
 
01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.709 align:start position:0%

percent of the time
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
employees use survey surveillance in
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
there are laws against
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
firing employees for organizing union
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%

an employee is fired for the purpose of
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
employers own their business but they
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
don't own their employees
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
employers are free citizens

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
that more often than not
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the trenches no one has clean hands
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
management may say something that
 
01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:34.550 align:start position:0%
management may say something that
is

01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.149 align:start position:0%
is
against

01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
forming the union and say well you're
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to spend money on this and this
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
and you may not get that union on the
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
other hand will say yeah but we'll get
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
you this this and this
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
so then each one uses the media to see
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
what we can do that they can do to try
 
01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
what we can do that they can do to try
to

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:50.310 align:start position:0%
to
dissuade

01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
dissuade
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
an opinion national labor relations
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
board is in place does their job gets
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
the bill was one-sided
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
said that management can't say anything
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
negative about a union well what about
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
why do we have a one-sided bill that was
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
the majority couldn't get past
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do something it needs
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
to be fair for all
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the national labor relations
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
board does
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
they try to get involved when things get
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
out of control and bring things back to
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
where they should be so we had a bill
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
that was not equal to both
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have an organization that is already
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
in place to do things
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as i said
 
01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.629 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as i said
things

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't always aren't always pretty
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we're making legislation and
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're not always pretty
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
a group is trying to organize
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is not the best system but the best
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
one we have
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so far it seems to be working so i
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
would request that the members of the
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
committee or excuse me the members of
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
the house support the labor committee
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
position of inter-speeding to legislate
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i would like a division
 
01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i would like a division
vote

01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%

the question a roll call has been
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
requested is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
it is not sufficiently seconded this
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%

mr speaker colleagues this is not the

proposed pay increase for the members of
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is these numbers are the number or
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the amounts that people lost
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
when they were working a job
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the and the owners sold the company
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
but did not
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
provide that their vacation hours would
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
be transferred to the next employer he
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
did not pay them out so they lost a
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
combined total of two thousand two
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty one dollars and forty

four cents
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
many of us think that's not that
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen that's the wrong way to
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
handle your employees that what should
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
happen is that you would transfer
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
everything to the new employer or pay
 
02:04:42.639 --> 02:04:48.709 align:start position:0%
everything to the new employer or pay
them

02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
18 days
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
144 hours at 16.32 cents per hour
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
2300 dollars 50 cents
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
23.50 and 8 cents
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
that is what another employee lost when
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
she was told today is your last day
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
you you may have vacation hours and this
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
cut this employer had the policy
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
of if you did not use all your vacation
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
hours during the year they would not it
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
would not say use it or lose it but they
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
would pay you a very progressive company
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
they would pay you what you hadn't used
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
but it when terminated
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
they did not pay because this employee
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
unable to request the vacation time two
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance per the policy because
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
she had no notice of the other being
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
laid off
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
she lost twenty three hundred dollars
 
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.910 align:start position:0%
she lost twenty three hundred dollars
now

02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
while the other people were fortunate to
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
have a job to go to this this person had
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
to go and collect unemployment
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
which i think probably hurt the
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
small enough but it still impacted the
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
02:05:52.639 --> 02:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
trust fund
so

02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
i've been working on this for a few
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
years now with my good friend from
 
02:05:58.639 --> 02:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
years now with my good friend from
hudson

02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
hudson
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
the man with the wonderful thai
 
02:06:01.599 --> 02:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
the man with the wonderful thai
collection

02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
collection
 
02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
collection
and

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
we began this quest because he was
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
interested in using or losing
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
the practice where an employer says you
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
know you get this much time in a
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
calendar year or your anniversary date
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't use it you lose it
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing has nothing to do
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
with that that's practice remains does
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
not affect it
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
this bill only comes into effect
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
when the company is sold
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
or there's a layoff and a permanent
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
layoff at that because we heard from the
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
people who paved the roads at the
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
seasonal employer if you lay them off
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know you're probably going to come
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
them back so this is a permanent the
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that we'll talk about later it
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
deals with that so it's only two special
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we think
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
when an employer writes their policy
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
that says i don't pay a termination
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
that termination can have many many
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
causes without where the employee is
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
blameless has not uh caused the trouble
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
at work has done their job
 
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:00.950 align:start position:0%
at work has done their job
has

02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
obviously been paying 16.32 cents an
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
hour had done a good job for the seven
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
years she worked there
 
02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
years she worked there
and

02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's just not right for
 
02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
the employee to suffer
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
when they have no role in this it was
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
beyond their control and all of a sudden
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
what was on their pay stub whether it
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
was paper digital it's gone
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
so i asked you to overturn
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
the committee report so that we might
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
and pass that so i can stop bothering
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
you and i want to do this again next
 
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
you and i want to do this again next
year

02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
does this member yield for a question
 
02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.790 align:start position:0%
does this member yield for a question
yes

02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
you may inquire
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
according to the bill it says that this
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
only takes effect if the company is sold
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
or transferred or if it's a layoff if
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
you have a worker who has accrued a
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
thousand or two thousand dollars in
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
unpaid time vacation time sick time
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
something like that and they walk off
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
the job they quit it doesn't apply to
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
that it does not all right thank you
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
last speaker the member from manchester
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative infantine is recognized
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
 
02:08:16.239 --> 02:08:18.069 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
report

02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
employers choose many different ways
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
to offer enticements or benefits to
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
their employees to be good employers to
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
have good employees you must offer these
 
02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.109 align:start position:0%
have good employees you must offer these
things

02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
some are health benefits disability
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
vacation time sick time but the way each
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
company does this is very different
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
depending on what kind of a business
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
they are if they're seasonal uh they
 
02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.589 align:start position:0%
they are if they're seasonal uh they
have

02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
busier times slower times
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether they offer bonuses on a
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis for exceptional
 
02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis for exceptional
production

02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
production
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
or any of these things some say well
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get two weeks vacation
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
five sick days
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
and five personal days other companies
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
have said we're going to take that
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
entire amount we're going to give you
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent to three weeks to use what
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
however you choose whether it's vacation
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
time personal time or sick time
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
it varies
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the labor committee we try not to
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
tell businesses what to do and how to do
 
02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.790 align:start position:0%
tell businesses what to do and how to do
it

02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
for example my company chooses to
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
provide people with vacation time
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
and they want them to use the vacation
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
time i want them to be fresh i want them
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
to take that time with their families
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and do what they need to do to enjoy
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year i don't want them
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
to carry it over to other times i want
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
them to use it
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
right but i will if they don't use their
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
sick time roll it over because something
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
terrible happens where you're sick for a
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
month you want them to have those
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
benefits those are decisions i make as
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
an owner
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
other other owners make other decisions
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
on how they're going to do it and we try
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
not to interfere
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to say is that
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
vacation time and sick time is earned
 
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
vacation time and sick time is earned
money

02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a benefit but it's cash in hand
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
now we're here every once in a while
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
especially with some organized
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities or something where
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
someone will retire
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
and they haven't taken sick time in five
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
years or vacation in five years and they
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
walk away with a large check that's fine
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
because that's negotiation with the
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
union and that's what was developed
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
again labor committee not getting
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
involved with a private business or a
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
private municipality and their employees
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do the same thing here
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
we do not want to tell employers
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
that sick time unused sick time and
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
is cash in hand to take with them if
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
that is not if that is the intent of the
 
02:10:47.199 --> 02:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
that is not if that is the intent of the
owner

02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
owner
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
then it's in the employer's manual
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
if it is not the intent of the employer
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be telling that they should
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
have to do that and that is the only
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
difference i don't disagree with the
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
previous speaker if a business wants to
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's up to the individual business the
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
individual owner and how they treat
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
their employees and what's their
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
employee manuals
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't like to interfere with that
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
so i would ask you to support
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation of it expedient to
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislate and i would like a division
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
the roll call has been requested by who
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
the representative chair cut request
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
roll call and it is sufficiently
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee report of an expediency
 
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
committee report of an expediency
legislate

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote the member from
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
newmarket representative cahill is
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%

02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with the previous speaker my
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
good friend from manchester
 
02:13:38.639 --> 02:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
good friend from manchester
that

02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
hour isn't these policies are set by the
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
employer that's that's a good situation
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
to have and i know that in many cases
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
most cases the employer will use
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
something else beside the law they'll
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
use their conscience something will tell
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
them what they should and shouldn't do
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
what's the right thing to do
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't always go that way and if
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
i know that this law
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
would only cover two very narrow
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances which i think most of us
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
will agree
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
were egregious they were not handled
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
well they would they would not fair to
 
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
the employer to the employee would i
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
then vote green sorry
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
red to defeat the itl so that another
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative infantine is recognized
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%

02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
there are always circumstances that we
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
can't account for but not everything has
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be in law
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
and by a further know that we do not
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
tell businesses for the most part except
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
for safety type things
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
what to do then i would request that you
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
support the majority report of itl thank
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote if you are in

02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%

speaker mr speaker if i know there
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's little chance that
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the necessary percentage will be
 
02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.790 align:start position:0%
the necessary percentage will be
received

02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know the testimony was that
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
since each and every
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
change that would need be needed to be
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
included on and shown to the voter that
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
the ballot for this question would be 12
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
leading to much confusion and wasted
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
resources would i now request and follow
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker

if i know that this is a very important
 
02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:18.709 align:start position:0%
if i know that this is a very important
cacr

02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this cacr has passed
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
this house before with a bipartisan
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
majority and it has also passed
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
the other body with a bipartisan
 
02:19:29.439 --> 02:19:30.629 align:start position:0%

majority
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
that back in 1998 56 of voters have
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of the cacr and i believe
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
we've come a long way since 1998
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that today we would
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
have had the requisite support from the
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
population to pass the caacr would i now
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
pat press the red button so that we can

02:19:59.790 --> 02:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay cr
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
cacr23 on the table if you're in favor
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
if i know that removal of a member of

this house
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
for insurrection and rebellion would be
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
difficult task
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill is vague
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the language is poor and there's no
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
procedure outlined for removal in the
 
02:24:05.359 --> 02:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
procedure outlined for removal in the

02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a political weapon
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
by one party against the other
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
would i vote with the majority of
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislative administration
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and vote the color of my jacket
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative marshall is recognized
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
disqualification clause of the 14th
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
amendment already prohibits those who
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
engage in insurrection
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
and rebellion from holding any public
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
office and at this time even without the
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
a member can be removed or not seated
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new hampshire
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
constitution gives the new hampshire
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
house under part 2 article 14
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire senate under part
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
2 article 29 the sole authority to rule
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the qualifications of their members
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
but if i know that there is no authority
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
under current statute to call a special
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
election if either body disqualified a
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
member for violating the 14th amendment
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore an entire district
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
of this house or if the other body could
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
remain unrepresented for an entire
 
02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
remain unrepresented for an entire
biennium

02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
then would i push the red button so that
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
we can ensure that all of our citizens
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%

the membership
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the joint fiscal committee
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
has not historically been
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the composition of that committee
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
has historically followed the same
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
proportional representation as other
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
committees in both chambers however if i
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
also know
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately in recent years
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
the membership count and the party
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
balance on that committee has become a
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
partisan issue
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the process
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
is no longer working and that the
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
parties are no longer balanced on that
 
02:40:37.359 --> 02:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
parties are no longer balanced on that
committee

02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
and if i know mr speaker that the
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is not about any
 
02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is not about any
current

02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
issues but that it is looking towards
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that moving forward
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
future legislatures our successors in
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%

02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
four six twenty years from now
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
won't have to worry about the membership
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
of this joint fiscal committee becoming
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
a partisan football regardless of which
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
party is happening to be in control of
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%

1987 we have not had that problem
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%

02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
the members
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
will not affect the great work that's
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
currently done and has been done by the
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the change is
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because they continue to
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
work well together and will continue to
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
work well together regardless of who
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
appoints them

printed on house record 10 a on page 16.
 
02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
for what reason does the member rise
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little too late because we're
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
already into the amendment so wait a
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i have been
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
working on the article 5 issue for well
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
over a decade
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
and if i have been approached over the
 
02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:43.110 align:start position:0%
and if i have been approached over the
years

02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
by members of both parties and used as a
 
02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:47.110 align:start position:0%
by members of both parties and used as a
resource

02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
resource
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to the nuance of article five
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the us federal constitution
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i am in firm agreement
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the intent and principles behind
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
however mr speaker
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
if i have also found that the language
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill is unenforceable under
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if i have found mr speaker that the
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
language in this bill is unfortunately
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
overly broad
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
and could interfere with the state's
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
ability to engage in other interstate
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
conventions and pacts unrelated to
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the u.s constitution
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
for example mr speaker if this could
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the ability of new
 
02:47:39.389 --> 02:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire to participate in periodic
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
renegotiations of things like the
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
interstate driver's license compact
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
which we kind of need would i now press
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative wallace is recognized for
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr speaker
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this body
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
passed an identical bill in 2015 by a
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan three to one majority and mr
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
speaker if i further know that the body
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall behind me
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
passed the bill on on a voice vote
 
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i further know that
 
02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto was due to the need
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
for this legislation was in the future
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the future is now
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that we
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
are only a couple of states away from a
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
convention call with two states filing
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
resolutions just in the time period
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
since this bill was introduced would now
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
press the red button
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
to stop this tabling motion so another
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the question is whether lay house bill
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
1170 on the table this is a roll call
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
vote if you're in favor you'll be
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
pressing the green button if you're
 
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
opposed you'll be pressing the red
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%

02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:49:20.390 --> 02:49:20.400 align:start position:0%

passed this bill
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
both sides admitted in hearings and on

the floor that unless any convention of

the states occurred in new hampshire
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
the event would probably be outside
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
the state's jurisdiction and the
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of our laws and have no

of the states in our country's history
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%

02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
has either type of convention resulted
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a loss nor erosion of anything in any
 
02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
state nor federal bill of rights
 
02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
whenever conventions meandered outside
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
the scope of a delegates commission
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
they have always returned to their
 
02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
respective state legislatures to seek
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
guidance and were allowed to do so
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
is that it provides a false sense of
 
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
security to legislatures
 
02:51:32.710 --> 02:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
to legislators sorry
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
since 269 members of congress if we're
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
talking about an article 5 convention
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
269 members of congress can bypass our
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
state legislatures and choose state
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions as they did with
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
the 21st amendment
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
while three other states have laws in
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
place for state ratifying conventions
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
even allowing voters to elect delegates
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
to a state ratifying convention who are
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
committed to a no vote
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
this house rejected that bill when i
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
introduced it a few years ago
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
worse state law has
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
that the governor not the general court
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
makes the appointments to conventions of
 
02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the states such as with the uniform law
 
02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:15.830 align:start position:0%
the states such as with the uniform law
commission

02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
most state legislatures make those
 
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
appointments themselves still worse is
 
02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
that if this bill
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
if it were successful in binding any
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
delegate would automatically take our
 
02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:28.389 align:start position:0%
delegate would automatically take our
delegate

02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
delegate
 
02:52:30.070 --> 02:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
out of the debate on any proposed
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment if someone
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
discovered structural or constitutional
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
issues since they wouldn't be allowed to
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
vote on an amendment to the amendment or
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
any change to the amendment late
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
proposals at that convention of states
 
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
could not raise the debt ceiling without
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
a the ascent of three quarters of state
 
02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures or limiting the scope of
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
spending cuts in a balanced budget
 
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
amendment which were two states away
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
from now
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
might prevent our delegate from voting
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
on the matter
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is the worst idea since the
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
cia spent 20 million dollars on studies
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
to find out whether human beings had
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
psychic powers if we'd had psychic
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
powers we'd have known to itl this bill
 
02:53:19.110 --> 02:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:21.030 --> 02:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the member from durham representative
 
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
horrigan is recognized to speak against
 
02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
how is it okay
 
02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
how is it okay
actually

02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker i guess i
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
originally thought i was signed up to do
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
a pi but plans have changed but
 
02:53:41.680 --> 02:53:43.110 align:start position:0%
a pi but plans have changed but
um

02:53:43.110 --> 02:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:43.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
the main problem with this bill is that
 
02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:46.550 align:start position:0%
the main problem with this bill is that
it's

02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
our an article five convention is it's
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
not imminent it's not on the horizon um
 
02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:55.110 align:start position:0%
not imminent it's not on the horizon um
i

02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
if one happens
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have plenty of uh plenty of lead
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
craft a bill similar
 
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
cr well crafter bill covering the same
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
subject matter as this
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's not you know we're not going to
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
have one next week we're not you know
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have one
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
for quite some time if we have one at
 
02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:15.990 align:start position:0%
for quite some time if we have one at
all

02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:54:18.469 --> 02:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
but then the second problem is
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the rules for this
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
convention is even if it's a so-called
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
assembly of the states whatever body
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh convenes that amendment will set its
 
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
own rules they're probably
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to have nothing whatsoever
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the detail in this bill
 
02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:35.349 align:start position:0%
to do with the detail in this bill
and

02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:35.359 --> 02:54:36.309 align:start position:0%
and
also

02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
the whole basic concept that we're
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to remove these delegates if
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
they approve and under a so-called what
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
what the term is un
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendment
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
they'll have the same rights that we
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
have as members of the new hampshire
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
house the same rights as members
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
congress has those are guaranteed not
 
02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
just by the u.s and state constitutions
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
but by common laws so
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
when we're on the floor of the
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
convention the people of the our
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
district can't can't remove us just
 
02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't like our vote at
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
least and the same will same go for
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
those delegates regardless of whether
 
02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's an article 5 convention could mean
 
02:55:10.950 --> 02:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
by congress
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
or some other some other body
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
then finally let's say let's say they do
 
02:55:19.349 --> 02:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
let's say the body does vote for some
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
unapproved uh unapproved amendments um
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
those still have to be ratified by
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
a super majority of the states that's
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
very difficult it's happened i think
 
02:55:28.319 --> 02:55:29.670 align:start position:0%
very difficult it's happened i think
only

02:55:29.670 --> 02:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
now i forget the exact number but i
 
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
think it's 26 times in uh
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
250 years
 
02:55:37.830 --> 02:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
so anything that this convention passes
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be harmless unless it's
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular there's a very broad
 
02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:42.389 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular there's a very broad
consensus

02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we should change the constitution
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
or even
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
i suppose theoretically they could even
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh enact a new conference constitution
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
people talk about the articles of
 
02:55:54.469 --> 02:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
convention the runaway convention
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to just amend the
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
articles confederation that was a
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
convention that caused the u.s
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
constitution which has uh
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
served us well since 1789.
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
the member from
 
02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
and the the member from manchester
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
already mentioned this but this bill
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
this particular version of it is so
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
broadly written it covers the members of
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
i believe there's 41 interstate compacts
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with things as big as driver's
 
02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
dealing with things as big as driver's
licenses

02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
or things as small scale as our
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
interstate school districts in the
 
02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
rivendell school district and the
 
02:56:28.399 --> 02:56:29.670 align:start position:0%
rivendell school district and the
hanover

02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
hanover
 
02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
the dresden school district in the
 
02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
hanover area of the rivendell school
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
district up in the upper valley the
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut river so this uh
 
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill is you know this bill is
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's premature
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it would have some very bad
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
so we should uh
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
we should
 
02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
we should overturn the octopass's
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and itl today and we can
 
02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:53.110 align:start position:0%
amendment and itl today and we can
always

02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
revisit this once we know
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a convention we'll plenty of
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
time to revisit it once we know what the
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
framework for the convention will
 
02:57:02.230 --> 02:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
actually be
thanks

02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
all right we are at the final speaker
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
and a division was requested on this so
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
start migrating back
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
remember from danville representative
 
02:57:22.630 --> 02:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
wallace is recognized to speak in
 
02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative wallace waves off the pi
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
so this will be a division vote members
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:32.560 --> 02:59:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee report of house bill 1170.
 
02:59:32.230 --> 02:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan is recognized
 
02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
so if i know that
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1170 is totally unnecessary no
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention is going to happen
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know in the very near future may
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
happen someday but it's
 
03:00:02.550 --> 03:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
it'll happen
 
03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
and if i do know it's premature we will
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
know when such a convention is called
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to know well in advance
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
we'll have plenty of time to
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
write another bill
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
um if i know also this bill a lot of the
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
details in the bill are highly
 
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
questionable in fact it's probably
 
03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
questionable in fact it's probably
unconstitutional

03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:00:23.349 --> 03:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
the members would have the same rights
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities as those of any
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
other legislative body such as the us
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
congress or this house you know so
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things in the bill are
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
things that's just sort of the state
 
03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:34.550 align:start position:0%
things that's just sort of the state
cannot

03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
03:00:36.469 --> 03:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
cannot do and
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
finally this also interferes with our
 
03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
participation over 40 interstate
 
03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:43.190 align:start position:0%
participation over 40 interstate
compacts

03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be a problem if i know
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
i apologize for leaving out the if i
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
know so if i know this feels unnecessary
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
if i know it's premature if i know it
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
adversely affects our participation over
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
40 interstate compacts
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%

thank you very much madam speaker
 
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1046 is a simple and straightforward
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
bill brought to the municipal and county
 
03:16:58.229 --> 03:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
government committee by sullivan county

delegates

03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
delegates
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
it would allow voters in each of the
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
three districts of sullivan county to be
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
the only ones
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
to elect their county commissioner
 
03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
presently each voter in sullivan county
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
has a say in who gets elected
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
to every other county district
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
even if the voter does not reside in
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
that district
 
03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
none of whom live in sullivan county
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
say that it is not clear
 
03:17:32.790 --> 03:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
and needs more study
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
well eight of the ten counties in new
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make much sense does it
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's an anomaly in new hampshire
 
03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
it's an anomaly in new hampshire
elections

03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
elections
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
only carroll county elects their county
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners this way besides sullivan
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
county but belknap chester
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
cheshire coast grafton hillsborough
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
merrimack rockingham and stratford elect
 
03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners by district
 
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
and only by the voters that reside in
 
03:18:10.630 --> 03:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
those districts
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
imagine being elected by voters who
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't even live in your district
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
and worse
 
03:18:21.030 --> 03:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
imagining voting for someone who doesn't
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
even live in your district
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
this is the reality for the folks
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
residing in the three districts of
 
03:18:29.830 --> 03:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues don't have people elect other
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
people's representatives
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
let people elect their own
 
03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
let people elect their own
representative

03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
if eight of the ten counties in new
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire can do it
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
so can sullivan county
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
please vote no
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%

03:19:05.349 --> 03:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the committee's
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedient
 
03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
03:19:14.309 --> 03:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 1046 seeks to change the
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
process by which sullivan county
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
commissioners are elected
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
for more than 30 years
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners have been
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
elected by all the voters in the county
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
rather than just a district they
 
03:19:26.319 --> 03:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
rather than just a district they
represent

03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
it is one of three counties
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
carroll stafford and sullivan which used
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
this method
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
to elect the county commissioners
 
03:19:39.190 --> 03:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to limit voters to only
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
those in the district the commissioner
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
seeks to represent
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
during the bill's hearing it was argued
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners should be elected
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
only by those they will be representing
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
it was also mentioned that campaigning
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
is expensive since they have to do
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the county rather than just
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
within the district
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
i wonder what the actual reason for
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
changing from at large the district is
 
03:20:08.070 --> 03:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
is it representation or the cost of
 
03:20:08.080 --> 03:20:09.590 align:start position:0%
is it representation or the cost of
campaigning

03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
campaigning
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
as previously stated carroll county has
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
been using the at large election
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
method for more than 30 years
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
it seems that the at large method for
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
electing commissioners is preferred by
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the voters in this county
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
if this is the voter's wish then why
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
should the method of voting be changed
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
of election be changed
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i ask you press

municipal and county government to which

the default budget
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
in official ballot jurisdictions having

considered the same report the same with

the recommendation that the bill ought
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
to pass representative richard tripp for

the majority of the committee
 
03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having

considered the same and being unable to

agree with the majority report with the
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolved that it is
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative

03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is yet another manipulation of
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
the definition of default budgets in
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
official ballot town meetings
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i know when you hear official town
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
ballot town meetings your eyes are going
 
03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
to roll
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:29:40.630 --> 03:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
and when you hear default budget that's
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
also going to make your eyes roll but
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
here we are again
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
the new language includes
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
less any reduction to an appropriation
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
the governing body made in the proposed
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
so this will now use three different
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
budgets to calculate the default budget
 
03:30:01.590 --> 03:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
for the third fiscal year
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 operating budget and
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
default budgets are based on fiscal year
 
03:30:06.960 --> 03:30:09.429 align:start position:0%
default budgets are based on fiscal year
21.

03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
21.
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
do we need more or less of something
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
have we overspent or underspent
 
03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:14.229 align:start position:0%
have we overspent or underspent
something

03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2022 default default
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
budget is based on the difference
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
between 21 and 22.
 
03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:22.790 align:start position:0%
between 21 and 22.
budgets

03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
were 21 and 22 budgets with the
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
additions and subtractions as specified
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the current rsa
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
the proposed fiscal year 23 budget and
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
subsequent default are based on the
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
operating budget of fiscal year 22.
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
this bill includes contracts in its
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
definition of the default budget
 
03:30:43.520 --> 03:30:45.190 align:start position:0%
definition of the default budget
calculation

03:30:45.190 --> 03:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
03:30:46.710 --> 03:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
the existing rsa there is a definition
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
of contracts saying that contracts
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
previously approved in the amount so
 
03:30:54.560 --> 03:30:55.670 align:start position:0%
previously approved in the amount so
approved

03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
approved
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
are included in the default budget for
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
example in fiscal year 21 the voters
 
03:31:04.630 --> 03:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
approved a three-year contract at twenty
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
during fiscal 20 year 22 a conservative
 
03:31:12.550 --> 03:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciary decision offered the
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
municipality the ability to pay off that
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
last year of the contract that had been
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
approved at 20k
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
for 21 22 and 23.
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill the proposed fiscal year
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
23 and its default budget do not include
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
that contract appropriation because it
 
03:31:32.469 --> 03:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't been because it's been paid off
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
and is no longer needed in the budget
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
but the 20k as previously approved
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
contract included in fiscal year
 
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
2023 default budget because the voters
 
03:31:48.870 --> 03:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
contracted an amount approved in 2021
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
20k for four-year contract paid off
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
no longer necessary but is necessary
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
because that's the definition of
 
03:31:56.640 --> 03:31:57.910 align:start position:0%
because that's the definition of
contracts

03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
so the default budget is going to be
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars more than the
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
the new language in this bill conflicts
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
because it requires that change
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't include the uh money
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we would not have had to
 
03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:15.510 align:start position:0%
that we would not have had to
appropriate

03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
there's an approved contract in the
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
amount so approved but the voters
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
previously had not
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
previously had approved it
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the circular calculation and confusion
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
is one of the problems that the minority
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
had with the
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
and do not agree with the ought to pass
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i asked for a
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
litchfield representative boehm to speak
 
03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
the reason for the municipal budget law
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
was that towns did not have a facility
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
big enough to hold regular town or
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
school district meetings
 
03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
one town i know it had the tv set up
 
03:33:01.760 --> 03:33:02.710 align:start position:0%
one town i know it had the tv set up
between

03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
multiple places
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
so this was passed back i believe 95 and
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
was initially called sb2 so still
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
reference to that sb2 towns and it will
 
03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
only affect those towns that have passed
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
this and school district this bill is
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
if the governing body reduces something
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
in their proposed operating budget they
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
must make the same reduction in the
 
03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
must make the same reduction in the
default

03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
default
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
the argument about contracts contracts
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
will be in both
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating budget and the
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
default budget so that's not an issue
 
03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:41.110 align:start position:0%
default budget so that's not an issue
but

03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
but after a while when the first time it
 
03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
was passed for the first number of years
 
03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
the default was always lower
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
than a proposed operating budget
 
03:33:53.830 --> 03:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
but after a while certain associations
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
and lawyers figure out a way by using
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
the wording of the law to manipulate the
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
default budget to make it higher than
 
03:34:02.950 --> 03:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
the operating budget to ensure that the
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
budget will pass
 
03:34:08.070 --> 03:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
but that was not the intent of the law
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and if you read the section
 
03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:11.670 align:start position:0%
and if you read the section
4013

03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
4013
 
03:34:11.680 --> 03:34:13.830 align:start position:0%

roman

03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
roman
 
03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much says it
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is what's got to be on the warrant
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
shall the local governing body
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
political self raise an appropriate
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
operating budget so much and then it
 
03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:25.830 align:start position:0%
operating budget so much and then it
says

03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:34:28.630 --> 03:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
should this article be defeated
 
03:34:31.590 --> 03:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
then the default budget will be this
 
03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:33.670 align:start position:0%
then the default budget will be this
okay

03:34:33.670 --> 03:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
or the governing body
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
may hold one special meeting in
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
accordance with this law to take the
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
issue of a revised operating budget only
 
03:34:44.239 --> 03:34:45.269 align:start position:0%
issue of a revised operating budget only
so

03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
if your governing body your selectmen or
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
your school board
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a higher default budget
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
and it the
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
warrant passes are they going to have a
 
03:34:57.990 --> 03:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting because they got more
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
money than they asked for i don't think
 
03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:01.750 align:start position:0%
money than they asked for i don't think
so

03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
so that's why they're manipulating the
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
default to be higher
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
what school district is going to follow
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
the law if for example not needing three
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
teachers they are removed from the
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget but left in
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
the default
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
of course the default is going to be
 
03:35:23.279 --> 03:35:24.550 align:start position:0%
of course the default is going to be
higher

03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
if the teacher's contract says they will
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
fund clubs and sports stipends for say
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
for twenty thousand but never spent more
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
than fifteen thousand you guessed that
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating budget will be
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand but the default will be
 
03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand but the default will be
twenty

03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
twenty
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
on the town side if every other year the
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
town buys two police cruises but then
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
then one the next year
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
guess what the year one will have two in
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
the default
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
etcetera it say you know this is not
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
common sense and
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
for example in this year in my school
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
district the proposed operating budget
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
is 23 million 700 000
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
the default is 24 million
 
03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
of course how you people and the people
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
did vote for the
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
operating budget because the default was
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
higher and sometimes they say no and not
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
realizing that they're spending more
 
03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:20.790 align:start position:0%
realizing that they're spending more
money

03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:22.070 align:start position:0%
money
so

03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
and like i said before contracts
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
teachers contract will be an addition
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
not a reduction
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
in both contra and both the proposed so
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be higher because of
 
03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:34.389 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be higher because of
that

03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
the default is higher because of
 
03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:38.469 align:start position:0%
the default is higher because of
manipulation

03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%

03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if i know
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that hb 1070 conflicts with existing
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
laws in numerous ways
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
and if i know that default budgets do
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
not include previously approved
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
contracts such as bond agreements
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that this
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
oversight concerning contracts and bonds
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
will result in a tangle of confusion for
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
towns across the state
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to
 
03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
defeat the majorities ought to pass
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that another motion
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
lasalles to speak in favor of the

committee report
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if i know
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that when you have an
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
issue where budgets continually
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
the default budget comes out greater
 
03:39:23.429 --> 03:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
than the operating budget
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
how would you feel
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you're on a budget committee
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
and spend all those time
 
03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:32.229 align:start position:0%
and spend all those time
times

03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
times

having considered the same report the
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
same with the recommendation that the
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass represent
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative richard tripp for the
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report that the
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolution resolved
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is inexpedient to legislate
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative jim maggiore for the
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
03:43:02.710 --> 03:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:43:05.189 --> 03:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
wrong to speak against the committee
 
03:43:05.199 --> 03:43:08.309 align:start position:0%
wrong to speak against the committee
report

03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1081
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
is one of those bills that tricks you
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
into thinking that an equivalency exists
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
that an action on one side must be met
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
with the same action on the other side
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
in this case that since only a simple
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
majority is needed to form a village
 
03:43:31.359 --> 03:43:32.389 align:start position:0%
majority is needed to form a village
district

03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
that the right thing to do is to change
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
the law so that only a simple majority
 
03:43:39.670 --> 03:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
is needed to dissolve it
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
with village districts
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
nothing could be further from the truth
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
to illustrate my point i will use the
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
merrimack village district as an example
 
03:43:53.110 --> 03:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's my hometown municipal water
 
03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:54.229 align:start position:0%
it's my hometown municipal water
district

03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
it was founded by a simple majority to
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
supply municipal water to the residents
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the time the vote was taken residents
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
did not have municipal water
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
nor did mvd have any assets or capital
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
nor did it have any employees
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
it was nothing but a dream to the voters
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
of merrimack
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
in fact if that vote had failed
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
merrimack residents would have been no
 
03:44:24.229 --> 03:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
worse off than when they were there
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
before the vote was taken
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
a simple majority was exactly that
 
03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
a simple majority was exactly that
simple

03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
simple
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
mvd manages over seven thousand and five
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
hundred service locations
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
which is more than eighty seven percent
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the town
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
these locations include residents
 
03:44:47.429 --> 03:44:47.439 align:start position:0%

more coming online later this year
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
this village district like many others
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%

to acquire bonded debt
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we maintain the same threshold
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
when we are divesting far greater
 
03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:45.590 align:start position:0%

03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
but beyond our fiduciary responsibility
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility to the lives of

making the decision to dissolve those
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
services from our communities is not
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
something to be taken lightly
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
certainly not lighter than a decision to
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
secure a bond
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%

committee report
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1081 really is a simple bill
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to change the legal
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
requirement to dissolve a village
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
district from a two-thirds majority of
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
legal voters to a simple majority of
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
legal voters
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
the simple majority standard is what is
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
a village district should be no harder
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
to dissolve than it was to create the
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
i have had concerns from people asking
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
if the bill allows non-residents to vote
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
the answer is no the standard of voting
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
is like every other election in the
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
state you must be a legally registered
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
voter and only those present and voting
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
are counted that was a court case sugar
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
hill association versus lisbon 1962.
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
during testimony i had questions
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
comparing the bill to a bond
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
which has a two-third majority
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
requirement but was lowered to a
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
three-fifths majority requirement in
 
03:47:48.150 --> 03:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
2020 by this legislature
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
the only way to answer answer the
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
question regarding bonding and village
 
03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
district is that bonding and dissolving
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
a village district are entirely two
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
different subjects
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
finally the minority blurb indicated
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the municipality would absorb the
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
cost of the dissolved district which is
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
rsa 5221 states clearly the selectmen of
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the town or towns in which the district
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
was situated shall assess the taxes and
 
03:48:16.150 --> 03:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
betterment assessments in the same
 
03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:17.110 align:start position:0%
betterment assessments in the same
manner

03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
manner
 
03:48:18.790 --> 03:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
as if the district had not been
 
03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:19.990 align:start position:0%
as if the district had not been
dissolved

03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
to close this bill is about fairness to
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
the voter and i ask you to push green
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
the question on the floor
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
is the adoption of the
 
03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
majority committee report for ought to
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%

03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested

yes that is sufficiently seconded
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the house will
 
03:50:05.910 --> 03:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker madam speaker if
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
i know that dissolving a village
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
district is more than just erasing a
 
03:50:21.760 --> 03:50:22.950 align:start position:0%
district is more than just erasing a
line

03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know that within the boundaries
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
or lines of that village district
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
the residents of that district may have
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
created their own public safety
 
03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
created their own public safety
departments

03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
departments
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
may have hired first responders and
 
03:50:35.359 --> 03:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
may have hired first responders and
employees

03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:50:38.790 --> 03:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
may have built wastewater treatment
 
03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:40.150 align:start position:0%
may have built wastewater treatment
facilities

03:50:40.150 --> 03:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
may have installed infrastructure such
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
as sidewalks street lights parks
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
recreation fields fire hydrants all as
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
permitted by law
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this illusion of such
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
a district would mean that the
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding community would then need to
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
absorb all the costs
 
03:50:58.710 --> 03:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
for that infrastructure employees
 
03:50:58.720 --> 03:50:59.830 align:start position:0%
for that infrastructure employees
maintenance

03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
and long-term payments
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
then finally madam speaker if i know
 
03:51:06.070 --> 03:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the dissolution of the test of the
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
district and said investment should
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
require a two-thirds majority of voters
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
rather than a simple majority
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
then would you please vote red so that
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%

majority to create a village district
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i also know that it should not be
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
any harder to dissolve a village
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
district than it is to create would i
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%

the inexpedient to a legislate
 
03:59:22.150 --> 03:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
on this bill because
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's really
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
to require
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
half an acre
 
03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%

03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why you couldn't have

there's no reason why you couldn't have
one

03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's the requiring that's the problem
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
land costs are a big part
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the cost of a single family house
 
03:59:54.150 --> 03:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
usually you say it's about 20 percent
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
so as
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
people are building houses if i have to

on that lot
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
if we want to encourage
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
the creation of smaller houses at a
 
04:00:23.910 --> 04:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
one thing that we can do
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
is stop
 
04:00:30.550 --> 04:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
artificially requiring
 
04:00:30.560 --> 04:00:31.349 align:start position:0%

lots
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it says you
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
can't require
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
a large lot
 
04:00:39.120 --> 04:00:40.229 align:start position:0%
a large lot
if

04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
it is served by water and sewer which of
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
course is a big important piece of that
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
because we all know that you need x
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
amount of square footage to safely have
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
a well and septic system
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
so this only applies to places that have
 
04:00:56.880 --> 04:00:58.229 align:start position:0%
so this only applies to places that have

and sewer
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't preclude people from
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
buying larger pieces of land
 
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're individuals or
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
developers it just says
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
a really big piece of land
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd remind you is that
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
04:01:19.279 --> 04:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
if you look
at

04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%

famous ones
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
and what you'll see is that
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
in most town centers the lots are
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
considerably smaller than a half an acre
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
when i did the survey for the town i
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
live in
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like our average lot size
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the what you would think of as the
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
village compact
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
is about 8 000 square feet
 
04:01:51.359 --> 04:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
is about 8 000 square feet
so

04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is not an unusual thing to have
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
a smaller lot
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty usual thing
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
and we need to stop requiring bigger
 
04:02:03.199 --> 04:02:04.070 align:start position:0%
and we need to stop requiring bigger
ones

04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
if i know that
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
a very valuable tenant is to treat like
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
things alike
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
and that competitive bidding for
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
community or for counties
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do that and
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
competitive and if i know excuse me if i
 
04:05:20.399 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
competitive and if i know excuse me if i
know

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:05:24.150 --> 04:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
that competitive bidding
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
is a better guarantee for getting better
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
pricing and we all want to have the
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
lowest price available for things that
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
are very important to our counties
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
then would i please vote which way do i
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
then would i please vote against the

vervo for our parliamentary inquiry
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that i voted on the prevailing
 
04:15:44.080 --> 04:15:45.349 align:start position:0%
if i know that i voted on the prevailing
side

04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
but i also
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the gavel came down quickly
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
the true will of the body was not
 
04:15:53.520 --> 04:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
the true will of the body was not
determined

04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
determined
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that the rightful and
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
fair thing to do would be to allow the
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
division vote on the tabling motion
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
but also madam speaker if i believe
 
04:16:08.950 --> 04:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that i do not support removing this bill
 
04:16:13.110 --> 04:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
from the table
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%

04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if i know that we are in
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
the midst of an unprecedented housing

shortage
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we need housing of
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
all kinds to alleviate this crisis
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
if i further know that hp 1087 would
 
04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
make it easier to build single-family
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
homes in areas served by public water
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
and sewer
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that doing so would have
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
zero impact on the beautiful rural parts
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
of our state

be added in suburban areas
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
almost the same bill
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
came through municipal and county when i
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
was there and comes through almost every
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
year this bill
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
tries to override local control by
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
forcing our towns and cities to accept
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings where the voters
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
have only improved the construction of a
 
04:21:29.110 --> 04:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
single family house
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
according to bill quote
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
these may be configured as a single
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
four-unit building two duplex units two
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
single units one duplex unit with two
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
accessory buildings
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%

04:21:43.920 --> 04:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
house with three accessory dwelling
units

04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
units
 
04:21:44.960 --> 04:21:46.229 align:start position:0%
units
really

04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
but you can't have a duplex a townhouse
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
and an accessory for each how about a
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
mini courtyard plus
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
for three plus a whole mcmansion added
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
on or two two houses in a hotel on
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
marvin gardens
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
will this require the towns except a
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
four-story high mini skyscraper like
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
those in downtown manchester near where
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
i used to live
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
should even the inner suburbs of
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
manchester be required by the state
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
to allow buildings that would only fit
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the busier parts of elm street
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
and would buildings on elm street be
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
torn down and replaced with pairs of
 
04:22:23.429 --> 04:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
duplexes contrary to the intent of the
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
planners at city hall who put years and
 
04:22:27.990 --> 04:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
years and years into developing their
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
city's plan a kind of nightmare on elm
 
04:22:29.920 --> 04:22:31.349 align:start position:0%
city's plan a kind of nightmare on elm

04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
street
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
towns like
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
towns like seabrook okay
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
it wasn't meant to be a joke but i guess
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
towns like seabrook are already
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
overloaded with apartment buildings and
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
most people there are now dead set
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
against them i used to serve on my
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
town's planning board and every single
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
member of my planning board was opposed
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
should the state override the will of
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
the voters also
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
should towns like hampton falls and
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
hampton be commanded by another top down
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
one size fits all solution to replace
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
the suburbs with medium density
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings over 40 feet high
 
04:23:07.590 --> 04:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
blocking everyone's view of the water
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
would you want to see your neighborhood
 
04:23:09.120 --> 04:23:10.309 align:start position:0%
would you want to see your neighborhood
overbuilt

04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
overbuilt
 
04:23:12.070 --> 04:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
would you want to explain to angry an
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
angry planning board and other land use
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
boards while you've thrown out years of
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
town planning built around limited
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
municipal services and staff
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
to turn everything
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
into something that looks somewhat like
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
downtown lawrence
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
what will we tell our constituents when
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
we see when they see their property tax
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
rates nearly double because of the
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
sudden need to add to police
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
stations to fire stations another high
 
04:23:35.279 --> 04:23:37.110 align:start position:0%

school
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
to serve a state induced surge in
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
migration and where will already
 
04:23:44.229 --> 04:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
overworked water departments find more
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
water and bigger pipes in towns that are
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
already at their limit
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
or six million dollars for a new
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility how will
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
our emergency rooms and fire departments
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
deal with a large influx of people
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
moving up from lynn and lawrence and
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
north shore mass because thousands of

cheaply built low income stack and pack

or section 8 apartment buildings are
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
only 10 feet apart sometimes not far
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
enough apart
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
for our fire trucks in some of these
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
small towns this bill is the worst idea
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
since congress forced us to pay for
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
giant pink flatulence balloons that cows
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%

for what purpose does the member rise
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%

so

04:30:15.510 --> 04:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i like the remarks i move that the
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate be added
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
i move that the remarks of the previous
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
debate be
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
entered into the permanent journal
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
okay so i already heard an objection the
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
to print the remarks of the previous
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
debate in the permanent journal
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
and a division has been requested
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
members should probably still be in
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.120 --> 04:32:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
bam

04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
all right it's time for members to go to
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to print the
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate in the
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
permanent journal this is a division
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.479 --> 04:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
so like i said this is to print the
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate in the
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
permanent journal if you're in favor
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
you'll press the green button if you're
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
opposed you'll press the red button
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.039 --> 04:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%

house bill 1194
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
proposes a change to the voting process
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
of a tax cap override in a town or
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
district that has adopted rsa 32 colon
 
04:43:33.760 --> 04:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
district that has adopted rsa 32 colon
b-5

04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
b-5
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation requires a
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super-majority vote for tax
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
cap override which is already specified
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
in rsa 32 colon dash c
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
used for budget approval
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bill was proposed as a clarification
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
but is now confusing section b with
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
section c
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
further it has an additional change to
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
include only the first year payment of a
 
04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
multi-year bond in the cap calculation
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
disregarding any debt service
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear what happens after
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
the initial payment or what may accrue
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
the following years
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
capital bonds are voted separately from
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
operating budgets
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the in the first year and then if
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
approved are appropriated in the
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent operating budgets
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
a further concern is that the bond
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
ratings may be affected by the lack of
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed payments that were not
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
considered with this bill
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
it is also it also has no provision for
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
the possibility of rising inflation
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is not as clarifying as it
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
says it wanted to be
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
it leads to more questions than answers
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
for these reasons the minority found
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate and
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
the member from brookline representative
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
power is recognized to speak in support
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise in support
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee recommendation of ought
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
to pass on house bill 1194.
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
year after year new hampshire citizens
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
are faced with increased local spending
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
and escalating tax bills
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
making it extremely difficult for some
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet in the granite state
 
04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1194 helps to address the
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
problem of escalating taxes resulting
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
from unsustainable spending at the local
 
04:45:44.560 --> 04:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
from unsustainable spending at the local
level

04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
currently a tax cap may be adopted with
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
a three-fifth super-majority vote by the
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body and
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
with just a simple majority vote the
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
legislative body can override a tax cap
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses this problem
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
since the purpose of a tax cap is to
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
ensure fiscal responsibility and
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
prudence in spending
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is therefore reasonable that any
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
proposed spending which exceeds the tax
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
cap should
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
have a higher standard to pass than just
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
a simple majority
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
and furthermore since a super majority
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
is required to adopt a tax cap
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense that a super
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
majority should be required to override
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
a tax cap
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
requiring a three-fifth super-majority
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
override will ensure
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
that any spending that exceeds a tax cap
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
is both warranted and is supported by
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative body
 
04:46:53.280 --> 04:46:54.708 align:start position:0%
the legislative body
additionally

04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that in this
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
bill in no way limits the legislative
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
body's authority
 
04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to either increase or decrease the
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
amount of any single appropriation or
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
the total amount of all appropriations
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
puts teeth
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
into a toothless tax cap
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
and it provides an essential tool
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire taxpayers to more
 
04:47:27.840 --> 04:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire taxpayers to more
effectively

04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
manage unsustainable spending and keep
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
local taxes under control
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i urge my fellow
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of ought to
 
04:47:43.440 --> 04:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of ought to
pass

04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
by voting yes on house bill 1194

to create the voting percentage to
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
create a local tax cap
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%

additional language in this bill
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%

numbers that should be used in the
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
analysis for the tax cap and not the
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent years
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%

finally mr speaker if i know that we
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
should preserve the local authority
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
that legislative bodies and school
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
districts need to negotiate their own
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
prudent funding without any additional
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
interference from the state than would i

04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
with increasing local budgets in taxes
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
in towns cities and schools resulting in
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
constantly escalating tax bills
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
year after year making it difficult for
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
our constituents
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%

04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
caps have been enacted in many parts of
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%

tax burdens on our families
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%

04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
to adopt a local tax cap
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
by a three-fifth super majority
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
but allows the legislative body to
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
override the tax cap
 
04:53:10.550 --> 04:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
by but a simple majority vote
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%

04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%

speaker ah so okay we've seen a version
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill before and we've rejected

so again
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
it seeks to limit the authority of city
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
councils to make certain bylaws and
 
05:00:31.520 --> 05:00:32.788 align:start position:0%
councils to make certain bylaws and
ordinances

05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
a responsibility that the citizens who
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
elected them expect them to carry out
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
city councils have brought authority
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
under rsa 47 17
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
to regulate activities taking place
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
within their jurisdictions
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
hb 1268 proposes to delete a key phrase
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
from section 15 of that law
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
that allows municipalities to make any
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
regulations that
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i quote may seem needful for the
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
well-being of the city
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
substituting it with and i quote again
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
to regulate nuisances that interfere
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
with the use and enjoyment of one's
 
05:01:15.040 --> 05:01:16.868 align:start position:0%
with the use and enjoyment of one's
property

05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is classic government overreach
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
not only does hb 1268
 
05:01:25.830 --> 05:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
assume that we in the legislature
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
know more than the local officials our
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
citizens elect
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
it ports forth the notion
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
that enjoyment property is all that
 
05:01:35.520 --> 05:01:37.110 align:start position:0%
that enjoyment property is all that
matters

05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
matters
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
public health measures
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
regulations to design protect citizens
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
and help them thrive those are trivial
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
and in fact they should be prohibited
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
undermines the essence of rsa 4717
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
which empowers local elected officials
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
to protect the people they serve
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
and not just their property
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it subverts existing law further
 
05:02:09.750 --> 05:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
by preventing city councils from
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
carrying out the duties they are sworn
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
to perform
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
that all of us in this chamber are very
 
05:02:19.280 --> 05:02:20.708 align:start position:0%
that all of us in this chamber are very
wise

05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
wise
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
but are we better equipped to know at
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
what citizens in the 13 cities across
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
our state want
 
05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
i really don't think so
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that is why they chose some of us to
 
05:02:37.110 --> 05:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
serve at the state level
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
while expecting the counselors they
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
elected locally to understand their
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
needs and ensure their safety
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote itl yet again on this
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
newest version of state house overreach
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%

05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
city councils may pass
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
it inserts a definition about public
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
health nuisances into the statute to
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
clear up vagaries
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
it only pertains to one sentence in the
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous section about city council
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
bylaws not the whole chapter
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
the definition was developed by the new
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire public health nuisance task
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
force to address this sometimes
 
05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
confusing subject matter
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
it leaves intact the broad authority
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
that city councils have enjoyed to make
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
local issue bylaws
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
it covers everything from septic codes
 
05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
to mosquito control
 
05:04:06.560 --> 05:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
to mosquito control
everything

05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is a local issue
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
but it ensures that broader public
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
will be addressed by the state

thank you mr speaker
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
creates government overreach by limiting
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
the local control so crucial to each and
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
every city council and if mr speaker i
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
know that the current statutory language
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
make any bylaws or ordinance which may
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
seem for the well-being of the city
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
has served our cities well
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
limiting language to be amended would
 
05:05:27.670 --> 05:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
limit the statute to the enjoyment of
 
05:05:27.680 --> 05:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
limit the statute to the enjoyment of
property

05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that the
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
current statute ensures that local
 
05:05:34.230 --> 05:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
elected officials in our cities are
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
empowered to protect
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
all the people that they serve and not

councils make laws
 
05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%

confusing patchwork of differing laws
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%

under which the housing appeals board

05:09:48.868 --> 05:09:48.878 align:start position:0%

and i am
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
asking you
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
not to support the committee report
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
because the housing appeals board has
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
only been in operation for about two
 
05:10:00.240 --> 05:10:01.270 align:start position:0%
only been in operation for about two
years

05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so far
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's working okay
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is say that
 
05:10:08.638 --> 05:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is say that
some

05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:10:09.840 --> 05:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
some
local

05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
land some local boards
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
and elected officials
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
when you're when the housing appeals
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
board is looking at whether to
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
approve or not approve an appeal
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
and while it seems sensible that maybe
 
05:10:29.360 --> 05:10:30.470 align:start position:0%
and while it seems sensible that maybe
only

05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
the planning board and the zba should be
 
05:10:34.550 --> 05:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
05:10:34.560 --> 05:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
part of that
since

05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
boards have to do with
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
whether roads are open and closed and
 
05:10:40.798 --> 05:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
whether roads are open and closed and
what

05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
classification roads have and road
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
classification does in fact affect how
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
land use can be done
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i would respectfully ask you for that
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
reason to vote against the ought to pass
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that all of the boards and elected
 
05:11:03.120 --> 05:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
so that all of the boards and elected
officials

05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:11:06.550 --> 05:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
that and appointed officials that have
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
to do with decisions
 
05:11:12.150 --> 05:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
concerning land use may continue
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be part of the housing appeals board
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
process thank you chair reckon as
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
as you've heard this bill relates to the
 
05:11:30.550 --> 05:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board h.a.b the have
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
board it was formed sort of like the
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals it's a
 
05:11:38.230 --> 05:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
three-person board appointed supposed to
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
be people of expertise in the area and
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's to provide an avenue for appeal
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
from local decisions
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
this board is a lesson in legislative
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
experience much like committees getting
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
a bill and having it be in their
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the h.a.b board was
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
actually created in 2019
 
05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
in what some people referred to as the
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill
 
05:12:04.798 --> 05:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill
hb2

05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that has tried to meander
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
its way through the legislative process
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
one body to the other body to a
 
05:12:18.070 --> 05:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
signature but didn't quite make it
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
and sort of like the christmas tree that
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
has unexpected presence under it it
 
05:12:23.920 --> 05:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
has unexpected presence under it it
reappeared

05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
reappeared
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
in the how in the hb2 was a bill that
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately was passed without following
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
what some argue is the typical
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
as stated this board is relatively new
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
but i would suggest to you that waiting
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
for something we create to go bad to fix
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
it is not a reason to not address it
 
05:12:45.200 --> 05:12:46.948 align:start position:0%
it is not a reason to not address it
today

05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
since the housing appeals board was
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
formed there have actually been 15 at
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
least at the time the committee
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
considered it 15 bills that were
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
considered by this which are appeals
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
from your local boards and
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
as also suggested it has included an
 
05:13:06.628 --> 05:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
appeal from the board of selectmen even
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
though an appeal from the board of
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
selectmen was not ever listed
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the jurisdiction of this board when
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bill was adopted
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
what was listed in the jurisdiction of
 
05:13:18.160 --> 05:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
what was listed in the jurisdiction of
bills

05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
of for the board when this was adopted
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
was a non-exclusive list
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
of things that do not include
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
development of land
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
so what it is it was authorized by
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
statute to do was to hear appeals of
 
05:13:38.550 --> 05:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
fines ordinances
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
and things that were never
 
05:13:43.030 --> 05:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
expressed as the purpose of the housing
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
appeals board
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
is put the housing appeals board in a
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
position where its authority is clearly
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
delineated to those decisions in your
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
localities that deal with the approval
 
05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
of development of land that's what it
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
was intended to do and i ask that you
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
approve the bill so it is what it can
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
motion before is the majority report of
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%

considered the same report the same the
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
pass senator patricia keel for the
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee having

considered the same being unable to
 
05:14:58.150 --> 05:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
05:15:00.310 --> 05:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
following resolution that it isn't
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate president richard
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
tripp from the minority of the committee
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
 
05:15:47.750 --> 05:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker excuse me
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose the passage of house
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill 1342.
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes the people we elect to our
 
05:15:56.550 --> 05:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
governing boards get impressed
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
with all the demands of government
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
when most of the voices they hear
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
they are listening to are all saying
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
spend spend spend
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
so we allowed the taxpayers to vote in
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
spending caps
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
a landmark decision on manchester
 
05:16:13.510 --> 05:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
spending led to the passage of a 2011
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
law to put in law guidance on spending
 
05:16:18.868 --> 05:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
caps that had been passed locally
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the law stated and i quote
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
all town or city charters which have
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
been adopted revised or amended to
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
include a tax or spending cap of any
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
kind and all charter commissions which
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
have been properly established and
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
elected all elections properly held in
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
all actions properly taken related to
 
05:16:38.788 --> 05:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
the tax or spending cap and such
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
charters are hereby endorsed ratified
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
validated and legalized and are fully
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
enforceable without regard to whether
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
such entities or actions were authorized
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
by law at the time they were established
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
or taken
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
when enacted some of the spending caps
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
included an override clause but
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
not all of them did
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
so those are left without that control
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
thus we see
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
house bill 1342
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
it was filed to benefit nashua
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
because when their spending cap was
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
passed there was no section to provide
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
for a super majority override
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
override the nashua budget now it would
 
05:17:22.948 --> 05:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
take a charter commission to place the
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
override language therein
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
a charter commission by the legal
 
05:17:26.638 --> 05:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
a charter commission by the legal
procedure

05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
takes about two years
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
nashua wants their representatives to
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
pass this law so they can do it in less
 
05:17:33.680 --> 05:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
pass this law so they can do it in less
time

05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:17:36.470 --> 05:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
although many of the municipal and
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
county government
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee seem to sympathize with that
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
intent this bill before us has
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as it was
 
05:17:45.200 --> 05:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as it was
written

05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
i see that it eliminates provisions in
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
an earlier law that would have protected
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
previous actions it eliminates some of
 
05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
the language in the paragraph i just
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
read in quotation marks
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
it would remove the necessity for an
 
05:17:58.638 --> 05:17:59.670 align:start position:0%
it would remove the necessity for an
annual

05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
annual
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
municipal budget super majority vote in
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
order to exclude interest and principle
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
on municipal bonded debt or capital
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
expenditure to outside the limit of the
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
capped budget it would remove the
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
necessity of an annual municipal budget
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
super majority vote in order for an
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
ordinance or accounting practice to
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
redistribute budget items from within
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
the limits of the cap budget most
 
05:18:24.080 --> 05:18:25.350 align:start position:0%
the limits of the cap budget most
importantly

05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would eliminate the crucial
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
provisions signed into law just last
 
05:18:30.080 --> 05:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
provisions signed into law just last
year

05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
that grandfather tax and spending caps
 
05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
enacted before july 5th 2011
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
that would be eliminated thus
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing municipal charter tax and
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
spending caps across the state
 
05:18:46.708 --> 05:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
could affect your municipal budget while
 
05:18:51.910 --> 05:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
narrowly focusing on nashua's problem to
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
fix one problem we should not jeopardize
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
the situation of perhaps many other
 
05:18:59.910 --> 05:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
places this bill has flaws rather than
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
having to come back next time to fix
 
05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
them let's just reverse this octopass
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
and make the bill inexpedient to
 
05:19:07.040 --> 05:19:08.628 align:start position:0%
and make the bill inexpedient to
legislate

05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
chair representatives representative
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker happy st patrick's
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%

1342
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and it is kind of in an indirect way a
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to senate bill 52
 
05:19:38.718 --> 05:19:39.750 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to senate bill 52
if

05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the representative if i listen to his
 
05:19:42.080 --> 05:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
the representative if i listen to his
debate

05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
debate
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
and he says well how things came in well
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
52 instead of taking the freight
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
elevator it definitely took the express
 
05:19:52.560 --> 05:19:54.150 align:start position:0%
elevator it definitely took the express
elevator

05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
elevator
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay the right way to have done this
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
was to have something brought up as on a
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
referendum within the city budget as
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
a city ballot but that wasn't done
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
instead it came in via a back door
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
with a senator
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
and thus here we are so whenever
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
anything comes in the back door
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
does it really
 
05:20:20.708 --> 05:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
solve a hundred percent of the problem
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
the answer is usually not
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
okay so in this particular case
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
nashua yes is seeking resolve now i
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
understand and i don't want you some of
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
my good friends and colleagues to be
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
rolling your eyes sort of like an old
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
episode of the brady bunch where jan
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
goes up and says masha masha maja
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
and here's ob down at duelgo in nashua
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
but this is a truly legitimate problem
 
05:20:55.510 --> 05:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of nashua
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
what's at hand here if there is some
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
dire emergency
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
nashville may need a mechanism
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
to override the cap on a particular
 
05:21:07.680 --> 05:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
to override the cap on a particular
issue

05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
so i arise today to urge you
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to say in our
 
05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
existing charter there is our it is
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
already codified
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we do have a super majority it's in
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
the charter
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i rise today to urge you to support
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
1342 with a positive recommendation of
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
what to pass
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the citizens of
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
nashua the same fiscal rights
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by many of your same communities
 
05:21:40.948 --> 05:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
if you have in your community a spending
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
cap you probably do have some overripe
 
05:21:45.670 --> 05:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
vision in it
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
all nashville wants to do in this
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
particular bill is to be treated fairly
 
05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
you remember
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
i previously came last year and came
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
before you on senate bill 52 which was
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussed by this body at that time i
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
spoke 52 was flawed and created problems
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
again as i reiterated earlier
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
having this without an override is one
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the problems
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
this does not harm senate bill 52
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact it enhances it
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
by enhancing it
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
it will basically allow the override
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
position now how do we get here from
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
nashua this was tried and true the
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruled down the spending
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
cap till we can have the override
 
05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
position put into it
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
why is this override provision needed
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
well many of you will they'll wear two
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
hats like i do i'm uh alderman in the
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
city now sure and maybe some of you
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
besides being the same rep are in the
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
same boat
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know that sometimes murphy speaking
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the same party say murphy's law what
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
can go wrong will
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
maybe a wall might fall on your fire
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
truck or something might happen and at
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
times you might need a remedy to go
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
above the cap
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
so by allowing nashua to have this will
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
allow them to address those particular
 
05:23:14.558 --> 05:23:16.548 align:start position:0%
allow them to address those particular
issues

05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
in essence senate house bill 1342 does
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
not in any form like they say try to
 
05:23:22.878 --> 05:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
not in any form like they say try to
harm

05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
harm
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52.
 
05:23:28.470 --> 05:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
there is further president on this and i
 
05:23:32.670 --> 05:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
want to bring up that
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
rsa49c semicolon 33
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
the letter i
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
parentheses d
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to bore you
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
but i'll limit on the annual spending
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
increases that increases the amount
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
raised by taxes on the city budget
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
adopted pursuant to rsa 49 dash c23
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
such a cap shall provide for an override
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
threshold on a vote to exceed the normal
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
annual increase which shall be a
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
supermajority as determined by the
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
charter a tax cap in the provision of a
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
city charter may provide for
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
specific conclusions so i don't think
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
you want me to go on with the whole
 
05:24:15.520 --> 05:24:16.548 align:start position:0%
you want me to go on with the whole
thing

05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
but i think you can believe me on
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what i say it's right in near
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking you
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit friendly nashua has a
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of an issue i know it's the
 
05:24:30.480 --> 05:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
little bit of an issue i know it's the
only

05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're the only city or town
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
that has this particular issue
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking for your grace
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you will come up and support the
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
citizens of nashua in uh by
 
05:24:49.110 --> 05:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
passing house bill 1342
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
and to allow the right that evidently
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
was wrong to allow the city of nashville
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
which was a stand-alone municipality
 
05:24:58.470 --> 05:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
with no override provision
 
05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
and to become part of it just like
 
05:25:02.788 --> 05:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
manchester which is similar in size to
 
05:25:02.798 --> 05:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
manchester which is similar in size to
us

05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
and they have the override as well
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking for fair treatment thank
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%

agree with the majority report with the
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolve that it is
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
patricia cleave for the minority of the

clee is recognized to speak against the

05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:35:59.830 --> 05:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues i have to admit as a person
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
who's worked with the military veterans
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
since i was 18 years old who's worked
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
with department of defense department of
 
05:36:09.190 --> 05:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
for me to speak against anything that
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
would limit any person from a military
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
background veteran or active duty
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
getting any extra benefit puts a dagger
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
into my heart
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
but the truth is we have to look at the
 
05:36:22.868 --> 05:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
big picture
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
and we have to be honest that in the end
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is a tax shifting bill
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
it shifts the tax burden from one group
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
of individuals to another group of
 
05:36:32.240 --> 05:36:33.510 align:start position:0%
of individuals to another group of
individuals

05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
the broadened definition will only add
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
more to the pool who qualify for the
 
05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
veterans credits and exemptions
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
i agree we should do everything that we
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
can to take to thank those
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
that have and are serving our country in
 
05:36:49.590 --> 05:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
keeping us safe but doing so at the
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
expense of others doesn't make us the
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
good guys
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
while serving on state federal relations
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
and veterans affairs there were a number
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
of bills brought to create equity
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
between title 38 veterans benefits us
 
05:37:05.110 --> 05:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
code 101 definitions
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
often referred to as usc 101
 
05:37:09.990 --> 05:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
meaning the definitions
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
of veterans and what is a veteran as
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
well as what is active duty as per usc
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
101 a veteran by definition is a person
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
who served
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
in the active military naval or air
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
service and who was discharged or
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
released there from
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
under conditions other than dishonorable
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the key word here is served not serving
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
as i already stated but bears repeating
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to change the definition
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of credits and
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions we're adding to the pool of
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
those who qualify for these credits and
 
05:37:45.280 --> 05:37:46.390 align:start position:0%
those who qualify for these credits and
exemptions

05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
in 2020 based on the department of
 
05:37:49.120 --> 05:37:50.150 align:start position:0%
in 2020 based on the department of

05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
reports the the state of new hampshire
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%

05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
veterans and or families
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
those who do not qualify for these
 
05:38:17.670 --> 05:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions and credits share in what is
 
05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
often referred to as lost taxes
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
meaning their taxes go up to cover these
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
lost taxes
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the veterans tax
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
credit exemption program is enabling
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
and will remain that way even if this
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
passes but
 
05:38:35.670 --> 05:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
and this is a big but
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
when each municipality designed their
 
05:38:40.948 --> 05:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
program they based it on what they felt
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
their residents could or would bear
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
someone else chose not to grant any
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
veterans credits exemptions and others
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
have given
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
high amounts and others not quite so
 
05:38:51.760 --> 05:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
high amounts and others not quite so
much

05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
i stated that in 2020 in the state of
 
05:38:56.470 --> 05:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipalities granted
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
almost 32 million in tax relief just to
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
veterans and their families
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
these are small communities i'm sorry
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are small communities who don't
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
grant any
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
and some that grant as little as an
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
overall amount of only fifty dollars and
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
then there are those larger communities
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
cited in the minority report they
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
granted credits exemptions in excess of
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
communities such as those in the area of
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
peace and those communities that border
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
the state to our south will have the
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
largest impact
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
based on 2020 figures of active duty and
 
05:39:34.470 --> 05:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
reservists here in new hampshire there's
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
potential an increase of the pool by an
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
additional 10 percent who will qualify
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
again shifting the burden to other
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
property owners who do not qualify
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
in the end isn't a new tax shift of any
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
form an increase in taxes
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
and isn't the state of new hampshire all
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
about little to no taxes
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to throw around the cliche
 
05:39:59.830 --> 05:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is often spoken in this chamber
 
05:40:02.150 --> 05:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
relative to taxes but i know that i
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
can't ask those already struggling in my
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
city to pick up an additional burden can
 
05:40:07.680 --> 05:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
city to pick up an additional burden can
you

05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
the only way to eliminate that burden
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be to either one
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
lessen the amount granted for a credit
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
or two completely the eliminate the
 
05:40:19.510 --> 05:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
credit exemption in that community
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
personally i don't see the latter
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
happening but i do believe it's
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
conceivable for larger communities to
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
reduce what they currently grant
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
if that happens once again we are
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax burden of those
 
05:40:31.760 --> 05:40:32.948 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax burden of those
veterans

05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
who are getting the credit slash
 
05:40:34.878 --> 05:40:36.230 align:start position:0%
who are getting the credit slash
exemptions

05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is a very hard catch 22 in that
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will hurt one
 
05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
group or another or multiple groups
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
this is not a political fight
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
rather it's a fight to not burden those
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
already held down by taxes just to say
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
look how we helped one very important
 
05:40:55.120 --> 05:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
look how we helped one very important
population

05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
i have to ask
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
can we do so on the backs of the
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
remaining property owners
 
05:41:03.030 --> 05:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to repeat something to
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
help make it clear so that we all
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
understand the situation you'll hear
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
from others that veterans tax credit is
 
05:41:11.670 --> 05:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
enabling and yes it is
 
05:41:11.680 --> 05:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
enabling and yes it is
however

05:41:13.270 --> 05:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
if you implement it or have done so you
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
must do so in its entirety
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
you can't say this group or that group
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
you have to do it all exactly as the
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
legislation says
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
you can set the amount that you give as
 
05:41:28.868 --> 05:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
long as you stay within the minimum and
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
maximum set by this very body
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
this means that some municipalities have
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
exemptions while others have a credit as
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
low as the minimum of fifty dollars and
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
others as high as the maximum of seven
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars
 
05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
some may say this doesn't cost the state
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the municipality a single dime
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're one hundred percent right it
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a toll on either budget
 
05:41:52.558 --> 05:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a toll on either budget
however

05:41:53.590 --> 05:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
it does hit the wallets of those
 
05:41:58.948 --> 05:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
who this does not apply to
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
as my mom taught me
 
05:42:02.708 --> 05:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
stealing from peter to pay paul
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
and patting ourselves on the back
 
05:42:06.310 --> 05:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
because we helped veterans doesn't make
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
us better people
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
let's continue to use the definition
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
provided by title 38 usc 101 relative to
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
veterans as those who have served and
 
05:42:17.990 --> 05:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
not broadened the definition here
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
those that argue in favor of this bill
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
may say this is just a housekeeping bill
 
05:42:24.390 --> 05:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
to bring one state statute into the
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
other in line with another
 
05:42:28.470 --> 05:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
while there may be another new hampshire
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
statute that defines a veteran to
 
05:42:33.270 --> 05:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
include active duty etc perhaps we need
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
to examine why
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
and if necessary bring that statute into
 
05:42:37.440 --> 05:42:38.628 align:start position:0%
and if necessary bring that statute into
alignment

05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the veterans benefit title 38 usc
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
101's definition of a veteran as a
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
person who served and not serving
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
remember unintended consequences a
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
broadened definition for a veteran that
 
05:42:52.868 --> 05:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
puts us in conflict with the federal
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran only puts a
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
burden on those pools of property owners
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
who don't qualify
 
05:43:01.350 --> 05:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
this body does everything that we can to
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
keep taxes low and we do that do what we
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
can to maintain equity throughout our
 
05:43:06.480 --> 05:43:07.430 align:start position:0%
can to maintain equity throughout our
state

05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is a simple tax shift to those who
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't qualify
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will join me in over
 
05:43:15.990 --> 05:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
overturning the ought to pass of this
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
tax shifting bill so that another motion
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
can be made and thank you so much for
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
the member from brookline representative
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
power is recognized to speak in favor of
 
05:43:40.390 --> 05:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise in support of the
 
05:43:46.470 --> 05:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of ought to
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
pass on house bill
 
05:43:48.360 --> 05:43:50.070 align:start position:0%
pass on house bill
1667.

05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
1667.
 
05:43:54.070 --> 05:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
in 1871 after the civil civil war the
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
first veterans tax credit was signed
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
into law in new hampshire
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
over the past 150 years a number of
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
statutory changes have been made to
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
include the latest armed conflicts
 
05:44:10.230 --> 05:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of a veteran
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
and to include certain certain national
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
guardsmen and reservists
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law clearly defines a
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
veteran as any person who has served in
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
the armed forces for more than four
 
05:44:26.708 --> 05:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
years and
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
continues to serve or
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
who has been honorably discharged or has
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
received an uncharacterized discharge
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
based on a service-connected injury
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
illness or disability
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
due to the discrepancy between this
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran and the veterans
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
tax credit statutes
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
some military veterans are wrongly
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
excluded from receiving any of the
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
and ironically the all veterans tax
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
credit does not include all veterans
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
recognized under new hampshire law
 
05:45:10.230 --> 05:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1667
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
addresses these inconsistencies
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
first this bill amends the language in
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
statutes to include
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
those veterans still serving
 
05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the statutory definition
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
of a veteran
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
and second
 
05:45:32.470 --> 05:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill removes the title 10 prefix
 
05:45:36.070 --> 05:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
from the veterans tax credits language
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
so that title 10
 
05:45:42.548 --> 05:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
title 32 and title 14 active service
 
05:45:46.470 --> 05:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
all qualify for the 90-day requirement
 
05:45:46.480 --> 05:45:47.670 align:start position:0%
all qualify for the 90-day requirement
lastly

05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
it is important to note
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
that less than half a percent
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
of americans currently serve in our
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
armed forces
 
05:45:57.280 --> 05:45:58.470 align:start position:0%
armed forces
therefore

05:45:58.470 --> 05:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:46:00.788 --> 05:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
the claim that these changes will create
 
05:46:05.190 --> 05:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
an undue tax burden is over exaggerated
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the dollar amount that
 
05:46:10.470 --> 05:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
my colleague quoted
 
05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:14.160 --> 05:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
pertains

05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
pertains
 
05:46:20.470 --> 05:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
a large percentage to disabled veterans
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies that all veterans of
 
05:46:27.910 --> 05:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
the united states armed forces who
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
served in any active duty status
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of the title
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
or the branch of military that they
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
served in as well as those who continue
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
05:46:43.750 --> 05:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for the veterans tax credits
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i urge my fellow
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of ought to
 
05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
05:49:29.590 --> 05:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the expanded
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran proposed in this
 
05:49:32.160 --> 05:49:33.110 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran proposed in this
bill

05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the definition of
 
05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
veterans under federal law
 
05:49:39.510 --> 05:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know that new hampshire towns
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
and cities already provide generous
 
05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
support to veterans their spouses and
 
05:49:44.718 --> 05:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
support to veterans their spouses and
children

05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%

05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
granting more than 32 million dollars in
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
2020 alone
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill will shift tax burdens
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
from one group to another
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
something we really don't want to do
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
resulting in significant property tax
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
increases for those who do not qualify
 
05:50:08.470 --> 05:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to
 
05:50:10.470 --> 05:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
defeat the majorities ought to pass
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that another motion
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
can be made thank you mr speaker
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is recognized for
 
05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
if if i know from my 33 years of serving
 
05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
in all components of the army
 
05:50:30.878 --> 05:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
in all components of the army
that

05:50:32.470 --> 05:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
my 10 years of active duty
 
05:50:37.750 --> 05:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
was spent on hardship tours
 
05:50:42.390 --> 05:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
in monterey california san antonio texas
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the university of southern california
 
05:50:48.070 --> 05:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
and seoul korea
 
05:50:48.080 --> 05:50:49.030 align:start position:0%
and seoul korea
but

05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
that my two tours
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
of being called recalled to active duty
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
as a guardsman or a res or a reservist i
 
05:51:00.070 --> 05:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
i deployed to afghanistan
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and got shot at four times
 
05:51:09.270 --> 05:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
i never got shot at on active duty
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so as we look dispassionately
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
05:51:17.350 --> 05:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
that as we look dispassionately at these
 
05:51:17.360 --> 05:51:19.350 align:start position:0%
that as we look dispassionately at these
definitions

05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
the way the current
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
tax code is written
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
discriminates against the guardsmen and
 
05:51:29.750 --> 05:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the reservists
 
05:51:29.760 --> 05:51:30.948 align:start position:0%
the reservists
who

05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
after 20 years of a land war
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the middle east
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
have probably seen as much combat duty
 
05:51:42.548 --> 05:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
as most active duty people
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
so if i knew
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't about money because if
 
05:51:48.470 --> 05:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's about money we can reduce the money
 
05:51:48.480 --> 05:51:49.590 align:start position:0%
it's about money we can reduce the money
later

05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
later

members who support and expedient to
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislate believe this bill is premature
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new hampshire
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
d.o.t was authorized to conduct a
 
06:03:08.948 --> 06:03:08.958 align:start position:0%

if this bill passes could potentially
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
leave us on the hook for an unknown sum
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
and if i know that when completed next
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
year the project development will give
 
06:03:29.510 --> 06:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature a clearer picture of the
 
06:03:31.590 --> 06:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
total costs in the legislature's
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
legislators in the next term can debate
 
06:03:37.030 --> 06:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
those costs on and where the funding
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
should or should not come from
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that manchester is
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
the economic driver of the state and
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
that this project will come right
 
06:03:47.190 --> 06:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
through my district of manchester's ward
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
9 bringing with it the opportunities of
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
private public partnerships and
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
boundless new business ventures for
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
residents of manchester nashua bedford
 
06:03:57.750 --> 06:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
and countless other surrounding
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities then would i now press the
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
green button to table this premature
 
06:04:02.000 --> 06:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
green button to table this premature
legislation

06:04:06.470 --> 06:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative graham is recognized for
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
 
06:04:12.230 --> 06:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
speaker mr speaker if i've learned
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
anything of the two decades up here that
 
06:04:16.470 --> 06:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's nice to listen to the
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
opposition before you vote against their
 
06:04:18.958 --> 06:04:20.230 align:start position:0%
opposition before you vote against their
position

06:04:20.230 --> 06:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:04:20.240 --> 06:04:21.190 align:start position:0%
position
and

06:04:21.190 --> 06:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that the debate on this bill
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
will be one-on-one and very short
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that you should listen to both sides
 
06:04:30.390 --> 06:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
since it is without recommendation
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
and if i truly believe that the ought to
 
06:04:36.070 --> 06:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
pass position will prevail in this body
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
when i now press the red button and keep
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
this off of the table thank you mr
 
06:04:41.040 --> 06:04:44.070 align:start position:0%

06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
the question is whether the lay house
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill 1432 on the table this is a roll
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%

06:04:51.990 --> 06:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
your house will be in order if you're in
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
favor you'll press the green button if
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
you're opposed you'll press the red
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
button voting stations are open for 30
 
06:04:56.558 --> 06:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
button voting stations are open for 30
seconds

06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%

06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
of all members president an opportunity
 
06:06:02.948 --> 06:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
152 in the affirmative 182 and the
 
06:06:10.708 --> 06:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
negative the motion fails
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're back to the motion of ought to
 
06:06:12.160 --> 06:06:13.830 align:start position:0%
we're back to the motion of ought to
pass

06:06:13.830 --> 06:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:06:15.510 --> 06:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
the member from nashua representative
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
jack is recognized to speak against the
 
06:06:17.280 --> 06:06:26.708 align:start position:0%
jack is recognized to speak against the
motion

06:06:26.708 --> 06:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:28.390 --> 06:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:06:30.150 --> 06:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to the ought to
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
pass motion
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
the federal transit administration has
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
an established process that we are
 
06:06:37.750 --> 06:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
following step one is the alternatives
 
06:06:40.868 --> 06:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
analysis that was completed in 2014.
 
06:06:43.270 --> 06:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
it evaluated seven bus and rail
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
alternatives including doing nothing to
 
06:06:47.750 --> 06:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
develop ridership estimates economic
 
06:06:50.310 --> 06:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
benefit estimates and cost estimates the
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
best cost benefit was achieved by
 
06:06:54.788 --> 06:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
extension of the mbta lowell line to
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
manchester on the existing freight line
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
step two is the project development
 
06:07:03.910 --> 06:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
phase that was funded in 2019 by sb 241
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
an identical language in that year's
 
06:07:07.510 --> 06:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
budget hb4
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
this phase does enough engineering to
 
06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
determine a firm project cost
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
completes environmental permitting and
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
produces a financial plan
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
to suggest how capital and operating
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
costs could be covered it is on track to
 
06:07:22.470 --> 06:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
be completed later this year
 
06:07:24.470 --> 06:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the source of funds is federal transit
 
06:07:26.708 --> 06:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
administration funds already in the
 
06:07:28.470 --> 06:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
state's possession matched with toll
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
credits it is important to note this
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
pool of money can only be spent on
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
transit and only in the boston urbanized
 
06:07:37.830 --> 06:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
area the state receives a new allocation
 
06:07:40.470 --> 06:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
every year and using this funding is not
 
06:07:42.628 --> 06:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
starving any other project
 
06:07:44.830 --> 06:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
with these two steps complete a future
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
legislature could decide to apply for a
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
competitive construction grant under the
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
new starts program after what i am sure
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
would be a full and vigorous debate on
 
06:07:56.470 --> 06:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the financial plan
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in what we have done so far
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
obligates the state to proceed to
 
06:08:02.548 --> 06:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
construction or to repay any of the
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds that have been used
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
amtrak operates the downeaster from
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
boston into maine and the vermonter that
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
crosses into new hampshire to make a
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
stop in claremont these are not using
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
state funds at this time but they may
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
may wish to in the future
 
06:08:20.390 --> 06:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
knowing all of this we can see that the
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing to advance the
 
06:08:24.548 --> 06:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
intention to stop the capital corridor
 
06:08:27.190 --> 06:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
project since no state funds are being
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
used there is strong public support for
 
06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
commuter rail i looked at a poll over
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
the weekend that was over 70 percent in
 
06:08:34.480 --> 06:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
the weekend that was over 70 percent in
support

06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
not having rail makes it more difficult
 
06:08:40.948 --> 06:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
for employers to attract workers some of
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
those workers might be
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrency developers that we
 
06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
heard about on tuesday
 
06:08:48.628 --> 06:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would send a terrible
 
06:08:49.990 --> 06:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
message about how willing the
 
06:08:52.788 --> 06:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
legislature is to listen to its citizens
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
and businesses
 
06:08:56.470 --> 06:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
we avoid appropriating funds outside of
 
06:08:58.868 --> 06:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle and it is equally wrong
 
06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill that would restrict the
 
06:09:03.510 --> 06:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
use of funds outside of the budget cycle
 
06:09:05.190 --> 06:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
i encourage members to join me in
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button it is
 
06:09:08.230 --> 06:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
hang on
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's super noisy in here and can
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:15.670 --> 06:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
sorry about that please continue
 
06:09:17.430 --> 06:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
i encourage members to join me in
 
06:09:19.030 --> 06:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button to defeat the
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion so another motion
 
06:09:25.990 --> 06:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're not too comfy out
 
06:09:31.910 --> 06:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the member from bedford representative
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
graham is recognized to speak in favor
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the motion
 
06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
he's the last speaker
 
06:09:40.390 --> 06:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'd be shocked if this was
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
they've already asked for division vote
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
on this so members should start
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
migrating back
 
06:09:50.070 --> 06:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
quietly please um thank you mr speaker
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the ought to pass
 
06:09:52.798 --> 06:09:53.750 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the ought to pass
motion

06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:09:55.230 --> 06:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
on h.b
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
1432. let's talk about this for a little
 
06:09:58.160 --> 06:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
1432. let's talk about this for a little
bit

06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
bit
 
06:10:02.070 --> 06:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
it is not whether or not passenger rail
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
is going to come to new hampshire
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
that is a policy decision for another
 
06:10:06.878 --> 06:10:08.390 align:start position:0%
that is a policy decision for another
day

06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
it is not about
 
06:10:12.628 --> 06:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
private public partnerships with the
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions of the state that
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
is their decision to make in the future
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
it is also unfortunately
 
06:10:24.150 --> 06:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
not about ancillary costs to
 
06:10:24.160 --> 06:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
not about ancillary costs to
municipalities

06:10:25.750 --> 06:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
in any rail corridor
 
06:10:30.310 --> 06:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
and there will be some if this is ever
 
06:10:30.320 --> 06:10:32.548 align:start position:0%
and there will be some if this is ever
built

06:10:32.548 --> 06:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
built
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
it is not about stopping the ongoing
 
06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
project development plan for the capital

that is being done with federal monies
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
and is well underway with a report date
 
06:10:48.628 --> 06:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
for that

study in early 2023
 
06:10:55.030 --> 06:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have some preliminary reports from it
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
but nothing that that really indicates
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost
 
06:11:00.840 --> 06:11:02.390 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost
this

06:11:02.390 --> 06:11:02.400 align:start position:0%

report
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
will cover cons what it costs for
 
06:11:05.760 --> 06:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
will cover cons what it costs for

whatever else is needed
 
06:11:16.628 --> 06:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
to include if we have to
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
put down

new rail or anything else
 
06:11:22.628 --> 06:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
and it will also address funding sources
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
to pay for all of this which will in
 
06:11:28.230 --> 06:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
probability taking in total be in the
 
06:11:30.788 --> 06:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
what it is is a statement that the state
 
06:11:36.788 --> 06:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
will not
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
be used as the piggy bank for passenger
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
rail service
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is clearly tell

those making the recommendations on
 
06:11:50.240 --> 06:11:51.270 align:start position:0%

06:11:51.270 --> 06:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
will not be providing the funds
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
it will also clearly
 
06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
make clear
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
to the department of transportation
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%

06:12:12.230 --> 06:12:12.240 align:start position:0%

members

06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
if i
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
know according to a 2019
 
06:15:11.430 --> 06:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
poll conducted by a new hampshire
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
business publication that 75 percent of
 
06:15:18.868 --> 06:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
our state's residents support bringing
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
passenger rail to southern new hampshire
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and if i believe this bill is premature
 
06:15:27.830 --> 06:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
because now the project development
 
06:15:30.230 --> 06:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
phase of the proposed capital corridor
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
rail line is being done using federal
 
06:15:33.760 --> 06:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
rail line is being done using federal
funds

06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
and in in a phase that will be complete
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be completed in 2023
 
06:15:44.788 --> 06:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
then the next term those of us who
 
06:15:46.628 --> 06:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
return next term
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
will have a chance to debate how we pay
 
06:15:52.868 --> 06:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
for this project which may or may not
 
06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
include state funds
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
that if let's say this bill were to pass
 
06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
and become law
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
a future legislature could easily repeal
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
it next term or later because
 
06:16:09.680 --> 06:16:10.868 align:start position:0%
it next term or later because
no

06:16:10.868 --> 06:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:16:14.470 --> 06:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
current legislature can ever bind future
 
06:16:17.910 --> 06:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislatures in this or other policy
 
06:16:21.430 --> 06:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
matters would i now press the red button
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
and oppose the ought to pass
 
06:16:27.750 --> 06:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.430 --> 06:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey is recognized

and
 
06:16:50.628 --> 06:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
i know nothing in this bill prohibits
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision of the state
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%

miles of state roadway back to the town
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
of merrimack currently known as

continental boulevard

we don't want it
 
06:21:04.230 --> 06:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
this road came about in 1993 when the
 
06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
d.o.t acquired lands through eminent
 
06:21:09.030 --> 06:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
domain proceedings to build the road
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack back then argued
 
06:21:12.788 --> 06:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
against eminent domain proceedings for
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard but the d.o.t
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
prevailed arguing that public necessity
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the use of private property for this
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
stretch of road was needed by the public
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
in the region for the greater good
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
some thirty odd years later continental
 
06:21:28.948 --> 06:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
boulevard continues to serve
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
as a primary arterial connection for
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
route 101a running west to east from
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
milford to nashua
 
06:21:38.070 --> 06:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
to the fever turnpike at exits 10-11 and
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
daniel webster highway us-3
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
this connection carries more than 17 000
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles per day many of which are from
 
06:21:46.948 --> 06:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
more than 10 000 of those vehicles can
 
06:21:50.390 --> 06:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
be found in traffic counts along
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
industrial drive and continental
 
06:21:51.760 --> 06:21:52.948 align:start position:0%

boulevard

06:21:52.948 --> 06:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
the traffic volumes on the state section
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
of continental boulevard exceed those of
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
any merrimack public road
 
06:22:00.788 --> 06:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
including the urban compact section of
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
daniel webster highway that carries a
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
traffic volume of 14 550 cars daily
 
06:22:09.190 --> 06:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the demand for a high level of service
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
will be constant as this roadway remains
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
a critical part of the state's
 
06:22:14.788 --> 06:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as a primary artery
 
06:22:16.948 --> 06:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
between the major east-west
 
06:22:18.788 --> 06:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
and north-south route in southern new
 
06:22:20.708 --> 06:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire region
 
06:22:22.150 --> 06:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
now the argument is being made that the
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
stretch of roadway is no longer
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
needed as a public necessity to the
 
06:22:26.160 --> 06:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
needed as a public necessity to the
state

06:22:27.350 --> 06:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
d.o.t seeks to abdicate its ownership
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
from a roadway it richly wanted back in
 
06:22:31.440 --> 06:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
from a roadway it richly wanted back in
1993.

06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
1993.
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
the town's absorption of this roadway to
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
our town's budget is an additional 200
 
06:22:40.468 --> 06:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
000 annually with potential long-term
 
06:22:42.628 --> 06:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
capital costs exceeding 2.5 million
 
06:22:44.548 --> 06:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
dollars over the next 20 years
 
06:22:46.708 --> 06:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
and that's infrastructure not including
 
06:22:48.788 --> 06:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
staffing equipment and other ancillary
 
06:22:50.390 --> 06:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
components necessary to maintain the
 
06:22:50.400 --> 06:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
components necessary to maintain the
roadway

06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
06:22:53.430 --> 06:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
furthermore the road
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
the town also gets the roadway in its
 
06:22:57.990 --> 06:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
supporting infrastructure
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
as is
 
06:23:01.350 --> 06:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
no caveat emptor
 
06:23:03.190 --> 06:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
just the town being gifted a piece of
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that the town didn't want
 
06:23:09.190 --> 06:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
in 1993 and still doesn't want today
 
06:23:11.030 --> 06:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
as you deliberate this amendment please
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
consider that this application of
 
06:23:14.390 --> 06:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
content at the boulevard by the d.o.t to
 
06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack
 
06:23:18.150 --> 06:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
could also happen in your community
 
06:23:20.310 --> 06:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me then please press
 
06:23:21.670 --> 06:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
the green button
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the d.o.t remains
 
06:23:25.830 --> 06:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
committed and engaged to maintain the
 
06:23:27.670 --> 06:23:27.680 align:start position:0%

06:24:16.548 --> 06:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
cost the town of merrimack to repave the
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%

i thank the gentlelady for the question

potentially for paving the search of
 
06:24:29.670 --> 06:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
roadway is 200 000. what i can know that
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
was brought up in testimony in committee
 
06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
was that the d.o.t in 2017 bonded this
 
06:24:36.150 --> 06:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
stretcher road for seven hundred
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's been asserted that this incident
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
was with continental boulevard was an
 
06:25:02.310 --> 06:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to downshift
 
06:25:03.670 --> 06:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
06:25:05.590 --> 06:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
merrimack community
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
the expense of this
 
06:25:07.440 --> 06:25:09.030 align:start position:0%
the expense of this
area

06:25:09.030 --> 06:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
06:25:12.150 --> 06:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
this if it was i would be voting
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
for it
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not voting for it
 
06:25:18.548 --> 06:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
06:25:24.868 --> 06:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
the average cost according to the dot
 
06:25:26.628 --> 06:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
for this roadway
 
06:25:29.590 --> 06:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
that they plow and pave is eighty
 
06:25:34.708 --> 06:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:37.030 --> 06:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
initially merrimack
 
06:25:39.990 --> 06:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to have continental boulevard it
 
06:25:42.468 --> 06:25:42.478 align:start position:0%
is not a state highway
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
it is a municipal road
 
06:25:46.080 --> 06:25:46.948 align:start position:0%
it is a municipal road
and

06:25:46.948 --> 06:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:49.350 --> 06:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
they wanted it because they wanted to
 
06:25:52.150 --> 06:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
develop it they wanted to bring digital
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
in they wanted to bring other industries
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
into merrimack
 
06:26:00.150 --> 06:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
in exchange for that
 
06:26:03.270 --> 06:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system
 
06:26:06.468 --> 06:26:06.478 align:start position:0%
exit 10 11 and 12
 
06:26:08.548 --> 06:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
 
06:26:08.558 --> 06:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
were

06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:26:10.400 --> 06:26:12.868 align:start position:0%
were
created

06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
created
 
06:26:15.990 --> 06:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
eventually this became a problem for the
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
citizens of merrimack
 
06:26:21.750 --> 06:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to pay the tolls
 
06:26:24.548 --> 06:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
so it was eliminated
 
06:26:28.390 --> 06:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
the toll booth at exit 12
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
and then with the exit 11 there was a
 
06:26:31.600 --> 06:26:33.190 align:start position:0%
and then with the exit 11 there was a
bill

06:26:33.190 --> 06:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
presented to our committee
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:26:37.840 --> 06:26:38.788 align:start position:0%
to have
the

06:26:38.788 --> 06:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:26:41.910 --> 06:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
tolls eliminated at exit 11.
 
06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
that did not happen by vote of 18 to 2
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
it was defeated
 
06:26:48.548 --> 06:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
it went
 
06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
what they did is they went to the
 
06:26:54.708 --> 06:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
06:26:56.948 --> 06:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
who sets the tolls
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
and got them to set the toll at exit 11
 
06:27:02.548 --> 06:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
at zero
 
06:27:04.390 --> 06:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
which eliminated
 
06:27:06.948 --> 06:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
that from the scheme
 
06:27:10.070 --> 06:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
and now they've passed uh
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
a bill to get rid of the tolls at exit
 
06:27:12.878 --> 06:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
a bill to get rid of the tolls at exit
10.

06:27:13.830 --> 06:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
10.
 
06:27:16.310 --> 06:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
so in other words they're getting no
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
total money
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
and what you have to understand
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
that all the toll money from the
 
06:27:22.798 --> 06:27:24.150 align:start position:0%
that all the toll money from the
turnpikes

06:27:24.150 --> 06:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
has to be spent on the turnpike
 
06:27:31.590 --> 06:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and at the time when it first happened
 
06:27:33.830 --> 06:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the salt sheds in the storage areas
 
06:27:35.510 --> 06:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
where the trucks
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
the state trucks were a long continental
 
06:27:38.400 --> 06:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
the state trucks were a long continental
boulevard

06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
that has since gone away
 
06:27:43.120 --> 06:27:45.190 align:start position:0%
that has since gone away
so

06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the expenses are now
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of the tolls at
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
exit 10
 
06:27:55.030 --> 06:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
and 11 and 12
 
06:28:00.070 --> 06:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
is 1.7 million dollars annually again
 
06:28:00.080 --> 06:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
is 1.7 million dollars annually again
1.7

06:28:01.990 --> 06:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
1.7
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
the cost to remove the toll plazas
 
06:28:14.708 --> 06:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:16.948 --> 06:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
the other point is
 
06:28:20.230 --> 06:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
that when the money that is collected
 
06:28:21.990 --> 06:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
from the tolls
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
what it has to be used for and again
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
only on the turnpike
 
06:28:29.830 --> 06:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
is for winter maintenance first that's
 
06:28:31.830 --> 06:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
the priority
 
06:28:34.150 --> 06:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
second is preservation
 
06:28:37.510 --> 06:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the third is any new projects
 
06:28:39.350 --> 06:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
so what this is mean
 
06:28:41.430 --> 06:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
that all these projects
 
06:28:43.590 --> 06:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be delayed
 
06:28:46.390 --> 06:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are going to be delayed
 
06:28:48.948 --> 06:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
because the money the revenue was not
 
06:28:48.958 --> 06:28:57.270 align:start position:0%
because the money the revenue was not
there

06:28:57.270 --> 06:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
i think that it would make more sense
 
06:29:00.478 --> 06:29:02.390 align:start position:0%
i think that it would make more sense
for

06:29:02.390 --> 06:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:29:04.708 --> 06:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
and i question the fact whether it's
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to cost merrick mack the sum that
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
they said i will tell you
 
06:29:10.788 --> 06:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
06:29:10.798 --> 06:29:12.390 align:start position:0%
that it was
repaved

06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
repaved
 
06:29:15.910 --> 06:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
in 2017. and it's an average of five
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
years for it to go
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the cost to remove
 
06:29:23.670 --> 06:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
the total booth
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
at exit 10
 
06:29:28.390 --> 06:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
which is in the 10-year plan
 
06:29:31.270 --> 06:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
is eight hundred thousand dollars
 
06:29:36.788 --> 06:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
the member from merrimack representative
 
06:29:40.150 --> 06:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
wrong is recognized to speak in support
 
06:29:42.628 --> 06:29:42.638 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
06:29:45.030 --> 06:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:29:48.468 --> 06:29:48.478 align:start position:0%
i come before you in support of this
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
minority amendment
 
06:29:51.990 --> 06:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
it removes from the 10-year
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
transportation plan as we amended it the
 
06:29:57.350 --> 06:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
transfer of continental boulevard a
 
06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
state road to the town of merrimack
 
06:30:02.868 --> 06:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
the reasoning for making this transfer
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that since merrimack no longer has
 
06:30:07.670 --> 06:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
the three ramp tolls which supported the
 
06:30:10.230 --> 06:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
everett turnpike we should take on the
 
06:30:12.708 --> 06:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
more than two hundred thousand dollars
 
06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
expense of maintaining this road
 
06:30:18.150 --> 06:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
annually it is outrageous and illogical
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
as well as unjust
 
06:30:21.910 --> 06:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
here is why
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
first off let me tell you about
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard
 
06:30:28.468 --> 06:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
it is a connector planned and built by
 
06:30:31.990 --> 06:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
the state to join 101a with the everett
 
06:30:35.110 --> 06:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
turnpikes exit 10 and 11.
 
06:30:37.190 --> 06:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
both state roads
 
06:30:39.670 --> 06:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
it is considered part of the turnpike
 
06:30:39.680 --> 06:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
it is considered part of the turnpike
system

06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a road for townspeople to
 
06:30:45.590 --> 06:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
navigate merrimack
 
06:30:47.270 --> 06:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are no homes on continental
 
06:30:47.280 --> 06:30:48.468 align:start position:0%
there are no homes on continental
boulevard

06:30:48.468 --> 06:30:48.478 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
06:30:51.350 --> 06:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
it is primarily used to get travelers
 
06:30:54.310 --> 06:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
from one state road to another
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
it exists for the benefit of state
 
06:30:56.878 --> 06:30:58.548 align:start position:0%
it exists for the benefit of state
transportation

06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
06:31:01.230 --> 06:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
to think that a town should take over
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this road is
 
06:31:03.360 --> 06:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this road is
ridiculous

06:31:05.190 --> 06:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
second to justify that this transfer
 
06:31:12.230 --> 06:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
to justify this transfer because of the
 
06:31:15.270 --> 06:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
closure of the merrimack ramp tools is
 
06:31:17.030 --> 06:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
also ridiculous
 
06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
for decades decades
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack residents paid for the cost
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
for the turnpike every time a merrimack
 
06:31:29.590 --> 06:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
resident got on or off to go to work or
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
to go home
 
06:31:34.788 --> 06:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
while tens of thousands of drivers south
 
06:31:38.548 --> 06:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
of merrimack paid nothing
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
tolls are user fees
 
06:31:48.390 --> 06:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:48.400 --> 06:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
not

06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:31:52.230 --> 06:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
just some others who get shouldered with
 
06:31:53.830 --> 06:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
the burden
 
06:31:55.750 --> 06:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have a toll booth
 
06:31:58.628 --> 06:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
at the northern boundary of the turnpike
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
in hooksett
 
06:32:03.270 --> 06:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
but the state failed to put one in at
 
06:32:05.270 --> 06:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the southern boundary
 
06:32:08.548 --> 06:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
even though that road the tunnel and
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
other infrastructure is already in place
 
06:32:14.230 --> 06:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
for a toll booth in nashua
 
06:32:16.468 --> 06:32:16.478 align:start position:0%
so the heaviest eight miles of the
 
06:32:19.510 --> 06:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
turnpike from the state line through
 
06:32:19.520 --> 06:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
turnpike from the state line through
nashua

06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
have not paid
 
06:32:26.390 --> 06:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
one penny for that use
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
nor for the new ramps
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
and bridge work nada zilch zero
 
06:32:36.708 --> 06:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
i would go as far to say that if the
 
06:32:39.750 --> 06:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
state kept to their plan to have a toll
 
06:32:42.708 --> 06:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
in nashua the turnpike system would be
 
06:32:44.390 --> 06:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
flush with money
 
06:32:45.990 --> 06:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't be having this
 
06:32:48.150 --> 06:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
discussion today
 
06:32:51.430 --> 06:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
the last point i want to make is this
 
06:32:51.440 --> 06:32:52.468 align:start position:0%
the last point i want to make is this
plan

06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
plan
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
is to dump the cost of continental
 
06:32:57.750 --> 06:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
boulevard on merrimack
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
comes without any discussion with our
 
06:33:03.270 --> 06:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
town leaders or dpw department
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
it takes what should be a state
 
06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
supported cost
 
06:33:10.548 --> 06:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
and turns it into a property tax
 
06:33:14.150 --> 06:33:14.160 align:start position:0%

mr speaker mr speaker i rise in
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the minority amendment
 
06:34:03.750 --> 06:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what it does first i
 
06:34:06.070 --> 06:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody hit that
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
it modifies the majority amendment by
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
taking out one section
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
it takes out the the very first section
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
that says transfer of ownership of
 
06:34:19.110 --> 06:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard it re leaves the
 
06:34:21.670 --> 06:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the majority amendment in place
 
06:34:23.430 --> 06:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
i just want everybody to make sure they
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
when they're voting
 
06:34:28.948 --> 06:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background
 
06:34:31.430 --> 06:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard it here i'll recap the
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
exits in merrimack were constructed
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
by the turnpike some at the requests of
 
06:34:40.548 --> 06:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
the town for development especially for
 
06:34:43.190 --> 06:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
digital corp now fidelity
 
06:34:45.350 --> 06:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
the town acknowledged that they would be
 
06:34:45.360 --> 06:34:46.548 align:start position:0%
the town acknowledged that they would be
told

06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
told
 
06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
but it led to the development of large
 
06:34:50.948 --> 06:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
sections of merrimack
 
06:34:53.110 --> 06:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
and it allowed both business and
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
industrial development
 
06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
over the past several terms these sole
 
06:35:01.190 --> 06:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
plazas have been removed
 
06:35:03.990 --> 06:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and bills that i deem must pass let me
 
06:35:07.030 --> 06:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples in 2020 a
 
06:35:09.750 --> 06:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
democratic senator inserted the removal
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
of one of the toll plazas and one of
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
those infamous
 
06:35:15.670 --> 06:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills that the speaker and
 
06:35:18.230 --> 06:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
senate president agreed would not have a
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee a conference
 
06:35:24.070 --> 06:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
last year 2021 a republican center added
 
06:35:26.548 --> 06:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
the removal of a toll plaza in the house
 
06:35:28.310 --> 06:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
while it was in the senate
 
06:35:32.948 --> 06:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
so the last vestiges of the grand
 
06:35:32.958 --> 06:35:34.310 align:start position:0%
so the last vestiges of the grand
agreement

06:35:34.310 --> 06:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
06:35:36.788 --> 06:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
that opened up merrimack for development
 
06:35:39.190 --> 06:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
is the turnpike's ownership of a portion
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
of continental boulevard it's a fine
 
06:35:44.070 --> 06:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
time to finish the breakup of this
 
06:35:44.080 --> 06:35:45.590 align:start position:0%
time to finish the breakup of this
bargain

06:35:45.590 --> 06:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
bargain
 
06:35:48.548 --> 06:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
by transferring the road to the town
 
06:35:50.468 --> 06:35:50.478 align:start position:0%
you've heard different costs
 
06:35:52.948 --> 06:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'll accept what my good colleague from
 
06:35:55.110 --> 06:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
merrimack said that it's two hundred
 
06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars maintenance in 2.5 in
 
06:36:00.548 --> 06:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
the in the longer term
 
06:36:03.190 --> 06:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
if that is the cost of the town that is
 
06:36:05.830 --> 06:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of the turnpike system
 
06:36:07.830 --> 06:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so everybody who goes through
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
another toll plaza will be paying that
 
06:36:13.750 --> 06:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
amount for the next however long we
 
06:36:15.350 --> 06:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
maintain control of continental
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
boulevard that's not cost downshifting
 
06:36:21.030 --> 06:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
per se to me that is cost shifting to
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
every other person who uses the turnpike
 
06:36:23.520 --> 06:36:24.948 align:start position:0%
every other person who uses the turnpike
system

06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:36:24.958 --> 06:36:25.990 align:start position:0%
system
um

06:36:25.990 --> 06:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard the talks about what it
 
06:36:30.788 --> 06:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
will cost to finish up the removal of
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
the toll plazas but the other thing that
 
06:36:35.910 --> 06:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
has happened within the turnpike system
 
06:36:37.590 --> 06:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
is that because
 
06:36:39.110 --> 06:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:36:41.750 --> 06:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures and others we've had to
 
06:36:44.390 --> 06:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
delay in this 10-year plan all of the
 
06:36:47.670 --> 06:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
major turnpike projects by at least two
 
06:36:47.680 --> 06:36:49.110 align:start position:0%
major turnpike projects by at least two
years

06:36:49.110 --> 06:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:36:51.830 --> 06:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
we can continue to do that
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
that's up to this body to
 
06:36:58.628 --> 06:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
decide for me it is an equity
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
issue should those drivers on the
 
06:37:03.430 --> 06:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
spalding or the rest of the effort pay
 
06:37:05.110 --> 06:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
for what is now in my opinion
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
essentially a town thoroughfare
 
06:37:09.430 --> 06:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee does not
 
06:37:12.070 --> 06:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
think so and ask that you vote down this
 
06:37:12.080 --> 06:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
think so and ask that you vote down this
amendment

06:37:13.990 --> 06:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:37:15.350 --> 06:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure it's not going to be a
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
voice vote by pressing the red button
 
06:37:19.990 --> 06:37:20.000 align:start position:0%

the house will come to order
 
06:39:02.390 --> 06:39:02.400 align:start position:0%

06:39:55.510 --> 06:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
section of the plan
 
06:39:58.948 --> 06:39:58.958 align:start position:0%

town of merrimack's cost that everybody

thank you mr speaker so i i have to feel
 
06:44:35.910 --> 06:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
really badly for our colleagues over in
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
06:44:39.910 --> 06:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
mostly because of my friend from salem
 
06:44:41.590 --> 06:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
who i have to listen to
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
every time we meet about it
 
06:44:45.510 --> 06:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
all their bills are at the end of the
 
06:44:47.270 --> 06:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
day after everyone's tired and no one
 
06:44:49.590 --> 06:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
wants to pay attention and so forth
 
06:44:51.350 --> 06:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
but more importantly i have a chairman
 
06:44:53.110 --> 06:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
who needs to leave
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
early and we're not going to get to his
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
bills before he has to leave so
 
06:44:59.910 --> 06:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
we really need to hear from him
 
06:45:02.310 --> 06:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill so if you could please vote
 
06:45:12.390 --> 06:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:13.750 --> 06:45:13.760 align:start position:0%

to hb 1097 as amended
 
06:47:04.628 --> 06:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
i agree with my distinguished colleagues
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means committee
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the matter of remote employment and
 
06:47:11.190 --> 06:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
multi-state income taxation is worthy of
 
06:47:13.190 --> 06:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
protecting new hampshire residents in
 
06:47:15.110 --> 06:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
fact i love the idea behind the bill
 
06:47:17.030 --> 06:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's a marvelous talking point for our
 
06:47:19.590 --> 06:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
campaigns after all who here among us
 
06:47:21.430 --> 06:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
does not want to support new hampshire
 
06:47:21.440 --> 06:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
does not want to support new hampshire
workers

06:47:23.030 --> 06:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
workers
 
06:47:23.040 --> 06:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
workers
but

06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:47:26.788 --> 06:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
we must be sure that this legislation
 
06:47:29.430 --> 06:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
actually protects new hampshire workers
 
06:47:31.628 --> 06:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
and this cautious committee has
 
06:47:33.670 --> 06:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically rushed to legislate
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
in an area where fiscal prudence
 
06:47:38.230 --> 06:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
patience and study should drive our
 
06:47:40.948 --> 06:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
policy making mr speaker i oppose this
 
06:47:43.510 --> 06:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill for two primary reasons first i
 
06:47:45.190 --> 06:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill because it fails to
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
properly consider the legal complexities
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
involved in crafting a litigation
 
06:47:49.280 --> 06:47:50.468 align:start position:0%
involved in crafting a litigation
strategy

06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
06:47:52.868 --> 06:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
the majority lists several guesses why
 
06:47:54.788 --> 06:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
the previous litigation of this very
 
06:47:54.798 --> 06:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
the previous litigation of this very
matter

06:47:55.670 --> 06:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
was unsuccessful before the united
 
06:47:59.190 --> 06:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
states supreme court
 
06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
then selectively focuses the language
 
06:48:02.548 --> 06:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
here on a limited issue rather
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
developing rather than developing a
 
06:48:06.868 --> 06:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
broad litigation approach
 
06:48:09.030 --> 06:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
after the amended language was offered
 
06:48:11.110 --> 06:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
the committee did not gather substantive
 
06:48:12.868 --> 06:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
testimony from constitutional
 
06:48:15.830 --> 06:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation or legal experts
 
06:48:18.548 --> 06:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
policy experts or independent tax
 
06:48:18.558 --> 06:48:19.830 align:start position:0%
policy experts or independent tax
experts

06:48:19.830 --> 06:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
experts
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
the committee did not study the most
 
06:48:23.190 --> 06:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
likely reasons for the previous denial
 
06:48:25.750 --> 06:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
by the u.s supreme court nor did they
 
06:48:27.990 --> 06:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
identify the most likely pathway forward
 
06:48:30.468 --> 06:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
for future success
 
06:48:32.708 --> 06:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
instead the committee heard an assertion
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general's office
 
06:48:37.030 --> 06:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
approved of the language offered
 
06:48:39.270 --> 06:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that a promise
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the amended bill encompassed the
 
06:48:43.270 --> 06:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
strongest legal position for the state
 
06:48:45.590 --> 06:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
to protect its citizens
 
06:48:46.948 --> 06:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
no representative from the attorney
 
06:48:48.788 --> 06:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
general's office was made available to
 
06:48:50.868 --> 06:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
comment on that proposed language
 
06:48:52.948 --> 06:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
no additional hearings were held to
 
06:48:56.310 --> 06:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
verify those assertions to ask questions
 
06:48:57.910 --> 06:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
or to confirm the soundness of that
 
06:48:59.670 --> 06:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
legal strategy
 
06:49:01.590 --> 06:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
no new facts were presented to suggest
 
06:49:03.350 --> 06:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the timing of this legislation is
 
06:49:05.590 --> 06:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
urgent right now
 
06:49:05.600 --> 06:49:06.548 align:start position:0%
urgent right now
so

06:49:06.548 --> 06:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
what does the state gain by rushing this
 
06:49:10.948 --> 06:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
legislation through and the consequences
 
06:49:13.750 --> 06:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
of being improperly prepared for future
 
06:49:13.760 --> 06:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
of being improperly prepared for future
litigation

06:49:15.510 --> 06:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
06:49:16.628 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
is a huge
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
greater risk make no mistake this bill
 
06:49:21.910 --> 06:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
could leave new hampshire in a worse
 
06:49:23.910 --> 06:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
position to defend its remote workers in
 
06:49:25.190 --> 06:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
the future
 
06:49:26.708 --> 06:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
and we should acknowledge that new
 
06:49:29.110 --> 06:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire taxpayers will be responsible
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
for the tens if not thousands or
 
06:49:32.868 --> 06:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands
 
06:49:34.548 --> 06:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
of dollars to litigate
 
06:49:36.788 --> 06:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
a sub-optimal position
 
06:49:39.350 --> 06:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
the minority urges cautions and caution
 
06:49:40.628 --> 06:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
in proceeding without further
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
investigation into the legal
 
06:49:43.750 --> 06:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
complexities here
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
and second i oppose this bill
 
06:49:49.190 --> 06:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
for its technical deficiencies and with
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of irish luck you'll just
 
06:49:53.990 --> 06:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
hear me for one more moment
 
06:49:55.750 --> 06:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
the majority revised the mandatory
 
06:49:57.670 --> 06:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
language of the original bill
 
06:49:59.270 --> 06:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
and replaced it with a permissive
 
06:50:01.030 --> 06:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the state's sovereign
 
06:50:01.040 --> 06:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the state's sovereign
power

06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
see this is problematic because the
 
06:50:05.350 --> 06:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
language change may undermine the
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
state's right to bring a lawsuit there
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
is if there's no mandate for new
 
06:50:10.708 --> 06:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire to defend its student
 
06:50:10.718 --> 06:50:12.788 align:start position:0%
hampshire to defend its student
sovereignty

06:50:12.788 --> 06:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
06:50:13.990 --> 06:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
we never heard from the attorney
 
06:50:15.990 --> 06:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
general's office as to why the suggested
 
06:50:18.468 --> 06:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
language change to permissive was so
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
important so we're left with answered
 
06:50:22.708 --> 06:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know does this undermine
 
06:50:27.590 --> 06:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the position that we're intending to to
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:33.910 --> 06:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
so second the bill also creates this
 
06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
problematic double taxation standard in
 
06:50:37.990 --> 06:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
one paragraph it stands for the
 
06:50:40.070 --> 06:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
principle that no other state may tax
 
06:50:41.990 --> 06:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens who work remotely
 
06:50:43.270 --> 06:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
06:50:45.990 --> 06:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
but then in another paragraph reaffirms
 
06:50:47.830 --> 06:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's right to tax another
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
state's citizens located outside of new
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire through our business profits
 
06:50:54.070 --> 06:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
and enterprises taxes
 
06:50:55.910 --> 06:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
the logical incongruency here of the
 
06:50:57.270 --> 06:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
double tax
 
06:50:59.590 --> 06:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
double standard and taxation cannot be
 
06:50:59.600 --> 06:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
double standard and taxation cannot be
ignored

06:51:01.270 --> 06:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
and we also have to remember the state's
 
06:51:06.150 --> 06:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
shift to single sales factor taxation
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
and determining those big
 
06:51:09.190 --> 06:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
06:51:10.708 --> 06:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
you've got to wonder is this bill
 
06:51:12.548 --> 06:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
intention unintentionally harming our
 
06:51:15.030 --> 06:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
position by setting up our state to lose
 
06:51:16.868 --> 06:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
significant portion of its revenue
 
06:51:16.878 --> 06:51:19.110 align:start position:0%
significant portion of its revenue
stream

06:51:19.110 --> 06:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
stream
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
this body has a responsibility
 
06:51:23.270 --> 06:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be prudent
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
to be patient
 
06:51:26.948 --> 06:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
and to properly study the issue before
 
06:51:26.958 --> 06:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
and to properly study the issue before
us

06:51:27.750 --> 06:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:51:29.590 --> 06:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
there are simply too many unanswered
 
06:51:31.590 --> 06:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions too many unknowns and too many
 
06:51:33.510 --> 06:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
risks to support this legislation as
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
written for these reasons i urge my
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote no on the motion for
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment on hb 1097
 
06:51:42.868 --> 06:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
so that another motion may be put forth
 
06:51:44.868 --> 06:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and happy st
 
06:51:49.510 --> 06:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
the member from charlestown
 
06:51:52.310 --> 06:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry is recognized
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
 
06:51:53.520 --> 06:51:58.390 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
report

06:51:58.390 --> 06:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:01.670 --> 06:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
i make my maiden voyage to the well
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
to urge your support of hb 1097
 
06:52:11.670 --> 06:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
which has the
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support of a 17-6 majority
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.510 --> 06:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think everybody is generally familiar
 
06:52:24.070 --> 06:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
with the background so i won't labor it
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
but we know that during the pandemic
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
massachusetts asserted a taxation power
 
06:52:31.270 --> 06:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't expect
 
06:52:33.110 --> 06:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
claiming that
 
06:52:35.190 --> 06:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
while staying home and working
 
06:52:39.590 --> 06:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
exclusively in new hampshire
 
06:52:41.830 --> 06:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to massachusetts
 
06:52:45.990 --> 06:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
personal income tax and withholding
 
06:52:48.948 --> 06:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
i venture we all had a visceral reaction
 
06:52:50.788 --> 06:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
06:52:50.798 --> 06:52:52.948 align:start position:0%
that that was
illegitimate

06:52:52.948 --> 06:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
illegitimate
 
06:52:54.868 --> 06:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
our governor objected
 
06:52:54.878 --> 06:52:56.468 align:start position:0%
our governor objected
massachusetts

06:52:56.468 --> 06:52:56.478 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
06:52:58.390 --> 06:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
did not yield
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the result was our attorney general
 
06:53:04.070 --> 06:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
took a case to the united states supreme
 
06:53:04.080 --> 06:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
took a case to the united states supreme
court

06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:53:07.750 --> 06:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
invoking original jurisdiction
 
06:53:09.590 --> 06:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
in which the court can take a case to
 
06:53:13.190 --> 06:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
resolve a conflict between two states
 
06:53:15.510 --> 06:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court declined to take
 
06:53:17.750 --> 06:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
the case
 
06:53:20.788 --> 06:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
there are theories that it's mandatory
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
but when the supreme court chooses not
 
06:53:25.750 --> 06:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
to take a case it's under no obligation
 
06:53:28.310 --> 06:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
to explain why
 
06:53:30.868 --> 06:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
so once left to wonder why
 
06:53:33.030 --> 06:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is left to wonder
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
exactly how will we repel
 
06:53:37.350 --> 06:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
such an intrusion
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
on our sovereign interests if it arises
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
06:53:44.788 --> 06:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
the pandemic came unexpectedly
 
06:53:46.868 --> 06:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
the reactions to the pandemic including
 
06:53:49.590 --> 06:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
this massachusetts taxation act
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
were sudden
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and unanticipated
 
06:53:55.670 --> 06:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility whether it's a
 
06:53:55.680 --> 06:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility whether it's a
pandemic

06:53:57.430 --> 06:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
06:53:59.590 --> 06:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
or shifting
 
06:53:59.600 --> 06:54:01.110 align:start position:0%
or shifting
commuter

06:54:01.110 --> 06:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
commuter
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
and work patterns
 
06:54:05.830 --> 06:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
or high gas prices
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
helping to persuade employers to allow
 
06:54:10.150 --> 06:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
their workers to work from home
 
06:54:12.070 --> 06:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
there is a distinct possibility that
 
06:54:14.468 --> 06:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
this could arise at any time and
 
06:54:14.478 --> 06:54:16.070 align:start position:0%
this could arise at any time and
unfortunately

06:54:16.070 --> 06:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
06:54:19.670 --> 06:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:22.150 --> 06:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
without having been repelled
 
06:54:24.310 --> 06:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
is all too likely to be revoked to be
 
06:54:26.548 --> 06:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
invoked again
 
06:54:28.390 --> 06:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
from any one of our neighbors who all
 
06:54:28.400 --> 06:54:29.350 align:start position:0%
from any one of our neighbors who all
have

06:54:29.350 --> 06:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:54:30.868 --> 06:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
income taxes
 
06:54:32.948 --> 06:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
and a vested interest in collecting as
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
much as they can
 
06:54:39.670 --> 06:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
so hb 1097 is originally introduced
 
06:54:41.670 --> 06:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
essentially asserted that massachusetts
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
or any other state has no power
 
06:54:46.708 --> 06:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
to tax in this way
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
but we don't have actually the ability
 
06:54:50.788 --> 06:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
to tell another state what their power
 
06:54:53.350 --> 06:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
is what we can do though
 
06:54:55.270 --> 06:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
is we can
 
06:54:58.628 --> 06:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
directly place into law
 
06:55:02.390 --> 06:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
a clear statement of our taxation policy
 
06:55:04.708 --> 06:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
and our sovereign interest
 
06:55:07.590 --> 06:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
and thus arm the attorney general
 
06:55:10.548 --> 06:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
in the case they have to litigate again
 
06:55:14.948 --> 06:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
to establish the basis for standing
 
06:55:16.230 --> 06:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
the likely
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
thinking of the supreme court was
 
06:55:20.830 --> 06:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's the individual taxpayer who's
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
aggrieved and that taxpayer would have
 
06:55:25.590 --> 06:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
to file a lawsuit
 
06:55:25.600 --> 06:55:26.948 align:start position:0%
to file a lawsuit
imagine

06:55:26.948 --> 06:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
you're just a guy trying to bring home
 
06:55:33.110 --> 06:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
his income without massachusetts taking
 
06:55:34.868 --> 06:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
a portion of it and you're going to have
 
06:55:36.708 --> 06:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
to litigate to the united states supreme
 
06:55:36.718 --> 06:55:38.468 align:start position:0%
to litigate to the united states supreme
court

06:55:38.468 --> 06:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:55:38.478 --> 06:55:39.670 align:start position:0%
court
so

06:55:39.670 --> 06:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:55:41.430 --> 06:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
in short
 
06:55:43.750 --> 06:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
06:55:46.070 --> 06:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
was co-drafted with attorneys from the

06:55:49.990 --> 06:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
who attended four or five sessions of

and when the draft was
 
06:55:58.958 --> 06:56:00.310 align:start position:0%
and when the draft was
completed

06:56:00.310 --> 06:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
completed
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
it was placed directly under the eyes of
 
06:56:05.110 --> 06:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general formella
 
06:56:09.430 --> 06:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
who affirmed that he wants this in law
 
06:56:11.910 --> 06:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
so what the minority has basically told
 
06:56:11.920 --> 06:56:13.510 align:start position:0%
so what the minority has basically told
you

06:56:13.510 --> 06:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:56:17.110 --> 06:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
is that tax laws complex
 
06:56:18.868 --> 06:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
they think there might be a way to
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
further perfect and
 
06:56:24.390 --> 06:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
develop a silver bullet
 
06:56:26.230 --> 06:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
but they have yet to tell us what
 
06:56:28.628 --> 06:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
changes they would make
 
06:56:30.468 --> 06:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion
 
06:56:31.750 --> 06:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
06:56:34.868 --> 06:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
embrace hb 1097
 
06:56:36.390 --> 06:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
with the blessing of the attorney
 
06:56:36.400 --> 06:56:37.510 align:start position:0%

general
 
06:56:39.750 --> 06:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
and if any of us comes up with an even
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
better idea later
 
06:56:43.030 --> 06:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
i am sure the ways and means committee
 
06:56:45.030 --> 06:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
will gladly look at it
 
06:56:46.708 --> 06:56:46.718 align:start position:0%

06:57:52.708 --> 06:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative you know keller requests
 
06:57:54.310 --> 06:57:54.320 align:start position:0%

06:59:34.548 --> 06:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
long this vote takes
 
06:59:36.868 --> 06:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote representative

06:59:52.628 --> 06:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
if i know that personal income
 
06:59:55.190 --> 06:59:55.200 align:start position:0%

by other states
but

07:00:06.390 --> 07:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:00:08.948 --> 07:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
if i believe that the proposal contained
 
07:00:11.750 --> 07:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
in hb 1097
 
07:00:13.590 --> 07:00:13.600 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
07:01:06.310 --> 07:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
if i know this bill addresses the issue
 
07:01:08.708 --> 07:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
of personal income of new hampshire
 
07:01:11.190 --> 07:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
resident that is earned entirely within
 
07:01:13.030 --> 07:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
07:01:14.868 --> 07:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
and another state
 
07:01:17.750 --> 07:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
is subjecting it to their income tax and
 
07:01:17.760 --> 07:01:19.430 align:start position:0%
is subjecting it to their income tax and
withholding

07:01:19.430 --> 07:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
withholding
 
07:01:21.430 --> 07:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the committee
 
07:01:23.990 --> 07:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
believes that this bill addresses a very
 
07:01:25.510 --> 07:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
07:01:27.910 --> 07:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
that was offensive to new hampshire
 
07:01:29.910 --> 07:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
independent sovereignty
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
and that this issue must be addressed
 
07:01:32.558 --> 07:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
and that this issue must be addressed
permanently

07:01:34.070 --> 07:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
07:01:35.830 --> 07:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
lest it
 
07:01:38.468 --> 07:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
arise again without recourse
 
07:01:40.868 --> 07:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
and if i know the committee concluded
 
07:01:43.510 --> 07:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill needed to be reframed
 
07:01:45.270 --> 07:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
so in connection with the attorney
 
07:01:45.280 --> 07:01:46.468 align:start position:0%
so in connection with the attorney
general

07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
general
 
07:01:47.670 --> 07:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the department of revenue
 
07:01:47.680 --> 07:01:49.110 align:start position:0%
and the department of revenue
administration

07:01:49.110 --> 07:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
administration
 
07:01:50.868 --> 07:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
the committee's amendment seeks to
 
07:01:52.468 --> 07:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
re-aim the bill
 
07:01:55.830 --> 07:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
towards firmly and unequivocally
 
07:01:58.868 --> 07:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
establishing an explicit claim of policy
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
and sovereign interests
 
07:02:03.750 --> 07:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
that will put other states on notice
 
07:02:06.070 --> 07:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
and clearly lay the foundation
 
07:02:08.468 --> 07:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
for successful litigation if it should
 
07:02:10.948 --> 07:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
ever become necessary
 
07:02:14.230 --> 07:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
then would you join me in the bipartisan
 
07:02:15.830 --> 07:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
vote of the committee and press the
 
07:02:19.270 --> 07:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:20.788 --> 07:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
07:02:22.628 --> 07:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
report about to pass with amendment this
 
07:02:24.868 --> 07:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
is a roll call vote if you're in favor
 
07:02:26.468 --> 07:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
you'll press the red button if you're
 
07:02:28.468 --> 07:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
opposed you'll press the green if you're
 
07:02:30.310 --> 07:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
opposed you'll press the red button
 
07:02:32.468 --> 07:02:32.478 align:start position:0%
that's why we ask voting stations are
 
07:02:46.150 --> 07:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:52.390 --> 07:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:03.740 --> 07:03:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:03.750 --> 07:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:03:25.270 --> 07:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:25.280 --> 07:03:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:03:36.070 --> 07:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:44.310 --> 07:03:44.320 align:start position:0%

07:04:04.788 --> 07:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
have all members president had an
 
07:04:06.948 --> 07:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
07:04:08.788 --> 07:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
i realize it's anticlimactic at this
 
07:04:11.030 --> 07:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
point but 251 having voted in the
 
07:04:13.110 --> 07:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
affirmative 72 and the negative the
 
07:04:15.030 --> 07:04:15.040 align:start position:0%

07:10:05.670 --> 07:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
07:10:08.788 --> 07:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
know that house bill 1221
 
07:10:10.948 --> 07:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
in its original form
 
07:10:13.350 --> 07:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
provides tax relief for both
 
07:10:15.750 --> 07:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
the business enterprise tax
 
07:10:19.110 --> 07:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
and the business profits tax
 
07:10:22.070 --> 07:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
but that the committee amendment
 
07:10:24.468 --> 07:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
would only reduce the business profits
 
07:10:24.478 --> 07:10:26.070 align:start position:0%
would only reduce the business profits
tax

07:10:26.070 --> 07:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
tax
 
07:10:27.910 --> 07:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
07:10:29.590 --> 07:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
if i also know
 
07:10:32.788 --> 07:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
that the business profits tax is mostly
 
07:10:35.590 --> 07:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
paid by larger companies
 
07:10:37.590 --> 07:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
while smaller businesses
 
07:10:39.750 --> 07:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
are much more likely to pay just the
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
07:10:44.548 --> 07:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
07:10:47.110 --> 07:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
if i further know
 
07:10:49.270 --> 07:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
that the small businesses were much more
 
07:10:51.910 --> 07:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
likely to be negatively impacted during
 
07:10:53.590 --> 07:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
07:10:55.990 --> 07:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
07:10:58.548 --> 07:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
they are at least as deserving if not
 
07:11:01.270 --> 07:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
more deserving as larger businesses to
 
07:11:01.280 --> 07:11:02.150 align:start position:0%
more deserving as larger businesses to

07:11:07.830 --> 07:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
07:11:10.788 --> 07:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire new hampshire has
 
07:11:13.510 --> 07:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
had several other rounds of business
 
07:11:13.520 --> 07:11:15.750 align:start position:0%
had several other rounds of business
relief

07:11:15.750 --> 07:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
relief
 
07:11:17.910 --> 07:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the past seven years
 
07:11:19.990 --> 07:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
and despite assertions that these cuts
 
07:11:22.310 --> 07:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
would undermine our business tax and
 
07:11:22.320 --> 07:11:23.830 align:start position:0%
would undermine our business tax and
revenues

07:11:23.830 --> 07:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
07:11:26.230 --> 07:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
our business taxes for this fiscal year
 
07:11:28.468 --> 07:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
are currently more than 88 percent
 
07:11:30.548 --> 07:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
higher than they were
 
07:11:34.150 --> 07:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
the final year at the highest rates
 
07:11:36.390 --> 07:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
finally mr speaker
 
07:11:39.110 --> 07:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that this fiscal year alone
 
07:11:41.430 --> 07:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
through just eight months
 
07:11:43.190 --> 07:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
our business taxes
 
07:11:45.670 --> 07:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
are already more than 91 million dollars
 
07:11:48.230 --> 07:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and overall revenues are
 
07:11:51.830 --> 07:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
more than 191 million dollars over plan
 
07:11:54.548 --> 07:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
so we can clearly afford to give relief
 
07:11:54.558 --> 07:11:55.830 align:start position:0%
so we can clearly afford to give relief
for

07:11:55.830 --> 07:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:11:58.070 --> 07:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
and b-p-t
 
07:11:58.080 --> 07:11:58.868 align:start position:0%

then

07:11:58.868 --> 07:11:58.878 align:start position:0%

this bill originally
 
07:12:46.548 --> 07:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
was to reduce the business profits tax
 
07:12:49.030 --> 07:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the business enterprise tax
 
07:12:51.430 --> 07:12:51.440 align:start position:0%

07:12:58.390 --> 07:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
07:12:58.400 --> 07:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
that we have
instituted

07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
instituted
 
07:13:03.350 --> 07:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
through hospital 2 last year and others
 
07:13:04.788 --> 07:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the business and
 
07:13:07.430 --> 07:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax business profits tax
 
07:13:09.510 --> 07:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
mills and rooms tax
 
07:13:11.990 --> 07:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going to glide down to zero
 
07:13:14.548 --> 07:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
on the interest and dividend tax
 
07:13:16.948 --> 07:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
and we also raise the threshold for
 
07:13:19.510 --> 07:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
filing the business enterprise tax
 
07:13:21.910 --> 07:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
raised the threshold for filing the
 
07:13:23.190 --> 07:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
business tax
 
07:13:24.708 --> 07:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
07:13:26.948 --> 07:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
that yes our
 
07:13:29.910 --> 07:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes are high
 
07:13:32.310 --> 07:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's two major reasons for that if i
 
07:13:32.320 --> 07:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
there's two major reasons for that if i
know

07:13:33.190 --> 07:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:13:35.990 --> 07:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're high because
 
07:13:37.750 --> 07:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't change the
 
07:13:40.788 --> 07:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
tax laws for ppp loans
 
07:13:42.150 --> 07:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
07:13:45.270 --> 07:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
the businesses had to pay taxes on those
 
07:13:47.110 --> 07:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be about 100 million
 
07:13:49.910 --> 07:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to have to be refunded
 
07:13:51.990 --> 07:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
07:13:53.590 --> 07:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
that there's been a
 
07:13:56.150 --> 07:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
number of stimuluses over the last
 
07:13:57.030 --> 07:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
07:13:57.040 --> 07:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
couple of years

hundred dollars we get checks
 
07:14:03.440 --> 07:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars we get checks
for

07:14:05.750 --> 07:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
our employment and all kinds of checks
 
07:14:10.000 --> 07:14:10.868 align:start position:0%
our employment and all kinds of checks
now

07:14:10.868 --> 07:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:14:14.310 --> 07:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
that raises our profits and you we're
 
07:14:17.270 --> 07:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
seeing that now those are one-time
 
07:14:17.280 --> 07:14:18.070 align:start position:0%
seeing that now those are one-time
things

07:14:18.070 --> 07:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
07:14:20.468 --> 07:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
if the member will suspend
 
07:14:22.788 --> 07:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
this is a parliamentary inquiry
 
07:14:25.350 --> 07:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay if i know that that raises our
 
07:14:30.070 --> 07:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
profits and this is a one-time event
 
07:14:32.390 --> 07:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that this amendment
 
07:14:32.400 --> 07:14:33.670 align:start position:0%
and that this amendment
reduces

07:14:33.670 --> 07:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
reduces
 
07:14:35.590 --> 07:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
changes the

and if i know
that

07:14:52.230 --> 07:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:55.270 --> 07:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:59.030 --> 07:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
due to 100 million dollars of refunds
 
07:15:01.830 --> 07:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
and not receiving stimulus tax in the
 
07:15:03.750 --> 07:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
future years
 
07:15:06.310 --> 07:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
07:15:07.990 --> 07:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
very reasonable
 
07:15:09.270 --> 07:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
then would you
 
07:15:17.510 --> 07:15:17.520 align:start position:0%

how to word it so i think it's a
 
07:17:31.760 --> 07:17:32.548 align:start position:0%
how to word it so i think it's a
question

07:17:32.548 --> 07:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:17:34.708 --> 07:17:34.718 align:start position:0%

at the beginning of the discussion
 
07:17:43.190 --> 07:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
something was said
 
07:17:45.510 --> 07:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
that would indicate
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the chair of ways and means
 
07:17:52.708 --> 07:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
would be more likely
 
07:17:52.718 --> 07:17:54.070 align:start position:0%
would be more likely
to

07:17:54.070 --> 07:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:17:56.468 --> 07:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
give members a favor
 
07:17:56.478 --> 07:17:58.830 align:start position:0%
give members a favor

07:18:01.830 --> 07:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
if if
 
07:18:04.948 --> 07:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
we voted with him there is no one in
 
07:18:06.628 --> 07:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
this body
 
07:18:09.590 --> 07:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
who is more honorable than the chair of
 
07:18:12.230 --> 07:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
wasteland if you were recognized for a
 
07:18:12.240 --> 07:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
wasteland if you were recognized for a
question

07:18:13.190 --> 07:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:18:16.708 --> 07:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
and my question is how do we
 
07:18:23.670 --> 07:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:26.070 --> 07:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
once once again representative i'm going
 
07:18:32.310 --> 07:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:34.868 --> 07:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
the motion before us now is the majority
 
07:18:37.430 --> 07:18:37.440 align:start position:0%

07:18:55.190 --> 07:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i rise to speak against the pending
 
07:18:57.590 --> 07:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
otpa motion
 
07:19:00.628 --> 07:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
on hb 1221.
 
07:19:03.670 --> 07:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
the amended version of hp 1221
 
07:19:06.070 --> 07:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
reduces the business profits tax from a
 
07:19:07.468 --> 07:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
07:19:09.510 --> 07:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
67.6 percent
 
07:19:11.510 --> 07:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
of net taxable
 
07:19:14.548 --> 07:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
business profits to a rate of 7.5
 
07:19:14.558 --> 07:19:15.670 align:start position:0%
business profits to a rate of 7.5
percent

07:19:15.670 --> 07:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:19:17.910 --> 07:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
that is all it does
 
07:19:19.830 --> 07:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
it makes no change in the business
 
07:19:22.150 --> 07:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
07:19:25.590 --> 07:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
this this single decimal
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
bpt tax rate reduction
 
07:19:30.548 --> 07:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
is expected per
 
07:19:33.030 --> 07:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
07:19:33.040 --> 07:19:34.230 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
estimates

07:19:34.230 --> 07:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
07:19:36.948 --> 07:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
to lower the state's total business tax
 
07:19:40.070 --> 07:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
revenues by about 2 million dollars in
 
07:19:42.548 --> 07:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023
 
07:19:45.030 --> 07:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then the annual loss is expected to
 
07:19:46.070 --> 07:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
build up
 
07:19:49.910 --> 07:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
to about 8.5 million dollars per year
 
07:19:53.750 --> 07:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
starting in fiscal year 2024
 
07:19:56.788 --> 07:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
and this hb 2021
 
07:19:58.230 --> 07:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
revenue loss
 
07:19:59.910 --> 07:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
will be additional
 
07:20:02.388 --> 07:20:02.398 align:start position:0%
to a probable 100 million dollars in
 
07:20:05.030 --> 07:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
revenue losses attributable to prior
 
07:20:08.230 --> 07:20:08.240 align:start position:0%

07:20:10.868 --> 07:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
07:20:13.670 --> 07:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax is paid mostly
 
07:20:16.868 --> 07:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
by big business as you have heard
 
07:20:18.788 --> 07:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
of the 77

07:20:29.750 --> 07:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
671
 
07:20:32.548 --> 07:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
or about one percent of all filers
 
07:20:35.670 --> 07:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
paid close to 80
 
07:20:38.708 --> 07:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
of the 515 million dollars in business
 
07:20:42.708 --> 07:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue received that year
 
07:20:45.830 --> 07:20:45.840 align:start position:0%

07:20:48.310 --> 07:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
had taxable profits above 1 million
 
07:20:50.468 --> 07:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
dollars per year

most likely because new hampshire has

mr speaker as several speakers before me
 
07:26:25.510 --> 07:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
have now
 
07:26:29.750 --> 07:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
announced the original hb 1221 proposed
 
07:26:31.750 --> 07:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
to cut the business enterprise tax and
 
07:26:33.830 --> 07:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax we all know
 
07:26:36.150 --> 07:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
that now it's been said more than once
 
07:26:38.070 --> 07:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just voted on and
 
07:26:39.910 --> 07:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
approved is only going to lower the
 
07:26:42.070 --> 07:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
business profits tax so the
 
07:26:44.310 --> 07:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
so any revenue hit to the state
 
07:26:46.868 --> 07:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
is very minimal it's it's estimated to
 
07:26:48.948 --> 07:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
be eight million dollars but the thing
 
07:26:51.350 --> 07:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we have seen is every time we have
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
cut taxes
 
07:26:55.590 --> 07:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in tax revenue
 
07:26:58.070 --> 07:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so who knows the 8 million may it may
 
07:27:00.628 --> 07:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
actually be zero
 
07:27:05.670 --> 07:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:07.430 --> 07:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
07:27:09.590 --> 07:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
many taxes were lowered in previous
 
07:27:09.600 --> 07:27:10.468 align:start position:0%
many taxes were lowered in previous
years

07:27:10.468 --> 07:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:27:12.230 --> 07:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so one of the that was one of the
 
07:27:12.240 --> 07:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
and so one of the that was one of the
reasons

07:27:13.190 --> 07:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
as representative major mentioned that
 
07:27:18.628 --> 07:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
we focus just on the bpt right now is
 
07:27:20.388 --> 07:27:20.398 align:start position:0%
because we want things to settle down we
 
07:27:23.270 --> 07:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to see how the ppp
 
07:27:25.110 --> 07:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
loans and the coveted relief funds
 
07:27:27.750 --> 07:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
affect the tax in the end
 
07:27:30.310 --> 07:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
now some will say and some have already
 
07:27:30.320 --> 07:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
now some will say and some have already
said

07:27:31.190 --> 07:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:27:33.270 --> 07:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
that big business is going to profit
 
07:27:36.788 --> 07:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
from this i i disagree with that basic
 
07:27:39.190 --> 07:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
assertion there are a lot of small
 
07:27:41.350 --> 07:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
businesses that are paying the business
 
07:27:43.910 --> 07:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
profits tax and not paying the business
 
07:27:45.510 --> 07:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
07:27:48.070 --> 07:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
both those thresholds were increased the
 
07:27:50.468 --> 07:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
business profits tax threshold and the
 
07:27:52.788 --> 07:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax threshold have
 
07:27:55.430 --> 07:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
both both been raised and that's helping
 
07:27:56.788 --> 07:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
small business
 
07:27:59.670 --> 07:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i i beg to differ even a 0.1 percent
 
07:28:03.190 --> 07:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
decrease helps business
 
07:28:03.200 --> 07:28:05.270 align:start position:0%
decrease helps business
furthermore

07:28:05.270 --> 07:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
07:28:07.510 --> 07:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
when we think about those who are
 
07:28:09.670 --> 07:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about coming to new hampshire
 
07:28:11.030 --> 07:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
and bringing their business to new
 
07:28:11.040 --> 07:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
and bringing their business to new
hampshire

07:28:11.990 --> 07:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:28:13.670 --> 07:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
and those who are in new hampshire that
 
07:28:16.548 --> 07:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
want to we want them to stay here every
 
07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:21.270 --> 07:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
now we
 
07:28:23.510 --> 07:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
compare very favorably to the other
 
07:28:27.030 --> 07:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
states massachusetts is at eight percent
 
07:28:30.150 --> 07:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
so they'd compare with our 7.5 vermont
 
07:28:33.510 --> 07:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
is at 8.5 percent as soon as you net
 
07:28:35.830 --> 07:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
more than 25 thousand dollars
 
07:28:37.110 --> 07:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to venture to say there's a
 
07:28:39.030 --> 07:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses that make more than 25
 
07:28:39.040 --> 07:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses that make more than 25
000.

07:28:40.070 --> 07:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
000.
 
07:28:40.080 --> 07:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
000.
so

07:28:41.030 --> 07:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:28:42.310 --> 07:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
07:28:43.910 --> 07:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
this tax reduction will be good for new
 
07:28:45.590 --> 07:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
07:28:47.270 --> 07:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
good for this state
 
07:28:49.030 --> 07:28:49.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
07:29:41.270 --> 07:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
07:29:43.830 --> 07:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
as the chair
 
07:29:46.070 --> 07:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
as our chair said
 
07:29:46.080 --> 07:29:47.190 align:start position:0%
as our chair said
earlier

07:29:47.190 --> 07:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:29:49.590 --> 07:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
that there have been major changes to
 
07:29:53.190 --> 07:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
our tax rates law and structure in
 
07:29:54.628 --> 07:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
07:29:57.350 --> 07:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
not just in this term
 
07:30:01.270 --> 07:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
as well as unforeseeable blows
 
07:30:01.280 --> 07:30:02.788 align:start position:0%
as well as unforeseeable blows
and

07:30:02.788 --> 07:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:06.948 --> 07:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
one-time federal supports to our economy
 
07:30:09.110 --> 07:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
07:30:09.120 --> 07:30:10.070 align:start position:0%
and if i know
that

07:30:10.070 --> 07:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:30:12.150 --> 07:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
07:30:14.628 --> 07:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
which businesses as well as residents
 
07:30:16.070 --> 07:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
07:30:19.110 --> 07:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
rise even faster when the state deficits
 
07:30:22.628 --> 07:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
cause shortfalls in municipal or school
 
07:30:26.310 --> 07:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:29.350 --> 07:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
and if i know that our committee finds
 
07:30:32.070 --> 07:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
it exceedingly difficult to forecast
 
07:30:35.190 --> 07:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
whether we will find ourselves next year
 
07:30:37.590 --> 07:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
maybe even the end of this year
 
07:30:38.868 --> 07:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
or in
 
07:30:42.150 --> 07:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
several years to come in deficit or in
 
07:30:42.160 --> 07:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
several years to come in deficit or in
surplus

07:30:43.830 --> 07:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
07:30:46.310 --> 07:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
and finally if i believe that it is
 
07:30:49.750 --> 07:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
foolhardy to make this further totally
 
07:30:49.760 --> 07:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
foolhardy to make this further totally
symbolic

07:30:51.190 --> 07:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
symbolic
 
07:30:54.310 --> 07:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
0.1 percent cut to our revenues
 
07:30:57.670 --> 07:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
until things stabilize
 
07:31:00.468 --> 07:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
shouldn't i push the red button
 
07:31:02.150 --> 07:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:31:03.830 --> 07:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
jay i recognize representative major for
 
07:31:15.110 --> 07:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:17.430 --> 07:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:31:19.990 --> 07:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
if i know this bill originally proposed
 
07:31:22.388 --> 07:31:22.398 align:start position:0%
lowering the business profits tax and
 
07:31:24.468 --> 07:31:24.478 align:start position:0%
the business enterprise tax
 
07:31:26.868 --> 07:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
resulting in about 36 million dollars in
 
07:31:28.948 --> 07:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues
 
07:31:31.190 --> 07:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know the bill was amended to
 
07:31:32.468 --> 07:31:32.478 align:start position:0%
only lower
 
07:31:34.788 --> 07:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax from six seven
 
07:31:37.030 --> 07:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
point six percent to seven point five
 
07:31:37.040 --> 07:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
point six percent to seven point five
percent

07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:31:40.070 --> 07:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
which will lower the business taxes
 
07:31:43.030 --> 07:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
approximately eight million dollars
 
07:31:46.070 --> 07:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know this reduction in the beep
 
07:31:49.110 --> 07:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rate will be good
 
07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
for both the small and the large
 
07:31:51.760 --> 07:31:53.030 align:start position:0%
for both the small and the large
businesses

07:31:53.030 --> 07:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
07:31:55.190 --> 07:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore resulting in the most
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
important thing is keeping our economy
 
07:32:01.190 --> 07:32:01.200 align:start position:0%

services agreed
 
07:36:31.430 --> 07:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
250 feet is a distance that will protect

then would i agree
 
07:36:52.708 --> 07:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
that hb 1071 is a modest proposal that
 
07:36:54.670 --> 07:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
hits the sweet spot
 
07:36:56.548 --> 07:36:56.558 align:start position:0%

07:36:59.110 --> 07:36:59.120 align:start position:0%

individuals and small businesses with
 
07:52:00.628 --> 07:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
multiple electricity meters who generate
 
07:52:02.948 --> 07:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
their own energy to budget and avoid
 
07:52:05.350 --> 07:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
taking on unnecessary debt by allowing
 
07:52:07.190 --> 07:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
them to apply the credit generated on
 
07:52:10.230 --> 07:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
one meter to the bill on another meter
 
07:52:12.070 --> 07:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know that utilities already

administer these credits manually once a
 
07:52:15.750 --> 07:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
year meaning that this should not
 
07:52:17.830 --> 07:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
require substantial additional costs or
 
07:52:17.840 --> 07:52:19.510 align:start position:0%
require substantial additional costs or
complexity

07:52:19.510 --> 07:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
07:52:21.270 --> 07:52:21.280 align:start position:0%

belong to the customer generators would
 
07:52:40.230 --> 07:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
i now press the red button so that

for what reason to memorize mr speaker
 
07:55:04.948 --> 07:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion
 
07:55:08.468 --> 07:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
state your motion like the table
 
07:55:10.548 --> 07:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
it is a proper motion
 
07:55:13.910 --> 07:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is a motion the motion is a table
 
07:55:16.388 --> 07:55:16.398 align:start position:0%

are you ready for the question all those
 
07:55:23.190 --> 07:55:23.200 align:start position:0%

hb 1148
 
07:55:54.708 --> 07:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
if you if you heard the description
 
07:55:57.190 --> 07:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting governmental
 
07:55:59.590 --> 07:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
entities subordinate to the state blah
 
07:56:01.350 --> 07:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
blah blah
 
07:56:03.350 --> 07:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
what it really boils down to
 
07:56:04.948 --> 07:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
is saying that
 
07:56:08.868 --> 07:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
local towns and cities uh are unable to
 
07:56:11.190 --> 07:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
determine whether there are certain fuel
 
07:56:14.150 --> 07:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
types that will not be used within their
 
07:56:14.160 --> 07:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
types that will not be used within their
borders

07:56:15.350 --> 07:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
borders
 
07:56:17.830 --> 07:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
so the minority finds this to be an
 
07:56:19.910 --> 07:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
extremely disruptive bill to new
 
07:56:22.230 --> 07:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire energy planning
 
07:56:25.670 --> 07:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1148 not only removes local control
 
07:56:27.830 --> 07:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
for energy planning from those who are
 
07:56:30.230 --> 07:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
doing the work on town energy committees
 
07:56:32.150 --> 07:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
to help lower costs
 
07:56:34.310 --> 07:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
and emissions
 
07:56:37.030 --> 07:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
it voids decisions already made
 
07:56:38.548 --> 07:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
by towns
 
07:56:40.948 --> 07:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
who have adopted plans to eliminate
 
07:56:43.030 --> 07:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels from their municipal energy
 
07:56:45.910 --> 07:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
portfolios because the bill is also
 
07:56:45.920 --> 07:56:47.830 align:start position:0%
portfolios because the bill is also
retroactive

07:56:47.830 --> 07:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
07:56:50.070 --> 07:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is an about face
 
07:56:52.070 --> 07:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
in direction setting that walks back
 
07:56:55.270 --> 07:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
support for local clean energy efforts
 
07:56:57.830 --> 07:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
to implement a mandate that says new
 
07:57:00.230 --> 07:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire counties and towns have no
 
07:57:03.270 --> 07:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
authority to exclude an energy source
 
07:57:05.110 --> 07:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
can only be seen as paving the way for
 
07:57:07.910 --> 07:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
continued fossil fuel dependence
 
07:57:10.150 --> 07:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
this is not the desire of many towns who
 
07:57:12.628 --> 07:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
have already invested in moving forward
 
07:57:14.468 --> 07:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
with clean energy targets and i know
 
07:57:16.628 --> 07:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
because i live in one of those towns in
 
07:57:19.750 --> 07:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
my town hollis over eight years ago we
 
07:57:21.510 --> 07:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
did a benchmarking study of all our
 
07:57:23.830 --> 07:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings and then we began
 
07:57:25.990 --> 07:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
investing in converting maybe some of
 
07:57:28.150 --> 07:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
you have had the same experience some of
 
07:57:31.670 --> 07:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
your town buildings to pellet burners
 
07:57:34.150 --> 07:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
we put solar panels on top of the
 
07:57:36.468 --> 07:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and all of these have
 
07:57:39.110 --> 07:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
resulted in hundreds of thousands a year
 
07:57:41.430 --> 07:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
of dollars going down in our energy
 
07:57:42.628 --> 07:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
costs so
 
07:57:45.270 --> 07:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
we believe the minority believes
 
07:57:46.948 --> 07:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
we should have the right to do that we
 
07:57:49.030 --> 07:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
should have the right to lower our costs
 
07:57:51.910 --> 07:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and invest in which sources we want and
 
07:57:53.830 --> 07:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
if we want to set a target saying we
 
07:57:56.388 --> 07:57:56.398 align:start position:0%
will be fossil fuel free by 2050 which
 
07:57:58.548 --> 07:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
many towns in new hampshire already have
 
07:58:00.628 --> 07:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
we should be free to do that this bill
 
07:58:02.310 --> 07:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that
 
07:58:02.320 --> 07:58:03.830 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that
so

07:58:03.830 --> 07:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:58:03.840 --> 07:58:05.030 align:start position:0%
so
this

07:58:05.030 --> 07:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:58:07.270 --> 07:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is very much an issue of granite
 
07:58:08.948 --> 07:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
staters having greater control over
 
07:58:11.350 --> 07:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
their energy bills which we talk often
 
07:58:13.270 --> 07:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
is something we want
 
07:58:14.708 --> 07:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
creating savings through local
 
07:58:18.230 --> 07:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
generation hb 1148 disrupts orderly
 
07:58:20.788 --> 07:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
planning for many municipalities and
 
07:58:22.948 --> 07:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
defies our long-standing tradition for
 
07:58:25.510 --> 07:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
local control please oppose the ought to
 
07:58:29.750 --> 07:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:32.948 --> 07:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative platt
 
07:58:35.510 --> 07:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i thank the
 
07:58:37.350 --> 07:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues who came back
 
07:58:39.430 --> 07:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
from dinner tonight and i know you did
 
07:58:40.948 --> 07:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
it just to listen to my scintillating
 
07:58:40.958 --> 07:58:44.868 align:start position:0%
it just to listen to my scintillating
speech

07:58:44.868 --> 07:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:46.388 --> 07:58:46.398 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:58:47.910 --> 07:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
first of all has nothing to do with
 
07:58:49.510 --> 07:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
heating systems it was a senate bill
 
07:58:51.750 --> 07:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
last year which
 
07:58:54.150 --> 07:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
stopped municipalities from prohibiting
 
07:58:56.230 --> 07:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
any kind of heating system this is power
 
07:58:59.670 --> 07:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
production or conversion and contrary to
 
07:59:01.670 --> 07:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
the minority speaker it doesn't block a
 
07:59:03.430 --> 07:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
municipality from investing their own
 
07:59:05.830 --> 07:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
money and solar what it does do is keep
 
07:59:07.510 --> 07:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
them from
 
07:59:07.520 --> 07:59:08.788 align:start position:0%
them from
prohibiting

07:59:08.788 --> 07:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
07:59:11.430 --> 07:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
generation of any sort or throwing
 
07:59:13.830 --> 07:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the way of them changing
 
07:59:13.840 --> 07:59:15.430 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the way of them changing
zoning

07:59:15.430 --> 07:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
07:59:17.270 --> 07:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
power production has to follow local
 
07:59:18.948 --> 07:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
zoning unless accepted by the site
 
07:59:21.190 --> 07:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but
 
07:59:23.110 --> 07:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
but the ordinance that the town or
 
07:59:26.150 --> 07:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
municipality cannot change zoning to
 
07:59:28.948 --> 07:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
throw roadblocks in the way of uh
 
07:59:28.958 --> 07:59:30.070 align:start position:0%
throw roadblocks in the way of uh
production

07:59:30.070 --> 07:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
production
 
07:59:32.468 --> 07:59:32.478 align:start position:0%
so this is a state responsibility before
 
07:59:35.030 --> 07:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee any kind
 
07:59:35.040 --> 07:59:36.388 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee any kind
of

07:59:36.388 --> 07:59:36.398 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:59:38.468 --> 07:59:38.478 align:start position:0%
generation that's proposed
 
07:59:40.548 --> 07:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
is an automatic opposition from a lot of
 
07:59:42.468 --> 07:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
people no matter what it is it's not in
 
07:59:43.830 --> 07:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
my backyard
 
07:59:45.830 --> 07:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh or or it's uh
 
07:59:48.388 --> 07:59:48.398 align:start position:0%
ideologically driven but it is an
 
07:59:51.110 --> 07:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
automatic negative reaction some cases
 
07:59:53.270 --> 07:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
is positive site evaluation committee
 
07:59:55.190 --> 07:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the municipality can go there and argue
 
07:59:56.948 --> 07:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
for pro or con but it should be at the
 
07:59:58.788 --> 07:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
08:00:05.190 --> 08:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:08.070 --> 08:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us on house bill 1148
 
08:00:11.510 --> 08:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
is a majority report about to pass
 
08:00:13.830 --> 08:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
08:00:15.350 --> 08:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
will take their seats this will be a
 
08:00:30.468 --> 08:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:32.150 --> 08:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for everybody to
 
08:00:34.310 --> 08:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
take a seat
 
08:00:36.788 --> 08:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
i would remind members
 
08:00:36.798 --> 08:00:38.788 align:start position:0%
i would remind members
that

08:00:38.788 --> 08:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:00:41.190 --> 08:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiries
 
08:00:44.070 --> 08:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be short
 
08:00:45.990 --> 08:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
and to the point
 
08:00:54.788 --> 08:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:58.230 --> 08:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
we actually we have a form up here
 
08:00:59.830 --> 08:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
to tell everyone how to do a
 
08:01:01.750 --> 08:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
08:01:04.388 --> 08:01:04.398 align:start position:0%
they're getting way too long
 
08:01:06.070 --> 08:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
and way too involved in what a
 
08:01:08.468 --> 08:01:08.478 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry is supposed to be
 
08:01:10.310 --> 08:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm addressing it to both sides of
 
08:01:18.948 --> 08:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:20.708 --> 08:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
the question before us is a majority
 
08:01:23.030 --> 08:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass on house bill
 
08:01:25.990 --> 08:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
1148 this is a division vote the chair
 
08:01:28.310 --> 08:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative mcgee for a
 
08:01:31.750 --> 08:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:33.430 --> 08:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:01:35.750 --> 08:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
if i know that prohibiting cities and
 
08:01:38.788 --> 08:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
towns from saying no to any type of fuel
 
08:01:40.388 --> 08:01:40.398 align:start position:0%
means pulling the rug out from under
 
08:01:42.388 --> 08:01:42.398 align:start position:0%
towns with climate action plans who are
 
08:01:44.548 --> 08:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
doing great work to lower the costs of
 
08:01:47.110 --> 08:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers and if i know
 
08:01:48.628 --> 08:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
that this kind of reversal of
 
08:01:50.708 --> 08:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
long-standing state policy creates
 
08:01:52.468 --> 08:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
economic uncertainty
 
08:01:54.868 --> 08:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
and hurts the clean energy sector just
 
08:01:56.628 --> 08:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
as defunding new hampshire saves hurt
 
08:01:58.310 --> 08:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
the weatherization sector these are new
 
08:02:01.590 --> 08:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire jobs and finally if i know
 
08:02:03.590 --> 08:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
that this type of mandate runs counter
 
08:02:06.230 --> 08:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
to long-standing efforts to make new
 
08:02:08.388 --> 08:02:08.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire's energy economy competitive
 
08:02:10.788 --> 08:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
in the region and sends poor pricing
 
08:02:12.628 --> 08:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
signals to new companies looking to do
 
08:02:14.868 --> 08:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
business in the area
 
08:02:16.708 --> 08:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
then would i now press the red button to
 
08:02:18.628 --> 08:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
reject the ought to pass motion so that
 
08:02:21.190 --> 08:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
 
08:02:22.708 --> 08:02:22.718 align:start position:0%

if i know
that

08:02:31.590 --> 08:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:02:33.190 --> 08:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is not a home rule state and that
 
08:02:35.190 --> 08:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities should not
 
08:02:38.468 --> 08:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
be restricting types of fuels to use to
 
08:02:40.948 --> 08:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
their new residents and if i know that
 
08:02:43.430 --> 08:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
is the job of the sec to decide matters
 
08:02:44.548 --> 08:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
like this
 
08:02:45.590 --> 08:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
would i now
 
08:02:49.590 --> 08:02:49.600 align:start position:0%

usgnp by 10 percent over the coming
 
08:07:17.910 --> 08:07:17.920 align:start position:0%

08:16:36.150 --> 08:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
if i know this is a pi
 
08:16:40.070 --> 08:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:43.430 --> 08:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
if i believe that we are currently in an
 
08:16:45.030 --> 08:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
energy crisis
 
08:16:47.510 --> 08:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that we you the way we
 
08:16:49.750 --> 08:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
use and obtain energy
 
08:16:52.388 --> 08:16:52.398 align:start position:0%
is in transition and that transition is
 
08:16:53.510 --> 08:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
not over
 
08:16:56.468 --> 08:16:56.478 align:start position:0%
and the work of the oversight committee
 
08:16:58.468 --> 08:16:58.478 align:start position:0%
is far from over
 
08:17:00.468 --> 08:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
if i believe that
 
08:17:03.350 --> 08:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
we need a comprehensive
 
08:17:06.308 --> 08:17:06.318 align:start position:0%
study of all the reports that we get
 
08:17:08.868 --> 08:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
and all the information that we get
 
08:17:11.190 --> 08:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
and that we can't get that in committee
 
08:17:13.270 --> 08:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
many times
 
08:17:16.308 --> 08:17:16.318 align:start position:0%
i believe that we should continue with
 
08:17:19.110 --> 08:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee which does not
 
08:17:20.468 --> 08:17:20.478 align:start position:0%
hurt anything
 
08:17:23.590 --> 08:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this committee has
 
08:17:25.590 --> 08:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
not met
 
08:17:29.750 --> 08:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was due to covet
 
08:17:29.760 --> 08:17:31.590 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was due to covet
so

08:17:31.590 --> 08:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:17:34.150 --> 08:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
my information was that the
 
08:17:37.030 --> 08:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee had come out with an itl
 
08:17:39.270 --> 08:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
but i believe that this is an odd to
 
08:17:39.280 --> 08:17:40.468 align:start position:0%
but i believe that this is an odd to
pass

08:17:40.468 --> 08:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
pass
 
08:17:43.750 --> 08:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
it harms no one and it helps everyone
 
08:17:47.830 --> 08:17:47.840 align:start position:0%

a couple of terms ago
 
08:18:09.430 --> 08:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
but if i also know that the

restructuring process has been completed

[Music]
 
08:18:24.468 --> 08:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
a new bill was passed to repurpose the
 
08:18:27.990 --> 08:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee but its language was vague
 
08:18:31.510 --> 08:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
and didn't really do the job of defining
 
08:18:34.548 --> 08:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
what the new committee's role would be
 
08:18:36.388 --> 08:18:36.398 align:start position:0%
as a result the committee hasn't met for
 
08:18:38.628 --> 08:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
two or three years
 
08:18:41.510 --> 08:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
if i knew all that mr speaker would i
 
08:18:46.070 --> 08:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:48.070 --> 08:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill ought to pass as
 
08:20:25.990 --> 08:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:30.788 --> 08:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:32.948 --> 08:20:32.958 align:start position:0%

it is right

97 of them
 
08:26:45.830 --> 08:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and if i recognize that many areas of
 
08:26:48.708 --> 08:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
our state still do not have either
 
08:26:52.388 --> 08:26:52.398 align:start position:0%

horse by removing this vital safeguard
 
08:27:02.788 --> 08:27:02.798 align:start position:0%

the puc will be completing a four year

and the utilities is in fact on hold
 
08:59:14.070 --> 08:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
right now because of several problems
 
08:59:16.388 --> 08:59:16.398 align:start position:0%
but i also know that microgrids have a
 
08:59:18.150 --> 08:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
great potential in the future for
 
08:59:19.830 --> 08:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
community power and for rural
 
08:59:22.948 --> 08:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
communities to unite to create energy
 
08:59:25.270 --> 08:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
networks and i'd like to see more
 
08:59:27.990 --> 08:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
information and furthermore i know also
 
08:59:29.590 --> 08:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
now that there are several businesses in
 
08:59:32.230 --> 08:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
this state that are doing that so i i
 
08:59:34.070 --> 08:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
was requesting the department energy to
 
08:59:36.150 --> 08:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
put together a report of what we know
 
08:59:38.708 --> 08:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
right now about microwaves so we can go
 
08:59:42.230 --> 08:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and and and so i ask you to vote
 
08:59:45.030 --> 08:59:45.040 align:start position:0%

following resolution resolved that is
 
09:02:00.948 --> 09:02:00.958 align:start position:0%

09:03:02.548 --> 09:03:02.558 align:start position:0%

colleagues
 
09:03:19.110 --> 09:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill seeks to adjust
 
09:03:21.750 --> 09:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
net metering rates by removing all
 
09:03:24.388 --> 09:03:24.398 align:start position:0%
current charges ex that make up the rate
 
09:03:26.948 --> 09:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
except for the energy itself
 
09:03:30.388 --> 09:03:30.398 align:start position:0%
basically this bill says the wholesale
 
09:03:32.388 --> 09:03:32.398 align:start position:0%
rate of energy is what we should use for
 
09:03:33.830 --> 09:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
net metering credit
 
09:03:35.670 --> 09:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
but if i further know that this is not a
 
09:03:37.670 --> 09:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate method of evaluating the
 
09:03:39.750 --> 09:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
value of net metered energy
 
09:03:41.910 --> 09:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
and that a long pending public utilities
 
09:03:44.388 --> 09:03:44.398 align:start position:0%
commission's study on this very topic is
 
09:03:47.030 --> 09:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
due out any day to let us know what that
 
09:03:48.230 --> 09:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
rate should be
 
09:03:50.628 --> 09:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that it is
 
09:03:53.750 --> 09:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsible to knowingly
 
09:03:55.750 --> 09:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
create an adverse effect on existing
 
09:03:58.070 --> 09:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities and slow
 
09:04:00.468 --> 09:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
planned adoption of new projects by
 
09:04:01.990 --> 09:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
throwing this kind of wrench into the
 
09:04:03.910 --> 09:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
mix when there is no evidence that this
 
09:04:06.150 --> 09:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
arbitrary calculation is the right price
 
09:04:08.628 --> 09:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
point for a complex market
 
09:04:11.350 --> 09:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
then what i now press the green the red
 
09:04:13.350 --> 09:04:13.360 align:start position:0%

09:09:49.830 --> 09:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
09:09:51.350 --> 09:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
that there have been bills aimed at
 
09:09:54.228 --> 09:09:54.238 align:start position:0%
eliminating rex sweeping for years and
 
09:09:57.190 --> 09:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the last session we passed the bill
 
09:09:59.428 --> 09:09:59.438 align:start position:0%
the other body passed the bill
 
09:10:02.548 --> 09:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
but the governor vetoed it
 
09:10:04.708 --> 09:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
thereby violating the new hampshire
 
09:10:07.190 --> 09:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
constitution's guarantees of property
 
09:10:10.708 --> 09:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
rights protection due process and equal
 
09:10:14.310 --> 09:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
protection under the law
 
09:10:16.708 --> 09:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
and if i know that via rex sweeping the
 
09:10:18.630 --> 09:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is seizing the
 
09:10:20.310 --> 09:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
property rights of new hampshire
 
09:10:22.228 --> 09:10:22.238 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses
 
09:10:23.990 --> 09:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
without their knowledge
 
09:10:28.068 --> 09:10:28.078 align:start position:0%
and without any compensation
 
09:10:30.068 --> 09:10:30.078 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this practice has
 
09:10:32.228 --> 09:10:32.238 align:start position:0%
transferred millions of dollars from new
 
09:10:34.388 --> 09:10:34.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents and businesses to
 
09:10:36.310 --> 09:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
private corporations
 
09:10:38.388 --> 09:10:38.398 align:start position:0%
with roughly half yes going to the
 
09:10:40.150 --> 09:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
utilities and
 
09:10:43.350 --> 09:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
pennies on your rate going down but with
 
09:10:44.790 --> 09:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
the other half
 
09:10:46.388 --> 09:10:46.398 align:start position:0%
going to out-of-state private
 
09:10:49.030 --> 09:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
corporations like constellation energy
 
09:10:51.190 --> 09:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
and direct energy
 
09:10:53.190 --> 09:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
thereby placing the state of new
 
09:10:56.228 --> 09:10:56.238 align:start position:0%
hampshire in legal jeopardy
 
09:10:59.030 --> 09:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know that this bill
 
09:10:59.040 --> 09:11:00.150 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know that this bill
simply

09:11:00.150 --> 09:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
simply
 
09:11:03.748 --> 09:11:03.758 align:start position:0%
informs those customer generators who
 
09:11:07.030 --> 09:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
are being harmed and have been harmed by
 
09:11:08.388 --> 09:11:08.398 align:start position:0%
this practice
 
09:11:11.670 --> 09:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
of the fact of the taking and the means
 
09:11:14.228 --> 09:11:14.238 align:start position:0%
they can take to protect their property
 
09:11:16.150 --> 09:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
from further seizure
 
09:11:19.030 --> 09:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
would i now push the red button
 
09:11:22.228 --> 09:11:22.238 align:start position:0%
 
09:11:24.310 --> 09:11:24.320 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
09:11:31.030 --> 09:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the state
 
09:11:33.112 --> 09:11:33.122 align:start position:0%
created these wrecks
 
09:11:35.670 --> 09:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the state can also take them away
 
09:11:38.228 --> 09:11:38.238 align:start position:0%
but if i also know that these wrecks
 
09:11:40.388 --> 09:11:40.398 align:start position:0%
these unclaimed wrecks are used by the
 
09:11:42.708 --> 09:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
electric utilities to reduce your
 
09:11:43.990 --> 09:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
09:11:46.388 --> 09:11:46.398 align:start position:0%
and if i know that if we stop letting
 
09:11:48.630 --> 09:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
them use these unclaimed rates it will
 
09:11:50.868 --> 09:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
be raising your electric bill and if i
 
09:11:53.510 --> 09:11:53.520 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i've
 
09:17:28.310 --> 09:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
known i've seen this bill about three
 
09:17:29.908 --> 09:17:29.918 align:start position:0%
four times
 
09:17:32.470 --> 09:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
and and if i also believe and many of us
 
09:17:34.388 --> 09:17:34.398 align:start position:0%
here all of us here have taken the oath
 
09:17:36.708 --> 09:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
of the constitution knowing that the
 
09:17:39.350 --> 09:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
federal government take is deals with
 
09:17:43.190 --> 09:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
immigration so mr speaker if i believe
 
09:17:45.670 --> 09:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
that there's no way that we'd be able to
 
09:17:47.428 --> 09:17:47.438 align:start position:0%
get the information requested in this
 
09:17:49.908 --> 09:17:49.918 align:start position:0%
bill due to privacy and we do not have
 
09:17:52.790 --> 09:17:52.800 align:start position:0%

if i know
 
09:18:14.548 --> 09:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
that it is clear that we have much
 
09:18:16.630 --> 09:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence about the impacts of
 
09:18:19.030 --> 09:18:19.040 align:start position:0%

09:18:37.830 --> 09:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
reputable data on a statewide level to
 
09:18:40.470 --> 09:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
inform public policy that leads to the
 
09:18:43.350 --> 09:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
best economic and humanitary outcomes
 
09:18:46.068 --> 09:18:46.078 align:start position:0%

honorable colleagues
 
09:22:37.586 --> 09:22:37.596 align:start position:0%
i rise today to offer an amendment
 
09:22:39.190 --> 09:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
located in your seat pockets if you'd
 
09:22:40.710 --> 09:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
like to read along
 
09:22:42.950 --> 09:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
to house concurrent resolution 7
 
09:22:44.870 --> 09:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for the nation
 
09:22:46.710 --> 09:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
of israel and the location of the
 
09:22:48.710 --> 09:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
embassy therein
 
09:22:51.110 --> 09:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
what my amendment seeks to do is make
 
09:22:53.990 --> 09:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
this resolution less controversial by
 
09:22:55.426 --> 09:22:55.436 align:start position:0%
removing the section relating to the
 
09:22:57.990 --> 09:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
moving of the embassy to jerusalem and
 
09:22:59.830 --> 09:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
by adding a section about supporting the
 
09:23:04.390 --> 09:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
israel israeli-palestinian peace process
 
09:23:06.630 --> 09:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
the moving of the embassy to jerusalem
 
09:23:08.870 --> 09:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
was a very controversial one
 
09:23:11.670 --> 09:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
as jerusalem is claimed by both israel
 
09:23:13.350 --> 09:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
and palestine
 
09:23:15.030 --> 09:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
the united states should not be picking
 
09:23:17.350 --> 09:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
aside in this decades-long conflict and
 
09:23:19.110 --> 09:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
should serve instead
 
09:23:20.950 --> 09:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
as a neutral arbiter
 
09:23:23.350 --> 09:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
the united states cannot be considered a
 
09:23:26.150 --> 09:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
neutral arbiter if it is picking a side
 
09:23:28.950 --> 09:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
on who owns jerusalem
 
09:23:31.746 --> 09:23:31.756 align:start position:0%
secondly it adds after the section about
 
09:23:34.470 --> 09:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for israel and i
 
09:23:34.480 --> 09:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for israel and i
quote

09:23:35.350 --> 09:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
quote
 
09:23:37.266 --> 09:23:37.276 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire general court
 
09:23:39.190 --> 09:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
recognizes the right of the palestinian
 
09:23:41.426 --> 09:23:41.436 align:start position:0%
people to exist and that the new
 
09:23:43.830 --> 09:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court supports the
 
09:23:43.840 --> 09:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court supports the
israeli-palestinian

09:23:45.510 --> 09:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
israeli-palestinian
 
09:23:47.746 --> 09:23:47.756 align:start position:0%
peace process
 
09:23:50.070 --> 09:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
now i believe that every member in this
 
09:23:53.190 --> 09:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
house can agree that we support peace in
 
09:23:55.030 --> 09:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
the middle east and for a peaceful
 
09:23:57.190 --> 09:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
resolution to this conflict
 
09:23:59.746 --> 09:23:59.756 align:start position:0%
this is why i asked for a roll call so
 
09:24:02.230 --> 09:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
that we can see who stands for peace and
 
09:24:03.990 --> 09:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
who does not
 
09:24:05.830 --> 09:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that if this amendment were to
 
09:24:08.150 --> 09:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
pass that we would pass this underlying
 
09:24:10.470 --> 09:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
resolution unanimously
 
09:24:12.550 --> 09:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
that is why i ask for your support on
 
09:24:14.710 --> 09:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
this important amendment and to please
 
09:24:19.030 --> 09:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
09:24:23.426 --> 09:24:23.436 align:start position:0%
 
09:24:25.030 --> 09:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
some of the branches requests that are
 
09:24:28.630 --> 09:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
all calls that sufficiently seconded
 
09:24:30.470 --> 09:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be

it's merely a
 
09:25:14.150 --> 09:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
clear restatement
 
09:25:16.710 --> 09:25:16.720 align:start position:0%

now
 
09:25:22.390 --> 09:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
for decades essentially since shortly
 
09:25:23.670 --> 09:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
after the founding of the state of
 
09:25:27.190 --> 09:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:29.350 --> 09:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the move to the embassy
 
09:25:31.190 --> 09:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
was voted by the congress of the united
 
09:25:31.200 --> 09:25:32.310 align:start position:0%
was voted by the congress of the united
states

09:25:32.310 --> 09:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
09:25:33.670 --> 09:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
09:25:35.190 --> 09:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
under several administrations and
 
09:25:36.630 --> 09:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
finally was implemented under the trump
 
09:25:36.640 --> 09:25:39.190 align:start position:0%
finally was implemented under the trump
administration

09:25:39.190 --> 09:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
administration
 
09:25:41.586 --> 09:25:41.596 align:start position:0%
before the embassy and before israel
 
09:25:44.390 --> 09:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
took back control of jerusalem
 
09:25:46.630 --> 09:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
in the 67 war when it was under the
 
09:25:48.870 --> 09:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
control of jordan
 
09:25:50.550 --> 09:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
the three religions that called
 
09:25:52.950 --> 09:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
jerusalem a holy site
 
09:25:54.870 --> 09:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
were not all allowed
 
09:25:54.880 --> 09:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
were not all allowed
access

09:25:56.790 --> 09:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
access
 
09:25:59.746 --> 09:25:59.756 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:02.630 --> 09:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at this amendment
 
09:26:05.510 --> 09:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
it basically guts the underlying
 
09:26:08.470 --> 09:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
resolution completely
 
09:26:11.266 --> 09:26:11.276 align:start position:0%
for a peace process to work
 
09:26:14.070 --> 09:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the parties involved in the conflict
 
09:26:16.710 --> 09:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
all the parties involved in the conflict
 
09:26:18.470 --> 09:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
must want peace
 
09:26:23.266 --> 09:26:23.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:25.190 --> 09:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is not the case with the so-called
 
09:26:27.350 --> 09:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
palestinian people
 
09:26:27.360 --> 09:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
palestinian people
they

09:26:28.470 --> 09:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
09:26:31.030 --> 09:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
their principal spokesman
 
09:26:33.110 --> 09:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
are from a designated terrorist
 
09:26:36.310 --> 09:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
organization called hamas
 
09:26:39.510 --> 09:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
hamas has in its charter
 
09:26:41.426 --> 09:26:41.436 align:start position:0%
its goal of the destruction of the state
 
09:26:42.790 --> 09:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
of israel
 
09:26:44.550 --> 09:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
fails to recognize the right of the
 
09:26:47.110 --> 09:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
state of israel to exist
 
09:26:49.426 --> 09:26:49.436 align:start position:0%
controls the gaza strip
 
09:26:51.670 --> 09:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
from which it builds underground tunnels
 
09:26:53.906 --> 09:26:53.916 align:start position:0%
to infiltrate terrorists into the state
 
09:26:55.350 --> 09:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
of israel
 
09:26:57.426 --> 09:26:57.436 align:start position:0%
rains rockets down
 
09:27:04.150 --> 09:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:05.746 --> 09:27:05.756 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend stage
 
09:27:05.756 --> 09:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend stage
appointment

09:27:06.950 --> 09:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
09:27:09.990 --> 09:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
stage a point of order i believe uh the
 
09:27:12.950 --> 09:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
member uh unfairly generalized a whole
 
09:27:14.710 --> 09:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
09:27:17.586 --> 09:27:17.596 align:start position:0%
into a one terrorist organization
 
09:27:19.990 --> 09:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's fair there's
 
09:27:25.426 --> 09:27:25.436 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:27.030 --> 09:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's a matter of fact that
 
09:27:29.350 --> 09:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
the hamas is the principal spokesman of
 
09:27:32.710 --> 09:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:32.720 --> 09:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

09:27:33.990 --> 09:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
09:27:36.150 --> 09:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
hamas hamas's
 
09:27:36.160 --> 09:27:39.586 align:start position:0%
hamas hamas's
hamas

09:27:39.586 --> 09:27:39.596 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:41.426 --> 09:27:41.436 align:start position:0%
hamas statement
 
09:27:43.190 --> 09:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
which has been repeated
 
09:27:45.670 --> 09:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
which has been repeated publicly
 
09:27:48.230 --> 09:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of months by a member
 
09:27:50.070 --> 09:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
of this very house
 
09:27:51.350 --> 09:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
from the river
 
09:27:54.310 --> 09:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
to the sea palestine will be free
 
09:27:57.426 --> 09:27:57.436 align:start position:0%
and that means that they want to push
 
09:27:59.990 --> 09:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
all the jews out of israel into the
 
09:28:03.586 --> 09:28:03.596 align:start position:0%
mediterranean kill the jews that's what
 
09:28:07.190 --> 09:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
they want so that's what this amendment
 
09:28:08.710 --> 09:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
will stand for
 
09:28:10.470 --> 09:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i urge you
 
09:28:19.390 --> 09:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:34.390 --> 09:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:36.630 --> 09:28:36.640 align:start position:0%

i think it's all gotten out of water
 
09:28:49.586 --> 09:28:49.596 align:start position:0%
it's not debatable excuse me i apologize
 
09:28:53.350 --> 09:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:56.150 --> 09:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
