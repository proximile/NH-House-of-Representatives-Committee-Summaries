00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
um um representative germana has just um
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
passed out some amendments to us that we
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
can look at I know there were some
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
emails that were sent recently from
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative Penza and commissioner
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
whims we can discuss briefly um and then
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
also um chairwoman Ain has some
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
questions she's is not able to attend
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
right now but she might be here any
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
moment but I've um I've got some
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions of hers written down that I'll
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
ask um but before we get to that um
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
let's start off with um representative
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
Penza um if you have anything to say
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
about your work and what you've got
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
great uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
um everything has um been put into place
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
all of the changes that I had sent out
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
from the draft are all are all in so um
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of I'm going to go
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
through them they're better on my
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
computer than they are on the dra on the
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
draft real quick while you're looking
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
that up when you say the draft do you
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
mean the um the um copy that you handed
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
out uh a week or so ago that has a kind
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
of different type face it doesn't look
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
quite like OS but is drafted like OSS is
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
that what you're referring to the one
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
with the lines struct yeah yeah yeah
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
that has all been applied here in
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
this this is an unapproved draft you're
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
happy that everything that was in that
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
draft did make it into this amendment
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
correct everything I spent was here
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday looking line by line to make
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
sure that it was all done uh correctly
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
as well okay I'll just blast with the
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
real quick questions while you're
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
looking that up the Ford Act is that in
 
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.749 align:start position:0%
looking that up the Ford Act is that in
or

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
out the what act the Ford Act is that in
 
00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.269 align:start position:0%
out the what act the Ford Act is that in
or

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
out uh that is still in I believe um you
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
had mentioned previously you wanted to
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
get rid of that um do you have a reason
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:43.749 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah lines it's it's on lines page
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
three lines 15 16 17 I just kept it in
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't it wasn't in my first
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
round that came afterwards and it since
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
yeah it here nor there it doesn't it
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
didn't make it didn't seem to make a
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
difference so I just kept it there it's
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
it's two lines okay it's law so okay um
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
next question uh 10 theg5 or 10 the4 10
 
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.150 align:start position:0%
next question uh 10 theg5 or 10 the4 10
to

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
theg5 okay and any reason why you kept
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
that instead of switching to the ne4
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
which you had mentioned previously
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously that that was um um
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's not my decision and I didn't hear
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
anybody telling me to do it and um 10 to
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
theg5 was what how the rules first came
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
out um
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
and yeah they're um they're more
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
protective and it's it's where we should
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
be at it's still um a lot weaker than
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
many other states surrounding so if I
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
may ask representative germana how you
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
feel about
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
that yeah I believe it should be 10 to
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
the negative five okay okay you don't
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
feel that's uh too restrictive to get
 
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.909 align:start position:0%
feel that's uh too restrictive to get
past

00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
or anything like that well when we uh
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
spoke with uh the department last year
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
when we were going through these bills
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
we have never been offered any evidence
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence that 10 to the neg5
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
is unworkable okay okay good and then
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
one quick question and I'll be done on
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
my end um does aquafer have any sort of
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
a definition if not in this in this bill
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
than in statute that we can link to
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
because there's concern the chairwoman
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
had some concern that aquafer is a
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
little too vague um and that um you know
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's a real definition of
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
aquafer it's not necessarily any any
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
body of water any stream of water so any
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that yes so every time there
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
was aquafer listed um it basically went
 
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.990 align:start position:0%
was aquafer listed um it basically went
to

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
um existing aquafer drawn drinking water
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
Wells so pretty much every place that it
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
talks about an aquafer it then goes into
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
um aquafer drawn drinking water wells so
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
every single place that is referenced to
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
that except for like in the statement of
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
purpose it basically says in here
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
um drinking water sources our
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
environment including drinking water
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
wells per likes so
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
um when it was like in a in a general
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
general you know statement of purpose or
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
description but in every place where
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
it's talking about specifics it also it
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
always says Aqua for drawn drinking
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
water yeah so it sounds like it
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
qualifies that word a little bit um I'm
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
not a I'm not a legal scholar so I don't
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
know if that would be a problem or not
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
what are you what are your thoughts
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative J J well yeah I mean that
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
change makes sense to me my concern is
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
looking at the draft now uh page one
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
line 24
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
does say to any existing aquafer comma
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
drinking water well comma perennial
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
river so that didn't get changed to
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
aquafer drawn drinking water well which
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
is a different thing so that appears to
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
remain as yeah in two places OS did not
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
put that there and then in two other
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
places they did um she said it was
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
um um grammatically
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
so I didn't fight with her yesterday on
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
it so I can tell them that I wanted
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
exactly how I worded it it was exactly
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
how it was sent to all of you so there's
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
two places that say that so um to be
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient located sufficiently close to
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
any existing aquafer drinking water well
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
that they she split it yeah it does it
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
seems like very different things there
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's like and so that's where I'm
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
concerned I'm I'm just wondering if
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
there is I don't know but if there is
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere in statute that we can link to
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
that defines what an aquafer is or if
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
not if we can put a um I mean I'm not an
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
expert on that stuff but if we could put
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
a definition of what an aquafer is um in
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill so that you know there's no
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
there's no um there's nothing because
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
the thing is is we we all really want
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to go through but I'm my my
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
fear is uh and maybe the fear of
 
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Aaron is that if there's some
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
sort of legal hangup that just caus a
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
problem um one thing I will say is we're
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
not going to exec this today um we've
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
got one more week before we have to act
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
on it so if there's any little things we
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
can flesh out we definitely should do
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
that I can I please yeah
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
so that definition is an aquafer is a
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
body of permeable Rock which can contain
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
or transmit groundwater so that's what
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
do you have be honest it shouldn't be an
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a problem in having that
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
in here like that but it can I can just
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
force OSS to go back to what I um what I
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
said I mean of course you're not going
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.669 align:start position:0%
said I mean of course you're not going
to

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you're not going to be digging and
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
putting a landfill in an area where it's
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to transmit in the groundwater
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
because groundwater is what goes into
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
the drinking water wells so I mean it's
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
just basic water science yep
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative gerana anything to say
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
yeah could we ask the director to uh if
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
is have you been able to should I phrase
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
the question for you or have you been
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
able to piece it together from I think I
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
followed the discussion yes for the
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
record Mike whimet director of the waste
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
Dees um yeah I this issue of the use of
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the term aquafer in the bill is
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
something that I believe I commented on
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
the first time the at the first hearing
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill and and my sense is that
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
you know I and I think what I tried to
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
convey then and um I think is important
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
to understand is that virtually all of
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is underlaying by an
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
aquafer of some sorts we're blessed with
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh relatively per permeable soils and
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
relatively um uh fractured bedrocks so
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
that almost anywhere you want to if if
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
an individual residence wants to sink a
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
well and you know to install a well and
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
get enough water for one home they can
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
do it um that's not true for major
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
public water supply Wells you have to
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
look more carefully to site those
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
because you need much higher yields for
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
like a water system but as
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative Penza correctly pointed
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
out the term acfer is very broad it
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
basically says any formation that can
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
produce water and again you know in your
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
first level hydrogeology class when
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're studying this this particular
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
subject you learn that aquafer is in the
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
eyes of the beholder if if you know I
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
have a well in Bedrock the Bedrock under
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
my house is pretty competent I had to go
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
several hundred feet to get water but I
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
got it and I got enough for my house so
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
for me that's a bedar aquafer so I I
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
think that it's a
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
little with respect I think it's
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
Troublesome to use the term I don't know
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that it really adds anything to the the
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill and if you use that term it is so
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
broadly read that you could conclude
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
that you can never site a landfill
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere because virtually everywhere in
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could be considered an
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
aquafer follow yeah please I just want
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
if I would follow up in your
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
estimation does the phrase aquafer drawn
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
drinking water well is that more
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the text than the word
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
aquafer I would say it's redundant um I
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
think you could just say a drinking
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
water well because if there's a well
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
there and it's a drinking water well
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's clearly completed in an aquafer
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly okay all right thank you uh
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh Penza yeah I agree um
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
it was just trying to be specific in
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
there and so um and it made it easier
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
because any time there was the aaer I
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
had that in there so um I believe it's
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
two places where um that was done so I
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
think there's um we can make these are
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
very minor changes we can make that so
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's consistent throughout so what a
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
lither say um you know drinking water
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
wells and it doesn't need to necessarily
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
say aquafer at all in any place
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill so um do you have
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
extras of these yeah could you give one
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
to the director please
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay um real quick um do representatives
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
Gruber or uh Scully have anything they'd
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
like to ask or add
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
well well thank you Mr chair I I did
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions so on line uh
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
page three lines 18 to
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
24 um this section has in my mind some
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
very subjective Lang wording um
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
significant history uh
 
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.070 align:start position:0%
significant history uh
serious

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
violations and uh I'm wondering if that
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
is too broadly worded or too open to
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation whose decides what's
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
significant whose decides what's serious
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
um It also says continued will full
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
non-compliance or unpaid fines I could
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
see situations where there would be
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
certain um companies that perhaps a fine
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
is levied against them and they wish to
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
contest it I'm wondering how we um
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
because maybe they think it's
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or unwarranted and so this
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
type of language in my mind would mean
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
that they're guilty until you know
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
proven innocent so I'm I'm a little
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
troubled with this this whole section I
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we can tighten up the language on
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
that um the on that same page lines one
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
123 I'm assuming there's a u practical
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
reason why that's been put in there
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
maybe it is just that you need to have
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
somebody there all the time I don't know
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe you know a landfill of any
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
size is going to have that done I my
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
question would be why why it's put in
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
there why it's needed um there was one
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
other thing well the only thing I'm I'm
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
really concerned about I I get the
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
five-year distance of travel estimate I
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
think that okay so now we're putting in
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
something that uh would give a
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to detect and perhaps do
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
something about it um the 1500 ft now
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're back to doing something very
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
prescriptive uh in terms of saying you
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
can't have it within that distance and
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going with a 5-year time of
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
travel there could be certain scenarios
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
I could imagine where you could be
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
within 1500 feet and still satisfy the
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
fiveyear um distance of travel estimate
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I I I'd like to really discuss why
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're deciding on both a Performance
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
Based criteria and a prescriptive one
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Penza
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to respond to that yes so
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
for the first question uh the reason why
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
is because that's how it currently is in
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
our in the rules and so it's basically
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
whichever is um is more protective so um
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
everything was supposed to be site
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
specific and that's not how the current
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
rules reflect that so um those are the
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
changes that are made just from that 500
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
is not enough so um that's why it's gone
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
up to, 1500 it was at 3,000 which when
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
the first map came out cuz I think
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important um you know when
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
when this first map came out um this was
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
based upon 3,000 and we still had uh
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
approximately um 45% of the state where
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
we could where you could still site a
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
landfill um yes of course you saw a lot
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
of blue but I think that that's very
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
important to note because um and now I
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
don't even know what that percentage is
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
so um in any case let me go back to so
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's why it's like that in regards
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
with setback in time of travel um lines
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
on page three lines 18 through
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
24 um that has already been buttoned up
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
like extremely buttoned up it was like
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
three paragraphs long that was
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:00.190 align:start position:0%
um um
very

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
um restrictive in regards with like
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
fines and all of that kind of stuff this
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
means that you have to have you have to
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
be a significant violator at that point
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
and who the um and who polices this
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's that would be the that would be
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
the department so um they're the ones of
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
course that are that are approving
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
permits or not and so already if you
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
look look
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
at lines 22 to 24 that's already part of
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
their permit application you can't have
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
an active lawsuit or anything like that
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
so that's already part of where they
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
would be denying a permit so that's a
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
given and then the yeah and then the the
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
top is basically I took you know two
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
paragraphs of information and brought it
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
down and I wanted it to be you know
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
where you know sign significant history
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
of repeated serious violations uh you
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
know because of course violations happen
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
they get fixed that happens all of the
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
time we're talking about you know
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
someone that's an abuser and so and I
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
think that it just um if if you feel
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
like that would need to be tightened up
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
if um if director whims looked at this
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
and and had concerns then I um you know
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
I would definitely make some changes
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
here but um I worked this really I
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
worked this a lot to try to make it so
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
it wasn't um where it could be frivolous
 
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
it wasn't um where it could be frivolous
so

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that explanation I
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
would be interested to to hear what
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
director whimet has to say about that
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
language and then up at the top the last
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
question that you had in regards with
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
having at least one employee contracted
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
um power outages of course I they have a
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
dialer system this has been talked about
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
in um on the other side of the aisle
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not necessary we are
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
talking about a a an operation that
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
makes millions of dollars there needs to
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
be a person on site because if the power
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
goes out and that dialer doesn't work
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
which has happened we have had where
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
there is a spill that goes on over the
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
weekend and we don't you don't find out
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
about it until Monday so so from that
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
last you know last person on site on
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
Friday until Monday you could have three
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
days of incredible amounts of an
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
accident and that's it should not be
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
much at all um to have asking for one
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
live employee on site okay um we need to
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
speed things up thank you so much for
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
the um answers and explanations I do
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to let um representative grber um
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
have his say though thank you very much
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
um and thank you uh representative
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
Potenza for all these changes um the few
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
areas that I had concerns with with um
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
is the the aquafer issue and that's been
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed with drinking water
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
well which is great um also moving
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
towards the Performance Based system
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
with the five years before it could get
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
off site is I think it's really a great
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
way to deal with this because there's so
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
many variations of soils rather than a
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptive distance and including that
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
10 mile radius with the that landfill so
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm satisfied with where we are now
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you and then
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
um one last thing for everybody does
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else they'd
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
no I just I just want to U mention that
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it is possible we could either do that
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
now or during um a work session later
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
when everybody's here so that's I'll
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
leave that up to director whims if you'd
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
like to speak now or wait until the uh
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
work session it's at comm's pleasure I'm
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
happy to answer the representative's
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
question if he has one uh representative
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
senzu would you prefer his response to
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
be now or later it's totally fine I
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
think it's fine did you have a chance to
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
just read the paragraph okay yes I think
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
I understand what and I guess so I'm
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking at page for the record looking
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
at page three lines 18 through 24
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
correct which set out some uh
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on permitting for certain
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
violations and and and other conditions
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
I guess the first thing I would say you
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
know again we're not taking position on
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm asking I'm answering
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
because I've been asked um but but I
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
think director could you or pull it for
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
sure sorry about that um so on the lines
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
22 to
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
23 it just occurs to me that it isn't
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
always under the control of an
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
individual whether they're involved in
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
litigation anyone can file a suit for
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
any reason and so to say that a permite
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
could not be or an applicant could not
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
be granted a permit because they
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
involved in litigation it seems to me
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's disadvantaging an applicant for
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
something that they may not be able to
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
control so that's the only observation I
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
would make about that and then um with
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
regard to lines 18 through 19 where it
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
refers to um not issuing a permit um for
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
any applicant that has been found to
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
have significant history repeated
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
serious violations I certainly under
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand the intent
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
there and as representative Penza
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
correctly pointed out would be the
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
agency that would be implementing this
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
provision not entirely clear to me you
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
know where the break point is for
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
significant history of repeated
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
violations because these facilities are
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
complex it's possible to to commit
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
several violations over several days
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
when in fact the the the the applicant
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
may be making best efforts to to resolve
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
things um so I'm a little the only
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
concern I would have about that is how
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
we would decide in the event of an a
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
particular application where there was
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
some compliance here history what
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
constituted a significant history of
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
repeated violations and beyond that I
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have any observations on
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you Mr um thank you
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
director whimet I I agree with you I
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
think that the I think that the um the
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
agency has they have their purpose right
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
so of course there's a balance uh you
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
know um Department of Environmental
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
Services of course is first and foremost
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
to be protecting um you know the
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
environment here for all of New
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then of course we still
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
have to have a balance with industry and
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
all of that I get it I think that I
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
trust the agency to be able to make that
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
um um you
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
know those decisions especially where
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know let's say it's a new actor not
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that we already have a history
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
of that's working here in the state that
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
has a horrible track record with the
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
environment having that in there gives
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you that discretion I think that's
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
important the second piece of that um
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
is the landfill related litigation I can
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
make that more specific because I know
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's already part of the permit right
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
now so I just want that I want that um I
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
want that in in basically in rules so
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
however that could be worded to be more
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
specific about what where it's pretty
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
much an automatic Denial on your part
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
right now um I wanted that to mirror
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
that so if that's not um that would be
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
on starting on line 22 so if that's not
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
as clear I'd be happy to clean that up a
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
little bit I thought it was enough
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
because it was you know landfill related
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
litigation but I can make that that can
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
be very more a lot more specific
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I do want to point out and
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee is aware there
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
are a couple Provisions in law and in
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
rule right now that that go to this one
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
of them is that we're not to approve a
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
permit unless or we to deny a permit if
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
we determine that an applicant does not
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
have the requisite expertise reliability
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
and integrity to operate a solid waste
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
facility that's in the rule um so we do
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
Implement that presently and then uh
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
also with regard to litigation
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
applicants required to sign a compliance
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
statement so um part part of that would
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
be if they are if there's an outstanding
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
administrative order against the
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
applicant then they need to demonstrate
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
how they're going to be in compliance
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
with it that they are either in
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
compliance with it or that if they are
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
not that they're that by virtue of
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
receiving an approval for the
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
application they would be coming they
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
would come into compliance with that
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
order so there are some Provisions that
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
that they're not they're not identical
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
to these but I don't want to tell you
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
that but there are some Provisions in
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
law and rule that that go to this
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um with that being said I
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
think now would be a good time to wrap
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
it up um I'm real happy with the work
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's been done and um we've got some
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
good stuff we can tell during the work
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
session so with that I'll close the
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%

discussion on HB
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
424 directing the Department of
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food to create
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
forms for businesses to request
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
information about service animals and
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
protection of business owners from
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
requests to accommodate customers with
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or untrained service animals
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
we had this hearing last
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
week uh would anybody like to open
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about about uh this bill and
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
heard representative wheeler good
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
morning morning Madam chair and thank
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
you for opening up the discussion I
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
think this bill presented a problem that
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed but I'm not sure
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
that the legislature I'm actually
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
positive that the legislature can't
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
address this issue because of conflicts
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
with the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the federal level obvious obviously
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
those conflicts I think are a little
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
silly and the specifics around the
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
service dogs weren't well thought
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
through when that legislation was passed
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
leading to some of the problems that
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
were brought forward by the testimony
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
but other than potentially a study
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee and given the speaker and the
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
Senate presidents and the
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
leadership's directive around study
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
committees and wanting them not to move
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
forward unless absolutely necessary I'm
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
not sure this is the bium for a study
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee so I think given the only way
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature could move forward on a
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
policy like this is to have a study
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee that hones in hour after hour
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
as to specifics around what the
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislature could potentially do I I I
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that this legislation works
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if a study committee
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
given the as I said leadership's
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
directive around study committees is the
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
right way to move forward so maybe I
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
sadly representative string is a friend
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
of mine an itl for this legislation but
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
I I think that might be the right way to
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
move forward that's my piece I tend to
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
agree with you thank you representative
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um I think that uh I I
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
might um pose the issue of the problems
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
with trying to do a study committee a
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more strongly which is that I
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
think if we did a study committee we
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
would just find out what we already know
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
right now which is that we can't do
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
anything so I
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair uh there was
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
also discussion um before about
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
potentially um sending some sort of a
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
letter or house resolution to our
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and I'm I'm wondering
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
is that something that this bill could
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
be amended to do or is it something
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
would be better for him to just you know
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
we it itl this and then next year um
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
maybe representative Stringham and
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
um well hold on one sec um I I believe
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
what we would need to do is itl this
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill and um representative Stringham is
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to um write a letter
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the delegation or you know we can
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
also uh write a letter to the
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
delegation um in tandem to that I mean
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do anything
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
legislatively it's just represent Penza
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I think I
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
offered to draft up something
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
specifically and um I've already started
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
that so I would be happy to do that and
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and then it could be worked on by of
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
course our committee and then and then
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
sent out um a letter specifically to the
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
federal delegation U pointing out some
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
of these issues I also think it's very
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
important for us to lean
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
on uh all of the tools that we currently
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
have the communication that comes out of
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
the um the disability um office out of
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
the governor's office so the commission
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's really important as well
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
um those notices are are very important
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
too I think telling people um what their
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
what questions they can ask and what's
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
what their rights are for for businesses
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's all very important as
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
well as um always protecting that
 
00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:57.630 align:start position:0%
well as um always protecting that
community

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
um as well so you don't um I think that
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
education is the key and there's been a
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
lot that's been done already um I think
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of making sure that
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
we can utilize all those resources but I
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
think a letter um is is a great thing
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
saying hey can you guys button this up
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
on the federal
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
side yep
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
agreed any other questions or comments
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to to uh represent
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
Bixby support the idea of the committee
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
sending a letter I think that's the
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
that's a relatively low overhead
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
approach to it rather than having to to
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh put in a a whole resolution and then
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
go through the whole um Bill LSR Bill
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
Etc Pro process on it because I think I
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
think that we we have the information we
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
need and a lot of from our committee
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
agreed okay uh no further discussion on
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
hb250 um we had a a um subcommittee
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
meeting on that bill and came out with
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
some language which I submitted to OS on
 
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
some language which I submitted to OS on
Friday

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
and I just got um the amendment back for
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
hb250 and unfortunately they inserted
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
the wrong Bill language into that
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I'm just now sending a
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
letter to O an email to OS to fix it
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
because they've mixed up the two bills
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
that were in OS so uh 250 hb250 will not
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
be um available for us to exec today
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
until they fix this um but basically um
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
what we had for um the
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
Bill let me just pull up
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
with okay let's see so while she's
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
looking for that I can just sort of give
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
a little sense of the logic behind it uh
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
what we heard in the hearing was there
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
was a concern that allowing a the
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
communities the general ability to
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
regulate everything about musling might
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
open it up to uh uh laws that
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
um uh ordinances that would uh regulate
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
specific require musling of specific
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
breeds and uh also musling of um of
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs and uh those were we saw
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
that both of those were potential
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
problems what we did was we added some
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
language uh referring to uh the
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
definition of a uh vicious or um un
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
vicious or whatever there are three
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
terms there uh dog that that are it's
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
already defined in statute and saying
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
that musling that they can make
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh for dogs uh that are
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
deemed to be uh vicious under this
 
00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:35.109 align:start position:0%
deemed to be uh vicious under this
statute

00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
number yep um so what we what we
 
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.990 align:start position:0%
number yep um so what we what we
changed

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
was the language okay uh the language
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
that they had here was uh adding in to
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 466 colon 39
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
city or town bylaws the local governing
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
body may make such additional bylaws and
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulations concerning the licensing
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
they added the word
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
musling into and restraining of dogs as
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
it deems
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable and may a fix penalties etc
 
00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:16.799 align:start position:0%
etc what we changed was instead of
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
inserting the word musling we inserted
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
the words musling of vicious dogs as
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 466 colon 31
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that way we are restricting this uh
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
their ability to make any additional
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
bylaws and regulations regarding the
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
musling of vicious dogs and there's a
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
definition of what that is so it makes
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more clearer a little
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
bit more restricted um but also gives
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
them the the ability to do that and
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the the amendment is and
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I had hoped to get back from
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh OS this morning however that didn't
 
00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh OS this morning however that didn't
happen

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
so um I am sending a letter out to um
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney esbach to see if they can
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
straighten that out maybe we can have
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
that done today I don't know but if
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
not um both this bill and the bill they
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
mixed it up with we will recess those uh
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
or this bill was supposed to be exec
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
today on the list um we will have to
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
recess that till next week to have exact
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
out so that's where we are on hb250
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
none moving on to HB
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
262 relative to group licenses for
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
dogs uh any questions or comments about
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
Weekes I take this sure um so uh from
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
previously looking at the group dog
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
license statute
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'm aware that there is a a
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
certain amount of disparity in terms of
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing fees uh
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
so um the licensing fee for if you have
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
you can have a group license if you have
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
five dogs or more uh if you have three
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
or four dogs the sum of the fees for
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
those dogs will exceed the amount of
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
money that it that it costs to get a
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
group license for uh five dogs to
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
infinite number of dogs uh and uh so my
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
initial thought was that this bill might
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
address it uh the bill was a mess it
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sort of numerical sense
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the the bill sponsor didn't show up
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
to uh explain what was going on or offer
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
anything any sort of resolution uh I
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the work the kind of
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
work we need to take on as a committee
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
even if we think that it might be a good
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
idea uh so I think this is just an
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
comment seeing none and and I agree with
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
your assessment representative Bixby
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
welcome uh we heard last week also hb401
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
relative to animal testing funded by New
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State funds would anybody care
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
to make any comment about that uh
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative German
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
germana either way either way thank you
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair I I just want to
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
say very quickly this seems to me the
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
very definition of a a a solution in
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
search of a
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
problem um I don't think there's
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
any reason to believe that we need to do
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
this and so absent that I can't see
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you I know know that
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
um uh we have a federal Animal Welfare
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
act that um our facilities have to
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
comply with and um I think that that
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Animal Welfare act also takes
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
care of what this bill is trying to
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
address representative Freeman thank you
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and I and thank you for
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
that stal and M Thunder thank you very
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
much while I wasn't physically at the
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
hearing I did watch it and um I I was
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
struck by the fact that no one could
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
come up with any clear answers about if
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing animal testing in New
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is this a problem so given
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
that I I couldn't support legislation
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
that again as representative Jama stated
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
is you know a solution looking for a
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
problem so again if this becomes a
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
problem in the state naturally we should
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
address it but I don't think at this
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
time that would be prudent and in so far
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
as um animal what cosmetic cosmetic
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
testing I in New Hampshire the only
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
Cosmetic Company I know of is Badger and
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
I know that they are absolutely uh
 
00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
I know that they are absolutely uh
cruelty-free

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
cruelty-free
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
company so okay uh any other question or
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
comment representative King thank you
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I think the most
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
interesting part of this bill was was
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
um was the recordkeeping requirements
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
the idea that if there is any animal
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
testing that they need to
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
sort of alert the house or the the
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
Senate um I'm not too concerned about
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
the animal testing because like was
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
brought up in public hearing we don't
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
really know if that happens but when it
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
comes to just regular animal testing I I
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
personally would be shocked if there
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't something like that going on in
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
the biology department or some
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
Department of one of the universities I
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
mean when I was at University you know I
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't I didn't do it personally but I
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
visited these labs and you know there's
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of animal testing going on so it
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
would be I suppose nice to know if that
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
was happening in the state of New
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we had a way to look and
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
figure out and kind of at least at least
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on and and then
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
worry about if we want to do something
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
about it unfortunately you know a lot of
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
this bill contains stuff that you know
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
like uh representative germana said is
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a pro a solution in search of a
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
problem um I I would hope that if we do
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
itl this that maybe the sponsor will uh
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
bring it back another year and and
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
narrow down the focus to just learning
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
more about what sort of animal testing
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
is going on in the state and then maybe
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
doing something about that and not not
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
have so much language specifically just
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
about um product testing which may not
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
even be happening thank you
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative um Bixby yes so uh as it
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
stands right now excuse me as it stands
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
right now um any
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh institution that is getting Federal
 
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.150 align:start position:0%
uh institution that is getting Federal
money

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
for uh doing uh research that involves
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
animals uh is required to have an
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
Institutional Animal Care and use
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the proceedings of the animal
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
care and youth committee are public
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
records and you can request uh
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
information from the IU of any of any uh
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
institution that's doing research that
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
involves animals uh and uh and that you
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
know that is available as a public
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
public record right now I don't know uh
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
exactly you know whether there's already
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
website that is up that sort of lists
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
everything that they're doing but um
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
that that is public that is public
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
record it is available right
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you representative Bixby
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
any other representative
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair um I had an
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
extensive conversation with
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
the some of the people that were here
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
testifying sponsor co-sponsor um
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
and although I I like the idea of of
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
saying not New Hampshire and I there's
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's that piece um I don't I think
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
coming to the committee I think it was
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
very important for them to at least have
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
basic information and that information
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
is available so for example any single
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
um even private business here uh
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
Corporation in New Hampshire that is
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
doing any sort of animal testing at all
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
um they have Labs all of that stuff has
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
to be licensed so I said have you you
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
know go to DHHS find out whoever is
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
doing not necessarily for any product
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
testing but whatever kind of testing
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
that they might be doing um and that
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
would include of course you know the
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
federal piece with the university stuff
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's easy to get that kind of
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
information in regards with the federal
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
stuff so I recommended that they would
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
do that immediately and get that kind of
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
information to say okay well there we
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
know for fact there's 10 facilities that
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
are doing animal testing on X Y and Z
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
that would be really good information to
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
have that the committee would have so I
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
I asked them to follow up with that type
 
01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:18.829 align:start position:0%
I asked them to follow up with that type
of

01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
information um you know I know we do
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
pass bills that make a statement um the
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism I don't agree with
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
either I don't think it kind of makes
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
sense um but I do um it would be nice to
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in New Hampshire so
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this bill is ready for
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
prime time yet I think that I think we
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
need the data and it would be really
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
nice to have that kind of information
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that's something that
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh the bill uh sponsor
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors would be willing to gather
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
that and provide that to the committee
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
um to move forward with something if
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I don't think there's a
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem with saying hey we don't want
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire there's many other
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
states it's um it's um as our as the kid
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
Governor came here and and testified as
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
well um you know we don't want any sort
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
of uh unnecessary product testing on
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
animals there's a lot of companies that
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
are very much against that of all that
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
ethical treatment and um so it'd be nice
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
to have a statement but I think it just
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
has to I think there has to be more work
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
done in this space and just more
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
research and information that we could
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
Howard um I thought that we that our
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
researcher did a pretty exhaustive
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
search right to to find any evidence
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that that was out there so and I
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
think that also in the testimony um they
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
they had also done research so I really
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
think that it's not it's not it's making
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
a statement about something that's just
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
not happening would be sort of a waste
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
of our time so thank you representative
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
Bixby so I think that some of the laws
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
that are in other states uh
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
restricting uh Cosmetics that have been
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
tested on animals uh is uh I think that
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
what that is done is What's Done in
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
those States or at least some of them is
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
to have a ban on sales of products and
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
that would which would essentially not
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
make it you know just something that's
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
produced in the state but something
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's produced in another state but
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
sold into the state and there are third
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
party organizations that certify
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
products as being not tested on animals
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
Etc um if another bill that had this
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
general purpose was to come forward I
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
think that it would it would make more
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
sense to look at those other states that
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
have a banon sales and do it in terms of
 
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
a sales a sales ban rather than a um for
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
things that are tested on animals rather
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
than trying to figure out what's being
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know how the animal testing might be
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire or not uh and
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think that that's also a bill that
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
would probably end up going to Commerce
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
rather than us so uh so which which
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
means that which also means that we
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't amend this bill to do that because
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
we had another bill that would have
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
moved it into Commerce territory last
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
year and we weren't allowed to do that
 
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.309 align:start position:0%
year and we weren't allowed to do that
so

01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other question or comment
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
regarding this
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
bill all right seeing none I think we're
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
going to move
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
on um the next bill is HB
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
616 relative to the confiscation of
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
animals from persons suspected of or
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
charged with abuse of animals um we had
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
testimony from our hearing we had um
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
input from
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
various uh parties on
 
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.190 align:start position:0%
various uh parties on
this

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
and so just represent Bixby yeah so um
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
the the incorrectly produced uh
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment does that actually have the
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
most current language for 616 in
 
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
it I haven't looked it over but it looks
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
like it does okay so it might make sense
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
to pass that out with the caveat that is
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
in that in in fact not the right bill
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
number but it will give us the right
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
stuff to discuss yeah so if we want to
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
talk about it sure so let me uh let me
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
way

01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah give one to uh the commissioner
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
um Madam shair yes are you
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
gonna if we have any extra copies please
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
back so we're not voting on this
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
today um
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
but I want everybody to see we had
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated changes that um the
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner has requested as well
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
as changes that uh from
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh I mean we can can kind
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
of give you a moment to look through it
 
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
and if you have any
 
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
and if you have any
[Music]

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
questions we
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
sure representative King you have a
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um on
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
page two uh lines 17
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
um it says no confiscated animal shall
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
be altered prior to conviction and I'm
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we're going to be able
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
to have any sort of language that would
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
also deal with euthanization you know I
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
know that they it was claimed that you
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
know if an animal had been seized and
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
was suffering that they would euthanize
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
it um which seems very drastic to me I'm
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there was anything
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
that could be done to protect against
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
that as I understand part of being Al
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
alteration represent Penza just a quick
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
question on that
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
um was that already
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
in um 17 line 7 page two lines 17
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
through 19 was that in the original or
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
is that part of the amendment I'm trying
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
to remember if the no confiscated animal
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
shall be altered prior to a conviction
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
for abuse or neglect under this section
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
without the notorized authorization of
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
the owner from whom the animal was
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
confiscated was it worded like that in
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
the original or was
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
that well that wasn't in there at
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
all it was not in there at all okay
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
because I know we talked about that's
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
where I have a oh represent King I'm
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
sorry uh Madam chair um are you happy
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
with the language that OSS has done or
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there is still any more
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
work that needs to be done or changes
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be made to what
 
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.749 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be made to what
they've

01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
they've
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
done I think this looks fine uh in in so
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
far as uh incorporating the uh comments
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
that we've had from the commissioner and
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau uh as well as um uh you know
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks from uh the animal
 
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
folks from uh the animal
protection

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
section um representative ktoa thank you
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
Ma Madame chair I'm just looking at um
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
one uh line 13 um and I was just
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if that could be clarified it
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
says no animal shall be confiscated
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
unless a person is charged under this
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
under the section in line 14 except when
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
the officer believes that the animal's
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
life is in
 
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.590 align:start position:0%
life is in
danger

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
danger
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so my question is is do they have
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
sole discretion there does a
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian have to be called in
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't look like that it
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
just says except
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
when so I'm I'm I just want a little bit
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
of clarification on that line if I could
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
please okay so the line above it uh
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
indicates that an investigating officer
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
would be accompanied by a state
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or their design Who Shall
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
Set probable cause criteria so I would
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
imagine that um the uh investigating
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
officer would have someone with them to
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
advise them as to whether the animal uh
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
the animal's life is in danger or not
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
I understand that but it does say accept
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so that is where I'm questioning
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
that the accept is in cases I guess of
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh protective custody um commissioner
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up and perhaps
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
clarify that or suggest where we may add
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
some language or
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
something thank you madam chairman
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I think you do
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
have to give the officer that discretion
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
and he would have to justify at a later
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
time why he believed the animal's life
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
was in danger we you are not going to be
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to get the state V veterinarian or
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
his design 247 365 days a year there are
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to be times and there even if
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
somebody was going to come say from two
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
hours away if he was in a situation
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
where he believed that that animal's
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
life was in imminent danger I don't
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
think any of us would want to want to
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
say oh well just leave them there to die
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
without the exception language that is
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
doing um so that's why I suggested that
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
language recognizing there are going to
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
be extenuating circumstances the officer
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
would have to justify later why he
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
believed that to be the case
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you madam chair
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
commi commissioner when when you were
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
just speaking you said a key word there
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be important
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
imminent and I think that really needs
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
to be put in there um would you have
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
objection no I I certainly don't have
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
any objection and and Madam chairman
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
while I'm at the table I I think that in
 
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
the drafting of this amendment
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
everything REM uh relative to the
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
paramutual and the racing is um no
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
longer in the amendment would stay in
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
law so if you just double check on that
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
because there seems to be something
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
there unless I'm missing it but I will I
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay hold on one
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
second and you wanted to include say
 
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.310 align:start position:0%
second and you wanted to include say
imminent

01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
danger okay um representative
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam shair so line 14
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
will go I just wanted to clarify so
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
believes that the animal's life is in
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
imminent danger perfect and then
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
is there a way to connect the two so no
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
animal shall be confiscated unless a
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
person is charged under this section
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
except when the officer slash you know
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
um um State veterinarian or their design
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
believes that the animal can you
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
qualify um the officer with the vet in
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
that or is that just automatically known
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
because it's mentioned previously I
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
think it's mentioned previously
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
I think there are actually two as
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
aspects to that one is it's because it's
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the sentence right before that that
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
this they're doing it under the advice
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's fairly clear the other is that in
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
terms of actually making the
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
determination it has to be the law
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer because the State
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
Vet does not have that's right has that
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Authority Poli policing Powers
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
so it's on it's page two
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
um lines 20 21 and
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
22 uh I think that um the changes here
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
are great there I think that's missing
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
one piece um there is
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
so besides a um soliciting of donations
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
if if no one has been charged with a
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
crime and an entity that was involved in
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
in confiscating animals is is putting it
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
out there on their website or social
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
media basically um convicting that
 
01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
person which causes threats and all of
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
these other things that happen um you
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
know because of course it's the court of
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
public opinion is there any way to have
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
a sentence in there that's not just
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
solicit donations
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
but correct that are basically you know
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
um convicting these owners and puming
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
these owners before they were even
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
charged or anything like that like
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
before I don't know I just that to me is
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
just as
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
bad I mean it was clear that um the
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
situations that we heard and I've heard
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
of others of the level of threats that
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
came from Outsiders in the community was
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
horrible I mean it'll destroy people's
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and livelihoods docks of
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
family that's just not okay especially
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
if there was no conviction nothing was
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
was set in stone there's no you know to
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
try to protect that while du process and
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is going on nobody
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to take investigative
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
information put it online and then have
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
the public go after them with pitor
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
works right so actually there is another
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
section that addresses that which is on
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
page three line
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
18 uh in order to protect the Integrity
 
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
of a complaint of complaint
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%

01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
basically uh that that basically gets it
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
about yeah um representative Scully well
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
well thank thank you madam chair this is
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
definitely going in the right direction
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
um so is there any functional difference
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
between confiscation of an animal taken
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
into protective custody I see the words
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
used you know in confiscation in one
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
place in protective custody in
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
another so as I understand protective
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
custody is a more immediate action where
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
the animals are taken right away this is
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the case of if the um if the owner is
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
not around or not home
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh confiscation so protective custody is
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
a form of confiscation let's put it that
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
way okay may I ask one other question
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
please yes um I now again I have to read
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
this again uh carefully but I did have a
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
question um I don't know if we have any
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh regarding allowing the
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
comp the person who files the complaint
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
from also participating in the
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
investigation whether that would uh
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
constitute a conflict of interest that
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
14 oh wonderful thank you for pointing
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
y representative
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
germana thank you madam chair CH chair
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
pardon me gosh I can't get rid of this
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
cough um so I have a question about page
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
two lines 17 to 19 that representative
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
Penza referred to earlier and this is a
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
process question I'm just trying to to
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
Think Through I understand the purpose
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh of this section so no confiscated
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
animal shall be altered prior to
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
conviction I you know I think there's a
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
consensus that euthanizing an animal
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
fits under you know that term altered
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
but here's my question thinking about
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
the how long it can take to get a
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
conviction of somebody and if we're
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody of course someone
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
is not guilty until proven uh or is not
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
yeah guilty until they're proven
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
innocent but if if there is an animate
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
if if they're yeah well I'm saying that
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
they're not presumed guilty right so we
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
can't assume that but if you have a case
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
where an animal as judged by maybe it
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
could even be a couple of different
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
veterinarians or whatever if an animal
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
is in really really bad shape I would
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
hate to think that an animal would have
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
to continue suffering throughout the
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
entire length of proceedings until a
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
conviction is secured and you may have a
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
case of legitimate abuse where an animal
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
is really really suffering and by the
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
time you get to conviction conviction
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it could be many weeks or
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
months so I don't know if it's possible
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
I hate the idea but I'm a little that's
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
what concerns me is that we may have
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
animals who are deeply suffering and if
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's a way to say that maybe two
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians or whatever might concur
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
that euth in Asia is an appropriate uh
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
step to take that's my only concern it's
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
not about assuming anyone's guilty it's
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
just a concern for an animal who may be
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
really suffering and may have to suffer
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
for weeks or months represent ktoa thank
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think when we're
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with animal cases the court
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
hearing has to be expedited so um they
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
get a quicker court hearing than you
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
know just you or I um you know we have
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
that is in our rsas that they have to be
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard very quickly so that then a judge
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
is already involved within I think it's
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
7 to 14 days all right thank you very
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
much help representative uh Bixby uh
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
just a a caveat about that and and I
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
think that maybe the um commissioner
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
might want to weigh in on this because I
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
think he might know this a little bit
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly than I do but um I
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
believe that there what is required
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
within 15 days is a status hearing and
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
that does not actually uh establish uh
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't establish the con the final
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
conviction and just as a way of figuring
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
out what should be happening with the
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
animals uh and I'm not sure what the I I
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since I've really
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
looked at this carefully so I'm not sure
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
what entirely is covered under the
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
status hearing could you clarify that
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner I don't have any particular
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the status here and what I
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that once an animal is
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
seized the original owner is no longer
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
in charge of that animal we have the
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
cost of care fund which has criteria set
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
out for how much money that we can
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
expend for that animal and I don't have
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
all of it in in front of
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
me my my understanding is that if an
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
animal is suffering and is not in a in a
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
position where we can uh relieve that
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
suffering the animal will be euthanized
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
because at that point it is not anyone
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
else's property it has become the
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
property essentially of the state and so
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
it animals are not allowed to suffer in
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
in that situation the animals that we
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
can care for during that period and can
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
be you know rehabilitated if necessary
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
will be but animals that are in in a
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
state of suffering would be euthanized
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
and in this paragraph too it also says
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
that um you would have to get notorized
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
authorization from the owner so if the
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
animal is suffering and they want to
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
euthanize it they
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
would talk to the owner of the animal
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
and I would
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
imagine proceed with getting the
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
notorized authorization to do so
 
01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.030 align:start position:0%
notorized authorization to do so
represent

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I think that uh what you just
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
said is key because from listening to
 
01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.510 align:start position:0%
said is key because from listening to
the

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
testimony um with some of the animals
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
that were put down that weren't
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily um um in distress they were
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
only in distress because you know they
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
they they didn't have were nursing that
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so I think that the piece
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
there that you're talking about um is
 
01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.790 align:start position:0%
there that you're talking about um is
important

01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
because maybe that is where a solution
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
comes in where I can take care of my
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
animals you don't need to euthanize them
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so in regards with
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
notorized so um there was another
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
question that representative Scully had
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to answer that um I'm
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
not sure if you were part of the hearing
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
where the protective custody piece so
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
for example um I didn't realize this too
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
that sometimes if somebody's sick an
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
owner could die or something like that
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
and the animals are left in home that
 
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
that piece there that protective custody
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
so I know they're sometimes used
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
interchangeably but where the like the
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
department or law enforcement is coming
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
in to take animals sometimes it's just
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
because you know God forbid the owner
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
could be in a car accident or something
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
like that could happen so then the
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
animals are taken care of fed and things
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
like that not home um alone and that
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
kind of piece so there's that part of
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
that type of protective custody where
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's just unforeseen circumstances that
 
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.430 align:start position:0%
it's just unforeseen circumstances that
take

01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
place okay represent King thank you
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'd like to get back to the
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative germana raised
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
because I think it is an important one
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know the answer we just kind of got
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
was that well you can get authorization
 
01:24:56.189 --> 01:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
from the owner but that assumes that the
 
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
owner has the animals welfare in mind if
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's if it's an abuse case the animal
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
the owner might not give the permission
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
because he was abusing the animal
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
anyways and so just let it keep
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
suffering so that is a problem I I I see
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
I thank you for bringing that up um and
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
then um in regards to this uh the
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner sort of answered um in a
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
legalistic way as far as who has custody
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious um a lot of the changes
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing in this amendment my
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they were done
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
with um input from the commissioner so
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if the commissioner had
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this line and if so
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
what his thoughts are on it not from a
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
legal necessarily point of view but just
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
from a practicality point of
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
view thank you and if I if I may when I
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
gave the answer I wasn't thinking of new
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
nine I was aware of it I don't fully
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
support this because the owner the
 
01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
support this because the owner the
previous

01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
owner has had that right taken away from
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
him but if the committee feels strongly
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
about this then I would implore you just
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that you heard to add
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
except in the case of a court order
 
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
because obviously um these animals were
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
not well cared for and you're exactly
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
right that somebody may say no you know
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
you you continue to deal with them so I
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be the opportunity
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
for uh the state to move forward and say
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
this animal needs to be put down for its
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
own own welfare and so representative
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
Bixby so
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure if you have the answer
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
to this uh right in front of you but um
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
so in current law uh after the um after
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
there's been that status hearing uh
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a uh line five in so um so Roman
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
3A on number five is no custodian of an
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
animal confiscated under under this
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
section shall spay or neuter or
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise permanently alter the
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal in his or her customy
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
custody pending the final disposition of
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
the case unless a treating veterinarian
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
deter determines that such procedure is
 
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to save the life of the animal
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
so that's current law does uh line n
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
here replace that or is it added to that
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
I I am not sure um you know as I said
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not the biggest fan of of uh section
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
nine I think that you know the current
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
law probably covers that and frankly I
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
was not thinking of the altered
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
including youth in Asia um I certainly
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
see how that could be interpreted that
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
way so again if you're going to leave
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and that's the interpretation let's
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
not make something else subject to
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
debate because we know although the
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee may feel that way you end up
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
to court and you know could be well you
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
know euthanasia is not altering the
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
animal it's euthanasia but uh right so
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
so so in in terms so you think that in
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
terms for clarity we should add
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
euthanasia specifically there and we
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
should also add something about a court
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
order potentially being uh an
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
alternative if
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
the owner is being really uncooperative
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it's really medically necessary I I
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
would agree with that yes thank you
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you madam
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
chair I'm wondering can we hear from
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
maybe Chief suckling from Alexandria or
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
Sheriff fright from bellnap I know
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
they're here I wonder if they have
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
something to add to this conversation
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
sure please have a seat and introduce
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%

name is Dave suckling I'm the chief of
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
the Alexandria Police Department thank
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
you very much for the mild introduction
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the governor's Commission of
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
the Humane treatment of animals I'm
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
currently getting appointed to that I'm
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
in the process of that but I've been
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
appointed that by the New Hampshire
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association and and I
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
speak also for the New Hampshire Chiefs
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
of Police Association while I'm here
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
today uh we we oppose this bill and and
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
I can go through why
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
um we just got handed the new one so I'm
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
a little on the back foot with us this
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
morning but I will tell you a few things
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in animal cruelty
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
cases since the day that I started in
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement there's only one thing
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
more emotional than law enforcement and
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's probably domestic violence people
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
are very passionate about their animals
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
and I understand that completely and and
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
because that people also don't see the
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
degradation of their animals that that
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
we see when we arrive on scene for the
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
first time um I've worked livestock
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
cases I've worked um animals uh cats and
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
dog cases I've I've worked a lot of them
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
and you guys were asking before about
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
the process through the courts and how
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
it takes a long time um I'll just
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
highlight a case that we did uh several
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
week uh two weeks ago probably I think
 
01:30:12.669 --> 01:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
now um we took a dog from from a house
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
we were there to serve some paperwork on
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
the owner and the dog came out of a
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
kennel and it was terrible it was a rot
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
wheeler it was about I I don't know 20
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
30 lbs underweight we seized the dog
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
immediately on the spot it had no water
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
it was living in 10° and minus
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
temperatures um it's pretty apparent to
 
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
us pretty quickly what a what a abused
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
dog looks like or an unfair dog looks
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
like um we seized the dog um we didn't
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
arrest the person at the time which is
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
contrary to what you guys are suggesting
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill and there's a reason for
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we're a small Police Department
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's two of us and our job that day
 
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.189 align:start position:0%
there's two of us and our job that day
was

01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um so this bill is dealing mostly
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
entirely with livestock so I don't know
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
where it's coming and and can
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative kto has a question for
 
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
you yes you mentioned that you are
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
working on getting appointed to the
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
Humane commission but are you testifying
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
on their behalf because no I'm not I'm
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
just telling you that I've been
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
appointed to that by the Association no
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely not but my my point was
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
I've been appointed to that by the
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
chiefs of Police Association that was
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
right but I just want to make sure that
 
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
everyone on in in the on the committee
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
and in the audience knows that you are
 
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
not speaking on behalf of the commission
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
no I'm definitely not thank you okay
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
anybody has a question for um can I talk
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
about an animal cruelty case that I did
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
that was livestock if you'd rather me
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
talk about that because it's it's
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
relevant it's very relevant to what
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about you're talking
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
about seizing animals um without an
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
arrest being made we've done that many
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
times and we have to sometimes because
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're such a small agency and most of
 
01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.390 align:start position:0%
we're such a small agency and most of
the

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
agencies yeah representative Freeman yes
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair while I appreciate um uh the
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
chief coming in front of us I I do
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a work session and
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
not a hearing so I I think we need to
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
keep within those parameters in order to
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
find a solution I would love to ask the
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
chief any questions and I think there's
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
many on this committee who would like to
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important that we stay
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
along those lines yes I agree and um so
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
certainly if anybody has any questions
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed your name uh Chief
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
David sackin you can call me David fine
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah Chief David sackin um please we can
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
ask them now representative
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so you
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to read the um the
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
changes that were made I had read the
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
one before today I'm not sure which
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
version that was and I apologize for
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
that but I haven't read much of the one
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
today so my question is can you give a
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
spefic specific example of where um you
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
think there are some problems with this
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
bill from an experience so let's say you
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
just said you had a a livestock um
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
experience um so it specific speaking
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
directly to the bill where do you see an
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
inherent problem right now um one of the
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill that I see a problem
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
and I and I think it's in the new part
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
like I said I've just had 10 minutes
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
with it um is assuming that there's a
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
theft if we take an animal without
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
charging someone that's hamstringing us
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's really I I think you guys
 
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
are looking for law enforcement to be
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
involved in in animal cruelty and I
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
think that's almost threatening in a way
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
to us that that if we don't arrest
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
someone at the time then that could be
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
considered unauthorized taking I I we
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't like that okay representative
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair I'm
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
wondering thank you Chief suckling for
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
coming before us thank you does the
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
language in the first section line 14
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
around except when the officer believes
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the animal's life is in danger does
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
that at all alleviate any concerns that
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
you or your organizations have around
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
not being able to have the discretion
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
you need in these cases where I I think
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
that works for us generally speaking it
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
gives us some exent circumstances that
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
we can work around yes so it might if I
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
could Madam chair sure it might move you
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
from being opposed to this Bill to maybe
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
being neutral and not taking a position
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a small part of a
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
larer bill I would say this part of it
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
adequate representative kto you had a
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
question no you're good representative
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um so to I
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
actually had the same point as as
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler but I also um I
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
also wanted to comment that the
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
difference between that the last bill
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
and this one is that the big gap that
 
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
got closed was in precisely the lines
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about um and and so
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
you might want to take a closer look
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
because I think that I had the same
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
problem that you did before that there
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
was there seem to be some steps missing
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
and some and and some things that were
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
out of order and I really think that
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
these lines uh solve that problem okay
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir thank you for
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
having me we uh so I as I see it in
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
lines 17 to 19 on page two regarding
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
confiscating animal uh no confiscated
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
animal shall be altered prior to
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
conviction for abuse Etc that
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
section needs some work so we'll have to
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
work on that represent
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
Penza so um based thank you madam chair
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
based upon what the commissioner stated
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to put words in your
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
mouth wherever he is
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
um that can be fixed in in regards we
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
can keep that and the wording can change
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
by just adding um a court order
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
basically a court order would Trump um
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the in a sense the notorized
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
authorization correct that's what I was
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
hearing from that
 
01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.830 align:start position:0%
hearing from that
okay

01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Scully thank you
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah yes speaking to that
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
that uh Clause I would say in case
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
except in the case of a court order no
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal sh be altered I think
 
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see or euthanized in there
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
just so there's no um how would one say
 
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.990 align:start position:0%
just so there's no um how would one say
it

01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh ambiguity that's the exactly the word
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much uh I would
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
point out I think this is very important
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
because if somebody was being charged
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
with animal cruelty I could see them
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
withholding authorization to euthanize
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
an animal because they might consider
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
that proof of the fact that they were
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
conducting animal cruelty so the court
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
order is a very important um addition
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Howard neena oh
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
you you had your hand up I'm sorry thank
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I'm not going to
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
take it personally that I put my hand up
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
a half dozen times sorry it is what it
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
is people don't look over this this way
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
um I what what I'm hearing my apologies
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
no no not necessary um what I think
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
might help us address that issue with
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
euthanization is um on line 31 page one
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
no custodian of an animal confiscated
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
under this section s spay on no authoriz
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
permanently alter the confiscated animal
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
in his or her custody pending final
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
disposition of the court case unless a
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
treating veterinarian deems such a
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
procedure necessary to save the life of
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
the animal or in the case of emminent
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
suffering euth in Asia so that might
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
address what our concerns are about it
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
make it a little cleaner and a little
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
more succinct thank
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
you so you would add in the words or in
 
01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:13.589 align:start position:0%
you so you would add in the words or in
the

01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
case okay got

it represent Howard thank you madam
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
chair I'm a little bit confused by
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
getting authoriz notorized authorization
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
from the person who has has um committed
 
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
the you know negligence or or abuse in
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
order to you know in order to take these
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
next steps um so I'm I'm just wondering
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
if that's the person that we need to
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to get the final word
 
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.149 align:start position:0%
that we need to get the final word
from

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:46.990 align:start position:0%
from
well

01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representative kto you had a i
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
comment I I did um based on on what uh
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative Howard was saying because
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
as we know we just had a case um where
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
animals were
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
confiscated um and you
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
know if someone doesn't know the owner
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't notorized that and sometimes the
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
owner understands the animals better
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
and so I I'm a little concerned about
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
that but I think with the cleaning up of
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of this it will help mitigate that
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
portion of it but I think it's important
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
to note that um except in like as
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative rman said extreme
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
suffering um you know the owner should
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
have a say
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
because we're innocent until proven
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
guilty um and we have to go under that
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
assumption if we're going to follow the
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
law but represent vix and then Penza so
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
um I think one thing that is still a
 
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
unclear uh is the difference between
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
confiscation and uh and protective
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
custody and uh as the as the both both
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
as it stands in current law and as it is
 
01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is written they are
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
distinct things but it is but it is not
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
actually defined anywhere really
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
outright this is what confiscation is
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
versus this is what protective custody
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
is I think we might want to include in a
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
definition section in this chapter uh a
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
definition of custody uh protective
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
custody and a definition of confiscation
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
just so that is that is really clear
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
when it's being read
 
01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
when it's being read
because

01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
um when when an animal is taken into
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
protective custody it is not yet it is
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
not yet confiscated uh it is still
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
um there there the uh so the
 
01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.430 align:start position:0%
um there there the uh so the
um

01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
so uh under uh in in section two unless
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
charges have been filed or this is lines
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
33 and 34 on line on page two unless
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
charges have been filed or a warrant
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
establishing probable cause has been
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
issued the animal or animal shall be
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
returned to the owner or their design or
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
caretaker upon request
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
so that you so at that point uh if there
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
is then if charges are then filed
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
or there's a warrant for probable cause
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
that at that point the protective
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
custody gets converted to
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
confiscation and which is which ties
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
into what's happening in
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
um in on page three in uh uh line 24 the
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
confiscation of any animal or animals
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
without a charging of the owner or
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
without or caretaker or without a
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
warrant specifying probable cause under
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 shall be theft uh by
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking so uh that's that's
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
where the um we where there needs to be
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
so the the common sense understanding of
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
confiscation is different from what is
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
actually happening in the law I think
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
having some definitions uh at the
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of the section might help
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you madam chairman I
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
am very much afraid you are going to
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
make perfect the enemy of of good or
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
however that phrase goes when we had our
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
meeting months ago that's when I
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
suggested there are a lot of problems in
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
this section that we need to have a
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
study committee but there are things
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
that are very important now and I think
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm not a a big fan of
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
putting nine or 10 in even at at this
 
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
particular time I think we you need to
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
focus on fixing the problems and you
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
just heard from the the chief and
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
clearly that's where the problem was in
 
01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:17.719 align:start position:0%
in Lee they don't understand that you
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
can't seize an animal now without um
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
filing charges
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
and that the protective custody even
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
though not as well defined but in your
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
fix does Define it better it always said
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
you you know you have to leave the
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
notice where they can you don't do that
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody is there and so I think it
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
was always clear in the
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
law um to most people that that was
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
there but now we get into these
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
definition this should be the purpose of
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
the study committee all these other
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
tangental issues should be what you put
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the study please I'm I'm imploring
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
you to fix the problems that exist now
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't try to fix everything now or you
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
are going to lose this maybe not in the
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
house but you send it to the Senate and
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to lose it and
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're just going to go with the study
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee we need fixes that happen now
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
I just would say please keep keep the
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
fixes simple
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay sure just question I I think that I
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your thoughts on that and
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
I think that this could in fact wait for
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
the study committee y represent Penza
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I still think
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to have um you know I did
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
another bill definitions I think are key
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
so having certain things um defined in
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
there so for example so we wouldn't have
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
to places where it talks about being
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
altered um that includes of course
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
euthanasia so I think having those types
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
of definitions in there are important um
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
not having you know taking the
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner's point you know if we're
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to leave some things out because
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's we're trying to bite off too much
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
at this point I get it but I I think
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
that having um right out in the
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
beginning some definitions is is really
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
helpful and it also helps to um have
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
less words so if if altered means all of
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
those things then you don't need to say
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and we already know that it means all
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
of those things but I think it's it's
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
good to have those definitions that are
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
in there thank you representative King
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh with all du
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the commissioner I
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree I think we're
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
really close on this to be honest and I
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
feel like I mean I'm not the one doing
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
the heavy lifting but I just feel like
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
with all the notes that have been taken
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
all the work that we've put into the
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
things that need to be changed I feel
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
like within the week OS could put them
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
in there and um and I think by next week
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
I think this could be solved and I think
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
if we had a study committee I mean the
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time and effort that that
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
study committee would have to do to
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
catch up to what we've already done and
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
the leg work we've already done in this
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee I feel like I that would be
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
kind of sad so for me I personally would
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
prefer we just forge on and see if we
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
can get this done by next week and if we
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
can great if not if you really feel like
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the next week it really
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
does need still a lot of work then then
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
maybe but you know worst case scenario
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should rely on it
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
because I think we should feel confident
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
about the bill before we passed it but
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
if we passed it and it went to the
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and then we found out oh there's
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
a one little tweak here or there Senate
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
could fix it and you know it does happen
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
where Sometimes some something will pass
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
the house and then the sponsor goes to
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate and says vote this down
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
because I found things that are wrong
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
with it that does happen too so I I
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
personally I think it would be sad if we
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
sent this to a study committee and lost
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
so much of this this actually has a
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
study committee included in the language
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
um all this the all the work that we've
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
already put into it um I don't think we
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
should give up on that no represent
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
Bixby so I had a comment which the chair
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
already made for me oh sorry and no
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
problem and I have a question for the
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
chair uh in in her role as the uh Prime
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment which is um how
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
much of a how much of a lift is it for
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
you to do uh summer all the things we've
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
talked about uh I I I'm just I want I
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to put I don't want this to
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh sort of be an infinite regress of
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
just adding one more thing and one more
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
thing and one more thing uh I think some
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the things we've talked about Pro
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
probably are not a very heavy lift I
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
just want to get a sense of where you
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
are in terms of what makes sense to do
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
now and and what yeah well the the thing
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
the things that we T talked about uh
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
putting in fixes for you know with a
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
imminent danger and um talking about
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
well we have
 
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
to look at section nine a little bit for
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
the wording but
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I don't know how comfortable I
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
am in putting in definitions right now I
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
think that's something that uh with the
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
study committee that's included in this
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
um bill we can refine at some point
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
later on when we do the study committee
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds good to me and another thing
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
to remember is that when we do the study
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
committee if we look at it again and
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
decide that uh what we wrote this week
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
is not as concise or perfectly worded as
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
it needs to be that's something we can
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
take up with a study committee uh but we
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
want we need to have some changes now in
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we don't have a
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
um a a one-year lag in terms of getting
 
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
these protections into into into place I
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
agree representative wheeler thank you
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I don't want to overstep my
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
bounds here as a freshman on this
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee but I do see that we're only
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
five minutes under an hour on this
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
discussion with five minutes left uh
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
five bills left only 20 minutes left on
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
the I would like to move on thank you
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we have uh a good
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
amount of uh you know some some things
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
that needed some editing so I will take
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
care of those uh and of course uh you
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
know we have the issue of it not being
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the right proper Amendment to the
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
proper bill so um and anyway uh thank
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
you all for your work and comments on
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
this and uh we will move on to HB
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
152 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
adhesive rodent
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
traps um I don't know we've we've kind
 
01:49:44.109 --> 01:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
of talked about this already I don't
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
know that anybody is uh really changed
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
in their view of this so I think we
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to talk about it more now
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
we'll have a vote in hour or so and
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
we'll what happens will happen okay
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all right moving on to uh HB
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
251 the infamous squirrel
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
bill um I have an amendment that was uh
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
sent out by representative Spain and I'm
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to pass it along to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
everybody um there's two pages here
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
please take one of each one is the law
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh regarding fishing game and the other
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
is can I have a copy too um and the
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
other is the section 201 colon 14 and
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
the other is the amendment that he's
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
offering up and pretty much what I want
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
to say about this is that the amendment
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Spain is offering
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
up is is at least to
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
allow people who have raccoons and gray
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
squirrels who are moving into New
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they have them as pets
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
already in another state that if they
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
move into the state they that they may
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
bring their pets with them to the state
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um it it reads raccoons
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
and gray squirrels may be possessed as
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
companion animals without a permit from
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
the Department if a person relocates
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
from a state with a raccoon or gray
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
squirrel where it is legal to keep a
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
raccoon or gray squirrel so long as such
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
animal is up to date on any vaccines
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
required the raccoon or a gray squirrel
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
shall not be confiscated or euthanized
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the owner
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in this paragraph shall be
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
construed as enabling or trapping
 
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
breeding and sale of raccoons and gray
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
squirrels so this would go
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
into um The Fish and Game General
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh import possession or
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
release of Wildlife and so I'd like to
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
open up some discussion I'm I'm actually
 
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
fairly okay with this I think um
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
this takes out the piece having to do
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
with fish and game Rehabilitation and if
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
they can't rehabilitate the animal to
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
set it back into the wild uh where they
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
would be able to give it out for
 
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
adoption to someone else so that piece
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
is all been cut out um all this allows
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
for is for someone who has a raccoon or
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
gray squirrel as a pet in a state that
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
allows that that if they are moving to
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they can bring their pet
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
with them so representative King thank
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um two things uh one is
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
that the amendment says so long as such
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
animals up to date on any vaccines and
 
01:52:40.069 --> 01:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if that should also
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
include include some sort of provision
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
for staying up to- date on vaccines and
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
then the other question I have is really
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
just sort of a I don't know a question
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
to throw out there and that is
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
I I definitely support the idea that you
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
know you're moving from out of state you
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
come in you don't have to give up your
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
animal but it does put us in this weird
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
sort of potential legal limbo that you
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
know people moving from out of state
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
have more rights than natives um and I'm
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that's even
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional I don't know I honestly
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't know I just thought it would be an
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
interesting topic thank you
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative kto thank you madam chair
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question when it says up
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
to-date on any vaccines required
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
um are they required to have a rabies
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine because I think um different
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
states could have different vaccine
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
requirements but I think with New
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rabies is always required so
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
Michel I don't know represent Scully and
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
then Howard thank thank you madam chair
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
I I had said earlier personally that I
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
think uh trying to let people legally
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
own raccoons as a not non-starter for me
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they are bigger
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
more dangerous and they also have a much
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
higher chance of being infected with
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
rabies and I believe the testimony
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
before our committee was that there is
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
no vaccine schedule for these animals
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
because they're considered wild animals
 
01:54:06.669 --> 01:54:06.679 align:start position:0%
and it does seem weird that we would
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
give special rights to somebody moving
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
into the state when we're saying you
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
can't have these animals you know to the
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire who who actually
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
live here so I I I I think I
 
01:54:21.629 --> 01:54:21.639 align:start position:0%
love representative Spain's heart's in
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
the right place but uh I would not vote
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the base Bill and quite honestly I
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't vote for this amendment either
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby yeah so um oh
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Howard I'm sorry I'm so sorry
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I I uh he stole
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of my points and that is the the
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination there is no schedule there
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
is no requirement there is there isn't
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
even one that's made for them so that
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's a problem there I also think that
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
um the proof of whether where you know
 
01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
the origins of your pet ship of these
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
animals whether it happened on another
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
side of the Border or inside our borders
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
it would be a hard thing to prove thank
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
you represent Bixby and then represent
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to chair for to thank the
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
chair for handing out a copy of current
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
statute uh and uh where it says um at
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the section uh import
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
possession or release of Wildlife no
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
person shall import possess cell exhibit
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
or release any Marine wild spe uh live
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
marine species or Wildlife or the eggs
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
or progeny thereof without first
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining a permit from the executive
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
director accept its permitted under tile
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
um 18 the director the executive
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
director shall have the authority to
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
determine the time and any other
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
conditions governing the issuance of the
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
permit the chief wild of the wildlife
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
division shall respond to the request
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
for a permit within 60 days of
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
submission for final request and there's
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
a capacity for appeal so there is a
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism existing in law for a small
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
for you know
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
those small number of individuals who uh
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
do want to bring uh a uh Wildlife into
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
the state that they have in their
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
possession uh so there the the procedure
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
exists it has the oversight I don't
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
think we need to make a law that create
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
could create Lo loopholes to that oh my
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative minor thank you
 
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm not certain did you just
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
say recommend this for itl absolutely
 
01:56:42.639 --> 01:56:45.189 align:start position:0%
say recommend this for itl absolutely
okay

01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
represent okay thank you madam chair I
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
totally agree I this gives this gives an
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
effect more rights to a squirrel and
 
01:56:56.189 --> 01:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
raccoon and we have a dog all right
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you all right we'll move on from
 
01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm done
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay allowing for the sale of
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried foods produced in Homestead
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
food operations okay so here's a deal
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
with this the amendment is ready it's
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
upstairs I just got a a thing from
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
OS um yeah if you may it's uh 505 HB 505
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it should be a
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
there um so I met with uh people from
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
food safety um Friday and also Monday
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
and we came up with a plan um and the
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
plan is um I guess I'm going to also
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
talk about the dehydrated meat bill
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
which is the next bill on our
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
list um because of the nature of the
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
dehydrated meat because of me meat is
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
being so potentially
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous um think that that bill should
 
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:54.189 align:start position:0%
hazardous um think that that bill should
be

01:57:54.189 --> 01:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
ited uh we're not ready to do anything
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
with that right now but um we've come to
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
the conclusion for um at least
 
01:58:04.719 --> 01:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
the conclusion for um at least
freeze-dried

01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried
 
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.790 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried
foods

01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
foods
 
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:10.910 align:start position:0%
foods
that

01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
um if if and I have language for this uh
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
a person can sell freeze-dried
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
food and that incl includes vegetables
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
that includes fruit that includes
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
processed dairy products like yogurt or
 
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:28.550 align:start position:0%
processed dairy products like yogurt or
ice

01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
ice
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
cream that what they can do is is go
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
through the process of getting a
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
homestead food license which costs like
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
$150 a year um they would then also um
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
take a food safety class because these
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
foods are also potentially hazardous and
 
01:58:49.229 --> 01:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
we not we understand that we're taking a
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food and making it
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
into a self stable freeze-dried product
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and that also they should go through
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
a process review so that there's at
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
least some oversight to see that what
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing is they're doing it
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
properly and I don't think that that's
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
really um um a a heavy ask to do for
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to be doing this
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and producing these Foods uh and is also
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
gives a level of protection to the
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
public who's going to be consuming them
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where this is and um DHHS was
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind enough to provide some language
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
where we would establish this in uh RSA
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
143a colon uh ayen 12 section 4 to read
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
that Homestead food operations
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
processing and selling freeze-dried
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
foods from the homestead residents so
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
they don't need a commercial kitchen or
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
anything just from their Homestead
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
residence in their kitchen
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh at the owner's owned Farm Stand at
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and they can also sell
 
02:00:00.750 --> 02:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
stores um not the internet that's not
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
indicated here um stores shall be
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA 143a colon 4 and for
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this section
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried food means fruits
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
vegetables and commercially prepared
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
dairy products so it gives them a wide
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
variety of products that they can
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
produce it gives us um some oversight in
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
how that process is done um
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
and uh also allows them to sell this in
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
retail food stores so representative
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
barar you had your hand yes thank you
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm curious um defining
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
process review I know that there's a
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
stumbling block uh to uh the gentleman
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
who testified um regarding freeze drying
 
02:00:55.629 --> 02:00:55.639 align:start position:0%
where he had to send recipes and all
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of information
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
um uh and it cost a tremendous amount of
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
money it was very cumbersome so could
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%

please okay see if we can do this

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Michelle

robers I'm the bureau chief for public
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
health protection within the division of
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%

02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm Erica Davis the
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
administrator of the food protection
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
section um Department of Health and
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
Human Services Division of Public Safety
 
02:01:40.079 --> 02:01:41.589 align:start position:0%
Human Services Division of Public Safety
public

02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
health so hap happy to answer your
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
question so um a process review um helps
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
us understand uh the the the process
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
itself is is safe in terms of not um so
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
that the end product is shelf shelf
 
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
stable and typically those Pro those
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
processes aren't done at the state so
 
02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
those are handled I think there's the
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
two closest to us are at Cornell
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
University and the University of Maine I
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
believe and um the costs varied between
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
them but I think it's about actually you
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
probably know more than I do it does
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
depend on the product um and the place
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
that you're having the process valuation
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
completed um it it can be a stumbling
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
block um but it really gives us that
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the product and the
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
process um to ensure that the final
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
product is at the proper um it has been
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
produced properly um to be safe to
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
sell and the cost is about it it it does
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
depend it can be under main can be under
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
300 um there are Main and Cornell are
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
not the only two that you can send out
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
to there are are other a list of other
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
process reviewers that will um evaluate
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
products uh thank you can I any other
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
question for them uh not a question I
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to summarize
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
um again this was the stumbling block
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
for my constituent who came to testify
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
and they shut his his dreams down it was
 
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
the process review which was a huge
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
issue for
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
him um his testimony is part of the
 
02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
record I'll take a look and okay if um
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby I'm sorry King and then
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
Bixby I know that we are doing a study
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the process
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
review um so I I'm inclined to put that
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
in right now and then come back to it uh
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
at a later time to revise that but
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
anyway representative king um thank you
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair um two quick questions one
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
or one question one statement um was
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
this bill worked on by the food safety
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at all has this had you was
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
there I think we have a food safety
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah we did did this ever
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
get worked on yeah we did we had uh we
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
met and we talked about both
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
had I had the two Amendment ments and
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find them here oh here I
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
we had the two amendments and had some
 
02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
discussion on it
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and um you know came up with some
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
ideas about it but
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't something that um the Food
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
Safety Division would have supported M
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
and this is something that they would
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
support okay and um the reason I asked
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
mainly is because uh we're waiting on
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
the actual HB 505 Amendment right we
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay um the only thing I would say to
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is that it's we're supposed to have
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
an exec session on 505 today and I
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
personally would not feel comfortable
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
voting on that until I think I need to
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
like spend some time on this over the
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
week I'd like to get the because it's
 
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
not just going to be a a you know comma
 
02:05:14.109 --> 02:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
half sentence change that the amendment
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to be like a
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
substantive uh Amendment and I I
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
personally would like it if we'd recess
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
505 until next week if that's okay yeah
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem represent I think
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
that recessing it till next week makes a
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
lot of sense uh because well for all the
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh representative King
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
explained yep yep okay well that's the
 
02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.270 align:start position:0%
explained yep yep okay well that's the
plan

02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
then okay um so I do have thank you
 
02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
ladies thank you so much so I do have a
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment I'm going to send

it around uh and we can
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%

though it's my bill um and 505 we have
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%

02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
it over the week if people have any
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%

02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
quickly the amendment and um there was a
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
couple things that were not put
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
incorrectly from OS in regards with um
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
aquifer language which will basically
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
change to like drinking water wells um
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
in a couple of those places
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
um we
 
02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:10.530 align:start position:0%
discussed there were questions about
 
02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
discussed there were questions about
[Music]

02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
um um page three um in regards lines 18
 
02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:22.250 align:start position:0%
through 24
 
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:24.229 align:start position:0%
through 24
[Music]

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
um for uh you know signifant you know
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
basically denying a permit for
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
significant history of repeated serious
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
violations um director whims was kind
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
enough to speak to this um we could
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
modify this a bit uh you know look
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
through what is in current rules right
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
now see where um I still think there's a
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
couple gaps I still would would like to
 
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
have something like this in here um it
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
also gives the discretion to the agency
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as well um so there's that piece that
 
02:09:05.110 --> 02:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
might change a little bit
 
02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:06.950 align:start position:0%
might change a little bit

02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
um if everybody wants me to remove the
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
Ford act lines 15 161 17 from page three
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
I will be happy to do so it um it really
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
it it's it's federal law it shouldn't
 
02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
it it's it's federal law it shouldn't
matter

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
um it being there or not there so um but
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
if you guys want it removed if that's a
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
consensus here I will remove it
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and I did want to say just because I
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
think a point is is really important and
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted on the record um you know
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
the point of mentioning of when the bill
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
was first designed the point of
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
mentioning the aquifer is really Crystal
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
Clear we want to protect it so you you
 
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
know you basically you protect New
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's drinking water by not
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
polluting the same formation where the
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
water originates that's it so but I will
 
02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that OS has got it
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
specifically in there with drinking
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
water wells and all of that throughout
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
the bill but I just wanted that to be on
 
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
record um that's really important so
 
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:15.070 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
everything else
[Music]

02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
um in here has been changed from the
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
setback where we talked here's there's
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
the map on the table so um the 3000t
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
setback map that we have that we had
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
previously here is the new one which is
 
02:10:33.639 --> 02:10:34.470 align:start position:0%
previously here is the new one which is
the

02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
1500 which um opens up the universe more
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh it was it basically left about um
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
3,000 left about
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
43% I believe of the state available
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
like if we needed to have another
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
landfill um this I this probably brings
 
02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
it up to um maybe closer to 60% or
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
something like that um the director
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
whims could speak to that possibly but
 
02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:07.559 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot more white space here
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
so that's good to know um and other than
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
that um all of the issues where um it
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
was more restrictive with
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
it being 10 miles from superf fund all
 
02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:25.559 align:start position:0%
of those things have been
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
removed um descriptions have been
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
changed just so that they match exactly
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
and um I will bring these minor changes
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
to um to
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
OLS uh today and have them fix that and
 
02:11:53.549 --> 02:11:53.559 align:start position:0%
get this back out um to all of you and
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
of course if there's anything else here
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
that you're thinking that we should
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
discuss in changing um yeah speak now or
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
forever representative King thank you
 
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just want to let the
 
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee know that the solid waste
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's views on this bill are
 
02:12:17.470 --> 02:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
not unanimous um hope I'm not throwing
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative Scully under the bus but
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
um I think he generally opposes the bill
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
from what I could understand and I
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
mention that partly because there's talk
 
02:12:29.950 --> 02:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we may try and get this bill into
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:12:35.069 --> 02:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
hb2 and you know that we might have like
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
a committee letter um to do that but I
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
think it's important to respect uh the
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
uh the thoughts and opinions of all the
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee members and that we might not
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
have unanimous consent as far as that is
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
concerned so if maybe he would like to
 
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
speak on that but I just wanted to uh
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
mention that I presum
 
02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
Scully well since my name was
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I will tell you I'm
 
02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
actually much more comfortable with this
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
version of the bill than I was with the
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
original one that had so many
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
restrictions my my great concern is that
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh without fully thinking
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the implications create con uh
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions that will ultimately shoot
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
us in the foot down the road when it
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
comes time to actually put a landfill in
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
especially if you found one that um met
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh what I hope to be past our new Ben
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
you know beneficial use uh evaluation
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
and so the fewer restrictions we put in
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
here categorically the more comfortable
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
I am with this for instance that the uh
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
fiveyear um travel time very comfortable
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
with that um the arbitrary setback I I
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
still have to get my my head around um
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
to say whether we ought to be doing both
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
if we have a good functional um you know
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
requirement saying in terms of 5-year
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
travel time for anything that might
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
escape a landfill um I did think
 
02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:02.599 align:start position:0%
the that section 24 which is on uh page
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
three I felt the language was very vague
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like we have the
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
functional equivalence of that already
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
in rules I think we ought to consider
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
just dropping that because it sounds
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
like it's already covered um I did I
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually had one other question for the
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the director I don't know if if
 
02:14:22.109 --> 02:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for us to asked this
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
sure if you have a question for the
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
director and he's here okay please uh
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
please ask him your question well thank
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you director yeah thank thank
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
you um so representative Penza has a
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
provision in here to have 247 coverage
 
02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
at the landfill and she has cited that
 
02:14:44.990 --> 02:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's been actual releases that
 
02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
occurred because the monitoring system
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
has failed um is this a reasonable
 
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
requirement to put in for any future
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
landfill um you know installations here
 
02:14:59.229 --> 02:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire yeah I I think that
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mike wisat
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the record director of the waste
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
Dees um I I think I did speak to this
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
earlier and and I believe what I said
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
was that we believe that um at the
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
agency that actually the resources that
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
be be required to do that would be
 
02:15:21.310 --> 02:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
better spent on um electronic and autom
 
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
alarms that would ensure that a
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
responsible party a person on call what
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
have you would be um would be notified
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
um and could come to the facility and
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is that uh and again
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
I I think in many respects it' be more
 
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the for the um regulated
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
Community to respond to this as well but
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh it strikes as there's a lot of costs
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
associated with keeping someone at a
 
02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
associated with keeping someone at a
facility

02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
247 it is not clear to us that that
 
02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
would necessarily result unless that
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
person were particularly um
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about the operation of the
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
landfill um and more likely it would be
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
like a security guard that they wouldn't
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that something was
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
wrong and so we're not we're just not
 
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
convinced that that's maybe the best way
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
to use the resources to ensure that a
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
release or or some kind of a a problem
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
or incident that a landfill was detected
 
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
may I ask a followup to you may ask a
 
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
followup but I also want to interject
 
02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
something I've been to U this past week
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh folks for the New Hampshire
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
clean water had a uh an event a
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
breakfast and they were talking about um
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
credible and and real threats to these
 
02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
credible and and real threats to these
different

02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
installations not only water places but
 
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
certainly other facilities that use
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
software or um electronic means to to
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
monitor these kinds of things and how
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
those uh those facilities can be hacked
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
into um by anybody who is you know
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
looking to seek uh to make damage to
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
these areas so um I can appreciate
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
having a person on site to actually
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
monitor things as opposed to letting it
 
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
monitor things as opposed to letting it
be

02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
monitored remotely or whatever which
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
could be hacked into um so go ahead
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
repres of Scully that's kind of my my
 
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
thought behind this too okay well um a
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
good point because I was going to ask uh
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
were suggesting or recommending that we
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
rely on the technology for vote
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
monitoring uh is there some way to
 
02:17:38.429 --> 02:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
significantly strengthen and tighten
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
this up so the possibilities of a
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
problem could be minimized we actually
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
did address that in our most recent rul
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
making in which we made specific
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with automated
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
diet ERS that would dial continue to
 
02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
dial responsible facility Personnel
 
02:17:58.589 --> 02:17:58.599 align:start position:0%
every 10 minutes until until they were
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
responsive okay representative Bixby and
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
then I'm gonna back here yes so um I'd
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
be comfortable not having someone
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
actually on site 247 as long as there is
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
someone who is essentially on call 247
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
that could be could quickly respond to
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh a an
 
02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:19.389 align:start position:0%
uh a an
automated

02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
automated
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh alert system like that is that is
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately hardened to not be S
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
generally available on the internet
 
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
Etc sure
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
um you and then
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
guber and then down that way thank you
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just have a question and
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is for you director
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
or for someone on the committee here but
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
on page two line 20 um all throughout
 
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
the bill we talk about the 5year
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
distance of travel except on line 20
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's or500 ft now why are we doing that
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
and what is the importance of that um
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know because if the 5year distance
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
of travel is really what we're relying
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
on for everything why do we have that
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
you want to answer that representative
 
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I'd like to answer that so um
 
02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
the need for a combination of basically
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
travel time and some kind of um
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
distance Bas like minimal setback in a
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
sense is because if there is a
 
02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
catastrophic um surface spill then you
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
really don't want to be so close to like
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
a lake or a river or something like that
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
um so that's the reason why you have
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
both both are in rules right now and it
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be and it needs to be longer so
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
um you just have to make sure that when
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
it if it flows right into the ground and
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
above ground that it's not going right
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
down to where it should be so that's why
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
you have both thank you for that and
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
what is the current uh distance right
 
02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:08.670 align:start position:0%
what is the current uh distance right
now

02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
500 thank you uh we had do we have did I
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
say someone else here guber yeah
 
02:20:15.870 --> 02:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gruber and then over to
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want toat death anymore I just
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
have two two two items one for uh thank
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
you for being here commissioner the um
 
02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe on the refer to
 
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
this uh Staffing on on site 24 hours 24
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
hours a day
 
02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm leaning towards the same
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
point that there should be technology
 
02:20:50.429 --> 02:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
and 24-hour coverage with backup power
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
what whatever it is uh with today's
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
technology that can't be easily um uh
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
violated uh do you think that a uh
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
off-site person with the technology
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
could provide equal or better uh
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
security for a uh an event to be uh
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
identify in a timely manner well I I
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
think as I as I've testified um we think
 
02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
that the the resources going towards a
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
robust system of electronic um and
 
02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.070 align:start position:0%
robust system of electronic um and
notification

02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
notification
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know systems is probably the most
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
helpful going to the the note that was
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
made before by I think representative
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
bxby about having a person designated as
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
on call my I suspect that facilities are
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
are essentially doing that that they
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
that most of our major facilities would
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a person who is uh expected to be
 
02:21:43.630 --> 02:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
ready to respond if there's an after
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
hours incident and and certainly you
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that they don't have
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
that they should so if that were
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
something something that want you know
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
that the committee wanted to put into
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the bill I think that would might make
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
some sense I don't think our rules
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
specifically address that topic question
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure was um uh for this uh page three uh
 
02:22:09.389 --> 02:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
lines 18 through 24 we're talking about
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
um the information provided for what we
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
have in rules right now um would uh
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative P would she would that be
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
basically meet your needs uh uh I think
 
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
it would meet my needs if if we looked
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
at it because there seem to be fairly
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
robust uh rules on um through uh they're
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
in place for lines 18 to 24 on page
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
three regarding um who the individual
 
02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.630 align:start position:0%
three regarding um who the individual
organization

02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:42.830 align:start position:0%
organization
characters

02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
characters
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
um let me can you tell me the lines
 
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
again page three it's regarding the
 
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
issue of uh the history of V you know
 
02:22:53.950 --> 02:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that who who runs these
 
02:22:58.270 --> 02:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
facilities has the proper uh well they
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a record that's inappropriate
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
for who should be running these
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
important facilities line 18 line 18
 
02:23:07.389 --> 02:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
yeah 18 through 24 on page three that so
 
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying that section you're saying
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I the whole thing well no I'm not
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying Nick it but look at the what we
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
have for language all right and
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
necessary but not we talked about that
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the Sub sub committee um
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to have that
 
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with me of course okay um I
 
02:23:29.269 --> 02:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
want to go back
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the page three about having a a
 
02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:34.590 align:start position:0%
to the page three about having a a
person

02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
contracted we have um all of the
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
technology in the world that having in
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
rules right now all of the monitoring
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
systems which you know um all of that
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's already in place I get that um
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing that's a fails sayfe
 
02:23:57.269 --> 02:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
for someone being there eyes and ears
 
02:24:00.429 --> 02:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
and and hearing it and so I understand
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
there could be an on call person that
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
obviously would have to be close by or
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
something like that but we're talking
 
02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
about a a private facility that
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
makes this is a billion dooll you know
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of them that's in Rochester that's a
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
billion doll or more company to have to
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
require to have one person there on
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
staff to um be monitoring and all of the
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
electronic that's already in place I
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
just I still don't I don't get that
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
especially with the level of um just in
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the last week the level of infiltration
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
that has happened to some of the highest
 
02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
tech companies right now that's going on
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
from hacking to all of that do
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
you where do you where do you want to
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
create Havoc Water waste what you could
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
do to something is is unbelievable and
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I just technology is all fine and
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
dandy and we're going to have all of
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
that I I you know I argue that this is
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know in here if the entire committee
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
is against it I will pull it that's fine
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go with consensus but um I
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we're we're looking to
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
um save money for for a very profitable
 
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
industry um representative wheeler I'm
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to work my way up this way thank
 
02:25:29.309 --> 02:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just to concur with what
 
02:25:31.269 --> 02:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative Penza
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
said if organizations businesses like
 
02:25:34.399 --> 02:25:36.389 align:start position:0%
said if organizations businesses like
Sony

02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
Sony
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
or Enron or Exxon excuse me or these big
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
oil Industries these big very
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
well-funded almost trillion dollar
 
02:25:47.710 --> 02:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
Industries billion dollar companies can
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
get hacked and have their system is
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
hacked in a way that releases all the
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
data of everyone in the country or
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
significant information about critical
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
resources in our country all this is
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
happening right now if those things can
 
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
happen and if the United States
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
government the federal government of the
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
United States of America can get hacked
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
then I think that these companies can
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
get hacked too and I don't know if there
 
02:26:14.429 --> 02:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
is to answer representative scully's
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
question from a few minutes ago a fail
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
safe for technology and as
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Penza said you can't you
 
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
can't beat the eyes and the ears being
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
there on the ground listening seeing and
 
02:26:29.269 --> 02:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
actually getting to interact with the
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
facility and given the fact that this is
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
a company that I think could afford
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
these fail safes it should be something
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the legislature moves on forward to
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
say that this is something somebody
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
should be at the facility watching it so
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we can actually know and see and
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
hear what's going on at that facility
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
that makes complete sense to me okay
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I'll just say it real quickly
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
kind of one of the favorite sayings of
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
our former colleague on this committee
 
02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
represented of Murray was belts and
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
suspenders right that you have two
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
systems of protection and this goes both
 
02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
for the setback distance there's travel
 
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
time and there's also the 1500 ft and
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative patens spoke to that well
 
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
if you have a massive surface spill you
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you're not so
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
close to a body of water surface uh
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
speed being different and faster than
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
subsurface speed so that's a sec two
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
layers of protection I think that's a
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
good thing and likewise with this
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
question about monitoring in person and
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring with technology I think we
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
need it both our the most important
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
Safety Systems we have when we're
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
talking about transportation for example
 
02:27:44.349 --> 02:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh incorporate both human oversight and
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring and I think that
 
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
is exactly the measure of safety we
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
should be insisting on here
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby okay I have two points
 
02:27:57.269 --> 02:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh one is a um practical point one one
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
one is just I'd like to concur with what
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative gerana just said I am
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
happy to go with uh with with some with
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
having that um someone onsite all the
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
time uh I I think that it's not a
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
particularly big ask for a company of
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
the size that would be running up the
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
landfill uh the other thing is um I
 
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
would like to ask representative poent
 
02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
tza to uh
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
have have OSS provide a due date for ol
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
that is soon enough so that you can then
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
distribute the whole the uh the revised
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the committee so we have a
 
02:28:37.469 --> 02:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
couple of days to look it
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
over thank you representative Scully I'm
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
sorry I just I'm sorry representative
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
King first then represent Scully thank
 
02:28:46.429 --> 02:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and I just want to
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what Representatives
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
wheeler Jer and Bixby said I to agree
 
02:28:52.469 --> 02:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
that it's good to have somebody on site
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know um corporations will often
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
employ security guards to guard like
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
light bulbs that are just sitting there
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
and do nothing so if if these
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
Corporation if these companies can can
 
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
hire security guards to to protect
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
something that's uh inert uh then we
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
should also be uh demanding protection
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
for something that could potentially
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
ruin the environment and the thing is is
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the cost of this employee is going
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
to be passed on to the consumers and I
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that actually
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
happens that's a good thing because when
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities are determining how to
 
02:29:27.309 --> 02:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
dispose of their waste they need to take
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
into account all of the costs of their
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
waste and the thing is is that for too
 
02:29:36.429 --> 02:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
long um we've been able to uh basically
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
just um cut the cost of the waste at the
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
expense of the environment and I don't
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
like that I think that you know when you
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's like when you buy a product you're
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
buying a a something that's wrapped in
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
plastic and it's like okay you've paid
 
02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
for the cost of of the product but you
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
haven't yet paid for the cost of the
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
disposal of the product and I think it's
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
important that all the true cost the
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
true the the true charges that would add
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
up to disposal are in there and if this
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
is another charge that's going to be
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
added on to
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities my goal My Hope Is that
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
eventually municipalities are going to
 
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
say you know what the charges the cost
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
of disposing things in the ground is
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
more than some other method like for
 
02:30:18.750 --> 02:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
example waste energy incineration plants
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe even shipping it to a location
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's not as environmentally hazardous
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
as it is here so so for me I'm in no way
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
shape or form uh liking the idea of
 
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
trying to cut costs for um for landfills
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think we need to jack those costs up
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
to Infinity thank
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
you represent representa
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
Scully um I I guess I would just point
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
out that um I understand people's
 
02:30:47.790 --> 02:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about remote hacking but if
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
you've got like a simple Sump System
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
that has a monitor that tells you when a
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
level's been reached in a tank you can
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
set that system up such that your safety
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
equipment is not uh you C you cannot
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
change what it does remotely what we're
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about is whether an an
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
alarm is struck a level is reached and
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
that message is then sent remotely to
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else so I mean I guess you
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
could think of North Korean hackers
 
02:31:20.349 --> 02:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
coming in and saying we're we're going
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
to keep somebody from getting that you
 
02:31:24.429 --> 02:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
know alarm that the level has been
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
reached but the systems themselves can
 
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
be set up such that they're they're a
 
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
Clos system there's a firewall there and
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
you can't go in and hack those things to
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
stop their safety functions from
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
occurring represent Penza did you guys
 
02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:42.389 align:start position:0%
occurring represent Penza did you guys
have

02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
anything all right represent Penza uh
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my last point on
 
02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
this because I think we've really um
 
02:31:56.110 --> 02:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh gone around and around is is this so
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
the security piece that was just
 
02:32:01.389 --> 02:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned um that right there alone is
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why someone should be there
 
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
all of the time a person should be there
 
02:32:09.070 --> 02:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
all of the time on site it is very easy
 
02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
especially with a landfill um like we
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
have in Rochester which is the largest
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
in the state for someone to come in and
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
set it on fire so just so you know
 
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
that's very easy to do so we've got
 
02:32:25.269 --> 02:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
gases that are coming out and all of
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so if you just look
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
at that piece and that piece alone for
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
security um that's huge I mean
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
everything's posted all over that
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
property the you can very easily um
 
02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's lots of hazardous you know um
 
02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
materials and stuff like that that are
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
there I'm not talking about hazardous
 
02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
waste I'm talking about materials and
 
02:32:49.469 --> 02:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
places like that that just for security
 
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
reasons Alone um we should have there
 
02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
should be somebody there not even
 
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
talking about when you know about
 
02:33:00.429 --> 02:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
releases or something catastrophic that
 
02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
could happen to the
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
environment okay thank you I think uh
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
We've pretty much ended discussion on uh
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
hb77 I've just passed out
 
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:15.640 align:start position:0%
um a proposed house resolution um this
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
is uh with in response to the um meet
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
Slaughter Bill and and thank you uh
 
02:33:25.389 --> 02:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
director wiim whims for um taking our
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
questions um so the meat Slaughter bill
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
which we
 
02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:32.030 align:start position:0%
which we
retained

02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
um represent Bixby and I I just have a
 
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
question could we perhaps um uh recess
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
the work session and go to caucus for
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
five minutes to figure out what we're
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
doing and then take up the res
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
resolution uh after the um exec session
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
because we're running like about well I
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
wanted I wanted to just explain this
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
before we go to caucus okay fair enough
 
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think we're pretty much done
 
02:33:59.469 --> 02:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
with our work session so I don't know
 
02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
that we need to recess that okay um the
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh this proposed house resolution I
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain it to you before we go
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
into a caucus before we exec some bills
 
02:34:10.359 --> 02:34:12.150 align:start position:0%
into a caucus before we exec some bills
out

02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
um because of we retained that meat
 
02:34:19.389 --> 02:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
Slaughter Bill and um we wanted to have
 
02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
a house resolution much like the house
 
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
resolution that was presented by Ways
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
and Means last Thursday on the house
 
02:34:31.150 --> 02:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
floor um what I was told by clerk Paul
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
Smith was that if we as a committee vote
 
02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
on this proposed house
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
resolution and we agree on it that then
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
we can take this language to OS have it
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
drafted and bring it to the house floor
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
just like Ways and Means did with their
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue estimates
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm worked on uh representative Bixby
 
02:34:58.750 --> 02:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
took language that we had from um uh
 
02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:00.030 align:start position:0%
took language that we had from um uh
Farm

02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
Farm
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
Bureau and um because Farm Bureau gave
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
us the house resolution representative
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
Bix be paired it down um and then um I
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
met with um Farm Bureau yesterday uh and
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
they had a couple other changes so this
 
02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
is the end document um basically urging
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation to sponsor
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and also urging the United
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
States Department of Agriculture to
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
adopt regulations allowing for
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
smallscale Slaughter plants to use the
 
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
federal Meat Inspection acts custom
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
exempt meat processing inspection
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
criteria with a third-party inspector
 
02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
present at Slaughter so that processed
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
beef pork lamb and Chevron goat meat can
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
be sold as individual Cuts directly from
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
the farm producer to the end consumer
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
HB thank you yes
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
uhu so that's what this house resolution
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
is and I hope that um when we finish
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
executing our bills we will uh I would
 
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
like to vote on this house resolution as
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
a committee and I hope that you will
 
02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
support it so with that I'm going to um
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
adjourn in our work session like and
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%

sale of freeze-dried foods produced in
 
02:58:18.670 --> 02:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
Homestead food operations
 
02:58:22.229 --> 02:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
um we have a um an amendment pending
 
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:25.080 align:start position:0%

02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recess this um exec session
 
02:58:34.950 --> 02:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
for um March 18th at 11:15
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
a.m. and I'm going to close the
 
02:58:42.750 --> 02:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh that HB
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
505 and move on to HB
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
642 allowing the sale of DEH hydrated
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
meat without a homestead food license
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
and I would like to move itl on that do
 
02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
I hear a second representative Howard
 
02:58:59.710 --> 02:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
seconds and I'll speak to my
 
02:59:04.429 --> 02:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
motion um in speaking with both the food
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
safety subcommittee and what we wanted
 
02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
to do and in conjunction with uh my
 
02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with Food Safety Division
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
HHS I believe that more thought needs to
 
02:59:21.429 --> 02:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
be put into introducing this type of
 
02:59:24.830 --> 02:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
meat product into Homestead food sales
 
02:59:29.309 --> 02:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
um meat is a very different
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
product than some of the other things
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed uh is a potentially
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous food handling of meat is uh
 
02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to be taken lightly and I think
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
um since this is even my bill I'd like
 
02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
to think more thoroughly on how this
 
02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
type of potentially hazardous food can
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
be prod produced and sold with just a
 
02:59:55.469 --> 02:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
little bit more oversight and um in this
 
02:59:58.030 --> 02:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
manner anyway so that is my reasoning
 
03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
for wanting to itl this bill is there
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
any other further comment
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
or discussion on
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
this seeing none um I would like to the

03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
ownership of certain squirrels and
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
raccoons do I hear a motion
 
03:01:22.269 --> 03:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I move that this bill be uh
 
03:01:24.910 --> 03:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
voted on as in expedient to legislate
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay do I hear a
 
03:01:29.590 --> 03:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
second second representative Bixby
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
second representative Scully would you
 
03:01:33.950 --> 03:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion well I
 
03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
think this bill is very well-meaning but
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
based on the expert testimony of our
 
03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife individuals these are
 
03:01:42.910 --> 03:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
wild animals there is no established
 
03:01:45.229 --> 03:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule which heightens the
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
danger of trying to keep them as pets
 
03:01:48.910 --> 03:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore we believe that this would
 
03:01:51.870 --> 03:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
be an unsafe U thing to allow people to
 
03:01:53.550 --> 03:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
do so I say that this should be
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate any further
 
03:01:59.229 --> 03:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
question um representative King thank
 
03:02:00.990 --> 03:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I'm going to be
 
03:02:03.870 --> 03:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
voting no against the motion um there's
 
03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
two main reasons why people have a
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill and that is that
 
03:02:10.429 --> 03:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh it would be dangerous to humans or it
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be unethical for Animals I think
 
03:02:16.110 --> 03:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
both of those arguments fall flat
 
03:02:18.750 --> 03:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
because um while squirrels and raccoons
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
may bite so do dogs and people get
 
03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
killed from dogs all the time uh we
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't ban them furthermore um uh while
 
03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
those may be Wildlife um actually all
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
animals are wildlife and we also have a
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
lot of animals that um um probably would
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
prefer to stay wild such as birds that
 
03:02:44.670 --> 03:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
we cage so all of the animals that um I
 
03:02:46.110 --> 03:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of animals that we
 
03:02:49.309 --> 03:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
do allow that um so if we do allow those
 
03:02:51.070 --> 03:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
animals I think we should also allow
 
03:02:53.469 --> 03:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
raccoons and squirrels and then the last
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
argument is well there's no vaccine
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
schedule well there's no vaccine
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
schedule because they're banned they're
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
just not allowed if we allowed them then
 
03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a vaccine schedule so I
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
think if you go through each one of the
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
arguments against you could
 
03:03:06.349 --> 03:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
systematically defeat them with basic
 
03:03:07.670 --> 03:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
logic so that's why I'm going to be
 
03:03:11.790 --> 03:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
voting uh against the motion but um I'm
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
fine with the going on consent calendar
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
once it gets defeated thank you
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah in addition to
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
all the
 
03:03:21.309 --> 03:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh reasons that representative Freeman
 
03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
cited sorry representative Scully cited
 
03:03:29.229 --> 03:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh also there is existing in uh ficient
 
03:03:31.590 --> 03:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
game laws a method a mechanism for
 
03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
permitting in the small number of cases
 
03:03:35.429 --> 03:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
where it might be
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
relevant representative wheeler thank
 
03:03:42.269 --> 03:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think representative
 
03:03:45.790 --> 03:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
King outlaid the I think representative
 
03:03:48.830 --> 03:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
King handled it well I just believe that
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is sort of uh it's a silly Bill
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
both ways whoever you look at it and I
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
think I'll be voting in favor of
 
03:03:58.750 --> 03:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
allowing people to own squirrels because
 
03:03:58.760 --> 03:03:59.950 align:start position:0%
allowing people to own squirrels because
it's

03:03:59.950 --> 03:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh not
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
as not significantly enough dangerous
 
03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
for me to say that the state should ban
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
the use of them would I say go out there
 
03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
and own a squirrel No but it's also not
 
03:04:15.150 --> 03:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
for me to say and I think somebody has
 
03:04:17.229 --> 03:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
the right if they come into the state
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
having own own a squirrel to own that
 
03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
squirrel and from a more funnier
 
03:04:23.710 --> 03:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
perspective I think of that squirrel
 
03:04:27.190 --> 03:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
that died last year peanut and you know
 
03:04:28.349 --> 03:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire doesn't want
 
03:04:32.110 --> 03:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
to get itself in any peanut scandals
 
03:04:35.429 --> 03:04:35.439 align:start position:0%

adhesive based rodent
 
03:06:10.030 --> 03:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
traps I am going to move itl on this
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill and do I hear a
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:22.830 --> 03:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted to second that okay
 
03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
sorry okay and I will speak to my
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
motion um rodent and rodent infestation
 
03:06:33.550 --> 03:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
is a problem rodents carry diseases like
 
03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
black plague and in the interest of
 
03:06:38.110 --> 03:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
Public Health I will side with the
 
03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
health of human beings and support the
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
use of all uh non-chemical means to
 
03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate problem problematic rodents uh
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
any way that you kill a rodent is going
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be considered cruel and um I I saw
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
that testimony uh for the use of glue
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
traps that that that is an effective way
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
to Monitor and capture
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
rodents um you also cannot control where
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
people purchase glue traps it would be
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
simple for people to buy them over the
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
Internet or go to a neighboring state um
 
03:07:13.150 --> 03:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
there are instructions on the packages
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
on how to properly use these products
 
03:07:18.510 --> 03:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
and I think we need need certainly a lot
 
03:07:22.510 --> 03:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
more public education on that um so that
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
non-target species are not being
 
03:07:28.750 --> 03:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
captured but in the end I I I am very
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
strongly against Banning any kind of
 
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
non-chemical means to control the rodent
 
03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
population um do I hear other
 
03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:39.630 align:start position:0%
population um do I hear other
representative

03:07:39.630 --> 03:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair uh I'm
 
03:07:44.349 --> 03:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the it motion on
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation but I do just want to
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
say and in case this gets brought back
 
03:07:54.670 --> 03:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
that it should not be under the and the
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture the
 
03:07:58.590 --> 03:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner asked us to not have this
 
03:08:01.229 --> 03:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
the enforcement be under his Department
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
as it doesn't land there and I think
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
there are just some serious structural
 
03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
problems with the legislation that could
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
be fixed uh if a little bit more work
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
was put into it so that's for the camera
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins if she's at
 
03:08:18.990 --> 03:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
home if you want to put that work into
 
03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation then I think that would
 
03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit more amenable to
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
people but uh I am going to vote with
 
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
the caucus on this
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
one represent
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair as someone
 
03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
um as I seconded this bill I just wanted
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
to point something out that's come to
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
light recently Jean Hackman's wife um
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
was found in her house and her cause of
 
03:08:48.309 --> 03:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
death was hirus and hirus is a real but
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
but lethal disease that rats carry only
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
rats so I'd like to point out that um
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
while those instances a antivirus may be
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
rare it's still lethal and if someone is
 
03:09:02.910 --> 03:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the rodent problem and we
 
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
limit what they can do in order to
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
exterminate those rodents then we are
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
exposing the public to some health risks
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe they did have a rodent
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
problem on their property so yeah
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative jera uh thank you madam
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
chair I I would have liked to you know
 
03:09:22.750 --> 03:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
if we had actually worked on amendment I
 
03:09:24.110 --> 03:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
realized that we understood where the
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
lines were drawn so it wouldn't have
 
03:09:27.550 --> 03:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
gotten us gotten us any closer I still
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
would have would have liked that
 
03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment we do in fact have ways of
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
regulating sales in state and and there
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
are ways to to Mark certain products is
 
03:09:37.190 --> 03:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
not for sale in certain States even uh
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
when it comes to purchasing them online
 
03:09:42.990 --> 03:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from from some folks that
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
some desire for us to find some kind of
 
03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
compromise uh because clearly there is
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
enough interest in this uh among our
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
constituents that the bill is going to
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
come back and we had a representative of
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
industry well but he he urged us to work
 
03:10:06.190 --> 03:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
towards some type of compromise in any
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
event uh I think there are many
 
03:10:10.630 --> 03:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
non-chemical options that are both less
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
cruel and have much less potential uh to
 
03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
have harmful impacts on other animals so
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the itl
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I would also remind people too that
 
03:10:22.750 --> 03:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
um you know these glue traps are used to
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
control pests like cockroaches and other
 
03:10:28.510 --> 03:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
insects and um while this bans them for
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
the use of rodents glue glue boards um I
 
03:10:34.830 --> 03:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how you can enforce using it
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
for one pest population versus
 
03:10:41.389 --> 03:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
another um so with that if there's any
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
no other further conversation I would
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role on the
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%

that have been recessed for next week uh
 
03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
we will have then four bills to vote on
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
next week and that will be the end of
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
what is on our plate um and uh please

as
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
possible and I want to thank
 
03:12:25.389 --> 03:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
everybody oh yeah we've got uh this I'm
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
sorry before we take off we've got this
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
house resolution to vote on I hope
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
everybody had a moment to read
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
it and um I
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
would entertain any discussion about it
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I just like to
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
point out that um I think this makes a
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
lot of sense uh
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I the it's a little bit longer
 
03:12:53.950 --> 03:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
than than what I than than the my
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
revision of it but I think that uh the
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
changes are fine in terms of I I wasn't
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
aware that there might be political
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
problems by mentioning the prime act the
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh Farm Bureau was aware of that so they
 
03:13:07.950 --> 03:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
asked to not have that language in here
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh their their language is a little bit
 
03:13:11.950 --> 03:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
more specific in in terms of how it
 
03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
might work I'm fine with that uh and
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron added in in that uh
 
03:13:21.070 --> 03:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
we would be making the ask of both the
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and also the USDA uh
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
the USDA can't do anything uh in terms
 
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
of regulations unless there's a change
 
03:13:34.590 --> 03:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
in statute so we need to have um both of
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
those parties be involved in it um and
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I I think that the list of
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
whereas is is uh sufficiently short but
 
03:13:48.309 --> 03:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
also sufficiently comprehensive to cover
 
03:13:50.429 --> 03:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
the reasons that this bill that this
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
resolution makes sense okay um so I
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
guess we have to have a motion for a to
 
03:13:58.389 --> 03:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
pass on this is that how I don't know
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I um I can move out to pass okay I
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
second wouldn't it be a motion for
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
adoption or adoption maybe it is
 
03:14:07.990 --> 03:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
adoption yeah sure oh okay motion for
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
adoption motion to adopt motion to adopt
 
03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
house resolution I second
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
it um if there's any other discussion on
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
this at all
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
no seeing none um could we do we have
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk call the rooll or just yeah
 
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we could do a Voice vote if that's
 
03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
yeah vote because if Paul says that we
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
should have done a voice I would rather
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
do a roll call because we should have
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
done a roll call then I don't want to
 
03:14:44.110 --> 03:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
have to come back okay correct all right
 
03:14:47.710 --> 03:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I guess you can
 
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
use one of your forms to do that yeah
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
just do a roll call vote and we'll
 
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
figure it out I suppose I can fill in
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
whatever I want so um this this house
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
resolution doesn't have any number does
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
it right okay so I'll just put that
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
blank and then I can always fill it in
 
03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
