with HB 253 establishing a committee to
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%

amendment which was put forth by
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby who unfortunately
 
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.180 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
due to illness although I understand he
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
may be listening from home so good
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
morning representative Bixby
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair yes so um what
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
you have before you is the original
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment um HB
 
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
basically as we had discussed initially
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
um we had three members named to the
 
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives appointed by
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
the speaker and instead of two members
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
there is one member as we discussed in
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
our last work session
 
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:37.700 align:start position:0%
um we also then in lines 11 through 13
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
included the
 
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.630 align:start position:0%
included the
um

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
statement that we should be reducing the
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
tax burden that Solid Waste Disposal
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
places on municipalities that was added
 
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
in there as well there is a scrivener's
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
error on line 14 that says exam it is
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
meant to say examining or examine
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
existing eprs epr laws and so that
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
includes States territories and
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
international jurisdictions and
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
establish priorities for more in-depth
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.690 align:start position:0%
establish priorities for more in-depth
study

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
and then further on line 17's asks that
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
we look at how ways in which laws could
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
be adapted to existing Solid Waste
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
Recovery infrastructure
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
and then in lines 20
 
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
and then in lines 20
um

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
it gives the study committee the
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
authority to solicit industry
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input on approaches
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
suggest possible legislation and then
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
also propose targeted study legislation
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
for approaches to adopt in the future
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
um and that also then allows the
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
committee to work on a broad range of
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder with a broad range of
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and have them at the table
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative you had a
 
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.150 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative you had a
question

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
 
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.030 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
um

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
my question is it says propose more
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted legislation
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
um which says that you're going to
 
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
actually propose legislation wouldn't
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
that say may propose or could propose uh
 
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
instead of saying that you're actually
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to propose I'm just asking
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
no I think that's a fair point uh
 
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.710 align:start position:0%
no I think that's a fair point uh
representative

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the goal is to
 
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
um I think the goal is to
um

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
put forward potential pieces of
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
legislation so that we can work side by
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
side with those in the solid waste
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
working group as well as then to have
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
input from stakeholders
 
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.590 align:start position:0%
input from stakeholders
um

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.350 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we had discussed uh in in
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
a discussion about this
 
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.190 align:start position:0%
a discussion about this
Amendment

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
um that both line 22 and 24 was going to
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
be saying suggesting rather than
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
proposing okay so I don't know if we
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
would have time to
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to uh look to see if
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
I could get that word changed from uh
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
from proposed to suggest in line 24 yeah
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
is that is that the question
 
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.260 align:start position:0%
if I can I'm happy to or representative
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
how would you want to word that
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
differently and since
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair sorry about that
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
um it says here suggests possible
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
legislation and or rules for
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
implementing approaches and then I think
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
it should be May propose or could
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
propose but proposing means that it's
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
definitely going to happen where it
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to happen we
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
could suggest we can do that I mean so
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 really take care of that
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
entire section if you think about it
 
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.389 align:start position:0%
entire section if you think about it
okay

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
um you would want to add in the word may
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative come tomorrow okay
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering if line 22 and
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
then line 24 are very similar
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
um because I think they're kind of
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
redundant in a way because line 22 says
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
suggest possible legislation and or
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
rules for implementing approaches that
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be readily adaptable to New
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then it goes proposed more
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted study legislation
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
um but if we're going to already suggest
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
possible legislation or rule changes do
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
we really need that line in there yeah
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
so I I agree I think that probably line
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 could be just eliminated
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I I was reading that and I
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I I think
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
um I had to read it several times to
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
understand it but I think the first one
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh line 22 is suggesting possible
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
legislation and then line 24 is proposed
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
proposed more specifically targeted
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
study legislation so the one is uh
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
suggest possible legislation which I
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
understand could come out of that and
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
then I think what they're also saying is
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
because this is such you know a broad
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
and and difficult subject that they want
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
to propose more uh more targeted study
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislation so another study committee
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
may come out of that so I think that's
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
the difference and you don't see that uh
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
line 22 and 23 would cover that you know
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I also know that we also have a solid
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
waste working group that works on all of
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
these issues and I don't think that this
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
particular group needs to worry about
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
that because the solid waste working
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
group which encompasses a lot a much
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
broader scope of things could come
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
before people or do the suggestion or
 
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.069 align:start position:0%
before people or do the suggestion or
proposing

00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
the way that I think about him chair and
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
the way that I read it um it seems like
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
20 line 22 number five
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
is talking about
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh either legislation or rules and
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
rules being a different you know coming
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
from a different source so that I think
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
that is a an important distinction
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and also that that number six on line
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 they're talking about looking
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
further forward to legislate things that
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
are difficult so the first one is
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
readily uh implemented and the other is
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
difficult to implement and I think that
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
um it's not unfair to ask them to to
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
have two deliverables
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative nebb
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I mean I just want
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
to agree with that I think um to the
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
point you've made in past conversations
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
there will be things that are easy to
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
tackle and there will be things that
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
will be much more complicated and I view
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
it as line 22 is is speaking to those
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
things that are sort of late low-hanging
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
fruit in terms of starting to work on
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um producer responsibility and line 24
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
is is acknowledging that there are going
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
to be these more complicated items that
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
will require further study
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:26.449 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
um

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:26.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
oh I sure had a question
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
well go ahead representative Creighton
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am
 
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.250 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am
um

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah the way I read this is a study is a
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
subset of legislation and if you put
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislation in on 22 then study is
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
inherently part of it and it's up to the
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee to decide how they want to
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
deal with that whether they want to
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
recommend a study legislation or where
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
they want to recommend a
 
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
specific act I think I think six in my
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that sick could probably
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
go away line 24 and 25 and still be
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
covered in five
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
um I agree and I think that because
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying this report is due out
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
November 1st to have suggest possible
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and what they're going to be
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
studying and then to more Target I mean
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're actually broadening the
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
scope of what they're doing in in a
 
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:30.980 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time I think
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
it was discussed that we would do the
 
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
it was discussed that we would do the
suggest

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
um because we really need to focus on uh
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
what we could do immediately and that's
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
why we were forming the study committee
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
because to take some of the workload off
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:54.620 align:start position:0%
chair um would it be agreeable if uh
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
based on the comments that we were
 
00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:57.410 align:start position:0%
based on the comments that we were
hearing

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
to Simply say at the end of line 23 and
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
may propose uh topics for further study
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds fine would would that
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
be agreeable
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
if I can get that changed okay yep
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
and then removing lines 23 or it's 24
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
and 25. yes okay
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
and change the word examine and then if
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
they can get an amendment uh done for us
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
by the time we come back for exec
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
session I hope maybe we'll do my very
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments about
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think we can move on to uh
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh we could move on to uh HB 56 and talk
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so for HB 56 there's also an
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
amendment being brought forward
 
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.810 align:start position:0%
amendment being brought forward
um

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
by representative Murray
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd like her to explain that to the
 
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
and I'd like her to explain that to the
committee

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
everybody has copies of that by the way
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven seven two h
 
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.110 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven seven two h
um

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
I wanted to based on the conversations
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we had last week regarding hb602
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
which we have retained correct Madam
 
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.150 align:start position:0%
which we have retained correct Madam
chair

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
yes and also
 
00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:53.330 align:start position:0%
yes and also
um

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
the HB 56 which we had a work session on
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
um had wanted to make sure that I first
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
addressed that um we had a long
 
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
conversation about the ability for the
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
Department to have some flexibility in
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
being able to establish some rule-making
 
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.210 align:start position:0%
being able to establish some rule-making
Authority

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
and I perhaps did not do um the best job
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
of highlighting that facet which it was
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
already in the original proposed
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendment you had last week
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
um which was um sub paragraph D lines 22
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
through 30. so I want to draw your
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
attention there
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
um in which it does give the um the
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
department some opportunities it
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
specifically says the department May
 
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.770 align:start position:0%
specifically says the department May
adopt

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh rules under RSA 541a to allow for the
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
use of project Improvement allowances
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
that may enable a project to meet the
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
minimum five-year setback even if it is
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
located less than a five-year distance
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
of travel estimate to a Surface body of
 
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.390 align:start position:0%
of travel estimate to a Surface body of
water

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
so in that to that end that was a large
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
part of our discussion there are things
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
that the department May in the rule
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
um making Authority determine are
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial and go above and beyond the
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
scope of what they normally see
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so I thought that that was an
 
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
and so I thought that that was an
important

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
aspect to make sure that I noted I also
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw your attention to line 30
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
where we had the scrivener's notation
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
that needed the small superscript
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
negative five and I had that um
 
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.590 align:start position:0%
negative five and I had that um
clarified

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
I also then um listening to uh
 
00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:28.909 align:start position:0%
I also then um listening to uh
representative

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
um Simon and some of the folks who were
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
discussing aspects of hb602 felt like
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
online like eight and a half through ten
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
that the department shall not issue a
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
license to a facility with a footprint
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
that overlies a significant sand and
 
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
gravel aquifer
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
so um that is one aspect that I felt was
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that we were in
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
for representative Murray
 
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.100 align:start position:0%
we have director wimsat with us from Des
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
and I would call him up please to help
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
good morning director wimsat how are you
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair very well thank
 
00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:20.930 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair very well thank
you

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
um I I did give you a copy of this
 
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.570 align:start position:0%
um I I did give you a copy of this
amendment

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:25.580 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to get a your feedback on
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh in your thoughts about uh some of the
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
sure um well again I for the record Mike
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
wimsad director of the waste management
 
00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire des and thank
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
you I did just receive a copy of the
 
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.130 align:start position:0%
you I did just receive a copy of the
amendment

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:52.730 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
I guess uh
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I may have misunderstood it and you
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
may have said this representative Murray
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like the amendment has
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
very similar language relative to the uh
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
project Improvement allowances that the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
original Bill had is that is that
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
correct yeah I just want to make sure
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't read anything very
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
different in that so I don't have
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
anything to offer with respect to that
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the amendment
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the introductory
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
paragraph on uh line nine
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the reference to uh not issuing a
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
license to any facility with a footprint
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
that overlies the significant sand and
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
gravel aquifer I think there would need
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
to be in some kind of a definition of
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that because that that it's not clear
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
what that
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
specifically would refer to and
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the agency would need to know
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means if it were to
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate in particular permit
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
application to make sure that it either
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
did or didn't comport without
 
00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:50.930 align:start position:0%
did or didn't comport without
requirement

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.750 align:start position:0%
requirement
foreign

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
 
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.810 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
um

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
section D on line 29 it says that no
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
allowances shall be given for a site
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
where any measurement made of in-situ
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
soils within the property has an
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
undisturbed hydraulic conductivity
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
greater than equal to 1 times 10 to the
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
minus fifth centimeters per second I
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
think that's very similar to the
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
language in the introductory Bill and as
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill in the bill is introduced and
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
as I think I mentioned during the
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
previous work session uh we have some
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
concerns because you could absolutely do
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
one in-situ sample at one location and
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
see a hydraulic conductivity that's
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
higher than that it would not
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent really have any
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
relationship to how long it would take
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
for groundwater to travel from the site
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
to a surface water body but if you had
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
that measurement in hand you'd have to
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
say you can't have a permit here
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a little too we feel
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
that's too restrictive because I think
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
that could
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
inadvertently result in
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
sites being eliminated that were
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise quite quite appropriate for
 
00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.690 align:start position:0%
otherwise quite quite appropriate for
landfill

00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.610 align:start position:0%
landfill
okay

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
I representative now
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
did you want to ask a question no go
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
ahead and then I have oh okay thank you
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
so is your concern
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
Ed um
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
travel in a direction that wouldn't be
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
toward the body of water that could be
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
one example but but even more more
 
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.110 align:start position:0%
one example but but even more more
generally

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
um because of the variability and the
 
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
heterogeneity of our of a for of our
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
soil formations in in at sites where
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
landfill would would be uh developed
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
you can absolutely I mean I I would
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
venture to Guess that at every single
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
site where a landfill is currently cited
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
there are soils in place that would test
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
out in an in-situ hydraulic conductivity
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
test at greater than 10 to the minus
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
centimeters per second at a higher
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
velocity than that it doesn't mean that
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
that is contiguous and that sub that
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
that there would be a meaningful
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
possibility that groundwater that was
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
you know the contaminated groundwater
 
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:07.700 align:start position:0%
contaminants in groundwater could travel
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
at that speed throughout their Pathway
 
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
to a surface water it's just not okay
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
the current situation is have a
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure do you have a suggested
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
change to that is that the rate of speed
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
is concerning to you or would you want
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
more test points where it would have to
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
be a certain number of them would reach
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
that rate of speed I think if you're
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
going to use that as a as a metric you
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
need to you need to require that a more
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis of the actual
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
pathway of the of the of the hydraulic
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
conductivity of the soils as a unit and
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that takes more extensive testing
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly more than one data point
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
and I think this essentially suggests
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
one data point would be determinative
 
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
rules though isn't it my understanding
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
that when you're taking those test
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
points you can determine how many of
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
certainly those kinds of tests are made
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
and and yes at some level someone always
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
has to decide how many but that's not
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
what this says that's that's what I'm
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm offering my my analysis based on
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
what the the sentence the way I read the
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
sentence way I understand it and the way
 
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
I understand that sentence if an
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
applicant goes and takes 50 tests of
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity and 49 of them
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
are much more
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh much less conductive than 10 to the
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
minus fifth centimeters per second but
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
one of them is greater than that then
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
the site is excluded from from
 
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.909 align:start position:0%
the site is excluded from from
consideration

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you this and the rate
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
centimeters per second that that is
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
directly related to the length of time
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
it takes that contaminated water to
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
reach that three-year period
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
uh it's important to understand that
 
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's part of it's part of a groundwater
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
velocity equation so when you read soils
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
is say 10 to the minus 10 minus
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
centimeters per second that doesn't
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
automatically relate to that's the
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
velocity of the groundwater it's
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
dependent on hydraulic head difference
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
across two points it's dependent on um
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know a number of factors that that
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
that essentially determine that but so
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
my point at the demand for check the
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up so what I'm trying to get at
 
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.049 align:start position:0%
follow-up so what I'm trying to get at
is

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
that by saying three years in the
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
previous paragraph on line 28
 
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.930 align:start position:0%
previous paragraph on line 28
.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
.
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
um what that is defining is how close we
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
want it to be
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to you guys to figure
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
out how fast that water travels based on
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
the soil conditions so as we took out
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
those last two lines
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
you've still got to figure out the
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
three-year Point absolutely yes is that
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
three year Point reasonable
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
oh is that reasonable and you know as I
 
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:01.820 align:start position:0%
think I've indicated in prior testimony
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know because we don't we don't
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of information about
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
him and we don't know about a future
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
site that might be
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
proposed it's just hard to say what it
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
would relate we don't know at this point
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
how many sites would be eliminated from
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
by a a standard like that and we just
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to it
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
um director wimsat if you would please
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
describe to the committee
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
the kinds of rules you already have in
 
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.250 align:start position:0%
the kinds of rules you already have in
place

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:42.260 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.850 align:start position:0%
place
which

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
which
um

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:48.020 align:start position:0%
take into consideration the hydro
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
hydrological studies I mean you know I
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
guess I'm looking at
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
um some testimony that
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
um Adam Finkel had brought to the
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
um several landfills that we already
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
have he said the majority of landfills
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire relies on today would
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
likely have passed the HB 56 test
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
of our state's large three large land
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
active landfills two of them are located
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
in soils where groundwater Flows at one
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
foot a day or less only the proposed
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
Alton site well he goes into that but
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
but he's saying that mount carvery
 
00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:32.539 align:start position:0%
TurnKey Bethlehem
 
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:36.860 align:start position:0%
they all had these uh
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
these um
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
in it would have already it would have
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
passed the test so to speak and so I'm
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
thinking then that our rules that we
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
already have in place are adequate
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
enough to be safe for these landfills
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
am I am I wrong in that thinking well
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question I to be candid I
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know how anyone necessarily
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
unless they have access to an awful lot
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
of data and Analysis knows whether or
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
not those facilities would meet this
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
particular standard there's been a lot
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
of testimony in that regard but again I
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
and again it said likely I don't know
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
how likely it is I don't know the answer
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
to that um I guess to answer the second
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
part of your question
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the the rules require
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
um the site specific you know or the uh
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
the standard setback that's been
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
discussed but that's a minimum and then
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
there's also General language that
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
um a complete hydrogeologic study be
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
conducted and that the agencies should
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
not approve a permit or a landfill
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
citing that is not protective of surface
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater and as I've
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier we we really focus on
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
the groundwater because the groundwater
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
is right there immediately at the
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
landfill boundary it's right you know
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
land groundwater is essentially
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
everywhere in New Hampshire right so if
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
you cite a landfill there's groundwater
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
under the landfill there's groundwater
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent to the landfill and
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
we focus our protections on that I think
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
by default the surface waters end up
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
being protected because we're so focused
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
on groundwater protection
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and and monitoring to ensure
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
groundwater protection and a whole
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
series of procedures that occur when we
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
detect and increase in background
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
concentrations of any contaminant
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent to a landfill that
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's really what provides that
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
protection for surface water because
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're if you protect the groundwater
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
you're protecting the surface water
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
essentially and and it does also require
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
that we make a determination that the
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
landfill siding is protective of surface
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
water but again I think in practice the
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
way that happens is through US ensuring
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
that we can protect groundwater and that
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have and that we're able to monitor
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
both groundwater and surface water
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
impacts over time on an ongoing basis
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
we have been working on something to
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
this end for quite some time and I think
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
that it is really important to remember
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
that what we are asking for is for this
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
to be set in statute versus rules just a
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
minimum commitment to saying that we
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that there is a level
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is the bare minimum set in statute
 
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:30.260 align:start position:0%
there are other things that may then
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
seek to exceed protections set forth and
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
rules but currently we don't have
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
anything set forth in statute other than
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
that arbitrary 200 foot setback
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
and director wimsat do you find that the
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
rules that we have in place now are they
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
compatible with this statute
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
that we're considering this bill that
 
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
we're considering the bill
 
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.049 align:start position:0%
we're considering the bill
um

00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I'd say is that they
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
impose additional restrictions that are
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
not necessarily contained in the statute
 
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.289 align:start position:0%
not necessarily contained in the statute
um

00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm not sure I completely
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
understand your questions so we're
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
considering this HB 56 and its Amendment
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering whether the rules that
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
we currently have in place are
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
compatible with what we're considering
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
in this legislation in other words
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
um would we have to change significantly
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
the rules that we already have in order
 
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.649 align:start position:0%
the rules that we already have in order
to

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:32.659 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
abide by what we're seeking to put in
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
statute yes if a bill if HB 56 were to
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
pass and be enacted into law we would
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
have to significantly change the rules
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
to implement those very specific
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
requirements would the rules then be
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
have to have to be made more stringent
 
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
have to have to be made more stringent
um

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
I think I think that they would be more
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
stringent I mean if we were to adopt the
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
specific Provisions in this they would
 
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:01.460 align:start position:0%
those rules would be more stringent yes
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh and thank you director for
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to follow
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
up on a question that was asked by uh
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative of Creighton about uh you
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
know would the three-year rule
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
um for example be uh reasonable right uh
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
and your answer was if I jotted this
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
down correctly we don't know how many
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
sites would be eliminated right if we
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
were to adopt that rule but isn't that
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
always the case when you have a rule I
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
mean isn't actually that kind of the
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
point of making a rule is that you don't
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
know ahead of time exactly how many
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
sites are going to be affected and
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's why the test has to be done in
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
the first place so whether it's a
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
minimum of 200 feet or if it is a
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
three-year rule that the same answer
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
would apply that we don't know uh a
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
priori which sites are going to be
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
affected and which are not
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent I think that's true
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
but I think in the case of this bill
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
um the senses it could be substantial it
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
could the concern that we've expressed
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the past is that without knowing for
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
sure how this would play out
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
um in in practice we don't know if it
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
would substantially reduce the the
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
number of the the availability of
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
available eligible sites for landfill
 
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
available eligible sites for landfill
citing

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair director wimsat
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
that there may come a time
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
sooner than later where a landfill site
 
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.710 align:start position:0%
sooner than later where a landfill site
requires

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
we update the rules so that we don't
 
00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:45.859 align:start position:0%
have a situation that the current rules
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't cover it's an old rule and I think
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
we're here because there may come sooner
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
than later a proposed site that requires
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
additional protection
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
and to put it in statute
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
gives you the wherewithal to recognize
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
that we may need to adjust the rules
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
somewhat and update them for a site that
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
previously covered as in TurnKey carvery
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding your your question
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
correctly certainly the agency believes
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
that continual evaluation of the rules
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
and how they're working and how they how
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
they're applied in the current situation
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
and prospective future situations is an
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
important part of what we do and what
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
and what the legislature does and
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean I think it's important
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
to understand though that
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
when a bill is passed if it's very
 
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.190 align:start position:0%
when a bill is passed if it's very
prescriptive

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
the agencies
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
discretion is basically eliminated at
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
that point if if the rule is very
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
prescriptive about how a particular
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
thing is implemented we just simply make
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
a rule that says the same thing or in
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
some cases we even just refer to the
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
statute in the rule we don't even
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
restate it
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
so it it there's a I think in some cases
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
folks think we're going to take
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
whatever's passed and then try to
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
interpret it and and uh and get creative
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the rules but that's not when the
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
rule is very prescriptive that's not
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
what happens we essentially Implement
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
that prescriptive requirement we may do
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
it through rulemaking but it's it's
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
basically taken directly verbatim from
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
the statute I understand I defer to my
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues for a follow-up
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative dutse
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
I have been frustrated by the argument
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
that I have been hearing that if we pass
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
um our hands will be we will be
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
hamstrung as a department
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
if that in fact is true and if every law
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
that we pass may have the opportunity
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
has to be followed to the letter of the
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
law then I would ask why am I seeing a
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
solid waste report
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that by law was supposed to be
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
updated in I believe 2008.
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I think we are I mean I I think we
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
are using that argument to discredit
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
these stringent aspects of this law
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
which many people feel is has been more
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
than needed so
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's my frustration
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments on that and
 
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments on that and
representative

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
um director wimsat
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
with the focus on groundwater which to
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
me is is
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important because groundwater
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
feeds everything whether it be surface
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
water whatever in its precipitation that
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of our surface water as
 
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:01.820 align:start position:0%
does the ground water
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
and as you stated by monitoring the
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater you're also monitoring the
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
surface water is that a correct
 
00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:10.310 align:start position:0%
surface water is that a correct
statement

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
certainly the groundwater data is very
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
relevant to nearby surface water quality
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
certainly and but I will point out that
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
we do have a number of landfills that
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
are situated in proximity to rivers and
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
we do monitor the river water quality as
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
well so there's monitoring in both the
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater and the river river water
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you madam chair
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
so even though our rules are older
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
we are continually monitoring and if my
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct
 
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.329 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct
um

00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
you would like to see a two-year study
 
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.770 align:start position:0%
you would like to see a two-year study
done

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:47.780 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we Encompass our our
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
geological differences in New Hampshire
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
compared to other states to make sure we
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
properly implement the rules and the
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislation to make this the best
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
possible we can is that correct yes we
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
we believe that the study the other
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
another bill that does propose that a
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
study be done would be really helpful to
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
us it's clear to us that that folks are
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the current status
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
of our surface water setback criteria
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
and our citing criteria and there's a
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
lot of of looking around at neighboring
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
states and their specific requirements
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and that's a complicated business
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
because whenever you look at rules or
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
the law in another jurisdiction it's
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
those have to be read in the context of
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that jurisdiction's entire body of
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
Law and rules so it's not just a simple
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
oh well they do this so we could do the
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
same thing and we believe that review of
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
our current rules and and the way that
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
we Implement Implement them along with
 
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:52.820 align:start position:0%
the review of neighboring states
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
approaches to this would be very helpful
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
and informative to the department as it
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
embarks on uh proposing new rules that
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
that would address citing criteria
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
um one
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that the 200 feet is a minimum
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
I also in my experience feel that if a
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
developer or business wants the minimum
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
they will do everything in their power
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
to get the minimum and they will throw
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
law into the lawyers into that they will
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
throw their own experts into that and I
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
feel like this bill gives CES a little
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit more coverage to be able to say that
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
they want a further setback I don't I
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
hope no one in this room thinks 200 feet
 
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate minimum because I
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
certainly don't
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
um the second thing I'll say is that
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative datsey made a really good
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
point last week that you we can find a
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist I think to say we need a
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
mile and a hydrogeologist to say 200
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
feet is fine and the process of going
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
through this two-year study seems to
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
involve an RFP that hires a consultant
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
that makes recommendations and I'm
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
really concerned that we could easily
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
find a hydrogeologist that says
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
everything's fine as it is let's leave
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
it and I don't think this committee
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
wants to be in that place in two years
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
of having a recommendation coming back
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
to us that's it's fine as it is let's
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
leave it as it is I don't think that
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
people are comfortable with that and
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's my concern turn with the
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
alternative process that has been laid
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
out in doing a two-year study it's
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
pushing this down the road when we've
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
had 30 years to get a better process
 
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray uh thank
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh to to your point
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
I I think that we also want to make sure
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
giving the state the opportunity like
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned to have a little bit
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
more clarity in in statute as well as
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
the protection for the people who are
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
out here asking for protection of their
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
in statute of their water quality and
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
their water to represent a contrast
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
Point groundwater is important and I
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
think that folks before this committee
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
several times have said if we don't have
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
clean water
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have much of anything else
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's really what
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're asking for to be the focus here
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
when we're asking for
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
um something to be put in statute versus
 
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.950 align:start position:0%
um something to be put in statute versus
rules

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
director wimsat for your your comments I
 
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.329 align:start position:0%
director wimsat for your your comments I
just

00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
not really just a statement in my mind I
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
live on a river my business involves
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
fresh water and fishing and all that and
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
so we we drink our own well water so I'm
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
well aware of the importance of that
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
what I don't want to do though is rush
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
to failure and what I'm hearing from
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
from the director is that there are
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
we have a direct interest in maintaining
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
Safe Water
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
but what I don't want to do is jump to
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
push the button and have unintended
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
consequences to where we say hey do this
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden it's like well you
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
told us to do that well how come why did
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
this happen well I don't think we have
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
enough information to say that if we
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
push the button
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
that something that we don't intend to
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
happen will happen and and I know you've
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
been a lot longer than I have I got it
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
ma'am I got it I'm I'm new I was on Rod
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
last year so I but what I don't want to
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
do is punch that button and then a bunch
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
of stuff happens that I don't want to
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
have happen yes ma'am all right sure
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we have been
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with this for a long time and I
 
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
dealing with this for a long time and I
think

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
were some of us who have been on this
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
committee I mean it's really head
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
scratching to see what we went through
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
for two years and the representatives
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
that we had who jump through hoops to
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
make this a good bill and it was a good
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
bill and it had a great Bic partisan
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
support in the house last year we even
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
overrode the governor's veto and all of
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden the same bill
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
and the only changes that were made were
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
to appease the governor okay so it's the
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's basically the same bill and all of
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
a sudden we're getting all of this
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
pushback and it seems to me the only
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
reason we're getting the pushback is
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
that there's another bill in the works
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
that would allow the can to be kicked
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
down the road two more years and so you
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
know uh with all due respect I I
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
honestly don't think we're rushing to
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
judgment a lot of work I wasn't involved
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
in it but a lot of work was done on this
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill in the past two years
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I just want to
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
add one thing is that my my issue is
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
regarding and and I think there's a lot
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
of really good positive aspects
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill and its Amendment but I'm
 
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
of this bill and its Amendment but I'm
really

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
I'm really torn with a statement that
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
was made by um Nikki Dillard Roy one of
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
the people who testified who said that
 
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
use and consideration of a single
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
highest measurement is not
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative of a real field geologic
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
and and I believe uh director wimsat had
 
00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:01.069 align:start position:0%
and and I believe uh director wimsat had
also

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
um alluded to that
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if by putting that in
 
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:10.970 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if by putting that in
place

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
we are then eliminating a lot of sites
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate and um
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
chair um to that point uh you know I I
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
understand your perspective and that is
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
Food For Thought when we're thinking
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
about this but I also happen to wonder
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
um when you look at other things like
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
standards for other types of safety
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
measures they often err on the side of
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
caution and public health and safety
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
first and put into protection the the
 
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:44.930 align:start position:0%
first and put into protection the the
um

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
highest level of safety first and I
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
think that to that end that's what we're
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
asking to make sure that we have because
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
the EPA doesn't say these might you know
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
liners might leak it's as if and when
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
they will leak and I think that we want
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have that five
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
years of that buffer so that we're never
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with another situation like this
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
and so to that end uh Madam chair I
 
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.210 align:start position:0%
and so to that end uh Madam chair I
respectfully

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
um posit that as food for thought as
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
well representative nav
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
um I just had one other comment which is
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
to piggyback on what representative
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
Murray was saying to me I think you know
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
your first thing is making sure these
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
things don't leak right that's the most
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
important thing and then the second
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
thing is making sure if they do leak
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
which they will that we have enough time
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
to work on it and the third piece is
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
monitoring and there's been a lot of
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
emphasis from the Des about the
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring and Remediation but you know
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
I live in a town with a pfest problem no
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
one talks about cleaning up the pfas
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
they talk about giving people point of
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
entry Water Systems you can't put these
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
things back once they've gotten out and
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
in a landfill you're talking about not
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
just pfas but heavy metals and other
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants that there's no real
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
remediation you cannot get these things
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
back into the landfill once they are in
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
your soil and your water it's impossible
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's an impossible task so you know
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
monitoring and Remediation are important
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
but to me they're sort of the last piece
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
and here we are addressing the middle
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
piece of what happens when there is a
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
leak and how much time do we have to
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
address it and how how many ways can we
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
consider protecting our water bodies of
 
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.710 align:start position:0%
consider protecting our water bodies of
water

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.349 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
datsey

00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
datsey
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I mean I
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
think we're in a real Dilemma on this
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
um if I would look at this bill and I
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
would basically say we have a major
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholder which is des and I would say
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
bring Des into the into the fold and and
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
have them make suggestions but from what
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing is des does not feel
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
that it has the expertise in order to do
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
that so we're left with the situation
 
00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:46.099 align:start position:0%
that you have dueling
 
00:48:46.099 --> 00:48:47.770 align:start position:0%
that you have dueling
hydrogeologists

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:47.780 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
and we're getting conflicting
 
00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:50.770 align:start position:0%
and we're getting conflicting
information

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:50.780 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
and and I will admit it's a it's a real
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
dilemma I think for this committee to
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
try to figure out what the right formula
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
is is very difficult but the fact of the
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
matter is these dueling hydrologists for
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
the last two years have been battling it
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
out and this is the bill that we came up
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
with that was passed and since Des has
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
already said it does not have the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
expertise to properly
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
um advise us on this why not go forward
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
with this bill and laws can be changed
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't work out and if it's
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
hamstrung I think this committee would
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
be very willing to come back you know to
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
listen to Des based on the experience
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
that they're now having because it's in
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
all of us our best interests to cite
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
these landfills in the most appropriate
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
way and I mean I don't think we want to
 
00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
way and I mean I don't think we want to
be

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
work you know we don't want to be
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
working with against Des we want to be
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
working with you but if the expertise
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
isn't there
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
and clearly we're not defining any
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
expertise we have dueling expertise I
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
would say go forward with the bill and
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
make changes if needed and we've done
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
that you know we do that on an annual
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
basis with other bills representative
 
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.970 align:start position:0%
basis with other bills representative
Howard

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I we all
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
received a rather impassioned email from
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
constituent and one of the points that
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
she made I I share and that is that
 
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
regulation is about this is to quote her
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
about being protective of the
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
environment and there's nothing wrong
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
with using the maximum value measured
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
for a calculation
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
um I I think you know to the point
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's been made earlier
 
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
that's been made earlier
um

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we when it comes to protecting
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
the environment and human health
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be airing on the side of
 
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.670 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be airing on the side of
caution

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
caution
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative germano
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I I have a
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
question that I was thinking about last
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
week as well and it connects with some
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
of the points that I agree with that
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
that representative Creighton has raised
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
I always want to have as much uh data
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know to to work with as possible to
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
make sure that our laws are based as
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
much as they can be in in solid science
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
no pun intended but
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
um what I'm wondering about when we talk
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
about if we take a rule that applies say
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the state of Maine or a law in the
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
state of Maine we apply it in New
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I understand that if we look
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
at 602 I think that's an example where
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in that it's
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
very deeply embedded in statute and rule
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
in Maine there's a case where I think
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
that would be problematic in this case
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
though the question I have in terms of
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
what kinds of information we would hope
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
to get from more hydrogeological studies
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you can can explain to me
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
why I'm confused about this or or
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong for for given types of
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
of say Bedrock or clay or gravel and I
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
apologize for my highly inaccurate and
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
you know user geological terms but isn't
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
there there there's kind of a value in
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
the sense of if we describe something as
 
00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
the sense of if we describe something as
bedrock

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
bedrock
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
it has a certain defined value in terms
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
for example of how quickly water is
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
going to move through bedrock as opposed
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
to clay or gravel or silt
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
Etc right the composition the density
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Etc of that layer of Earth has a
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
particular value and I don't believe
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
that that value is different in Maine
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
than it is in New Hampshire our strata
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
may be different right so when we drill
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to find different amounts of
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
Bedrock clay silt gravel Etc but the
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
value that we would use to calculate the
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
seepage velocity is not going to be
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
different in main Bedrock as it is in
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bedrock so I have a
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
difficult time understanding how more
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological studies are going to
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
change those basic facts which brings me
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
back to the belief that that velocity
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
from the source to the groundwater
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
measured in time is a much more accurate
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
way of measuring setback than distance
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
which as you all know you've heard me
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
say a few times is actually a measure of
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
time so am I mistaken in saying that
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
different types of
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
Earth have different values in terms of
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
water transmission and that's not going
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
to be different in Maine than in New
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well actually
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
um I mean first of all I've acknowledged
 
00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
I think in Prior questions and answers
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
the idea of using time of travel is not
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
agency doesn't have to necessarily have
 
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:43.940 align:start position:0%
any objection to that
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
to go to your first question about you
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
know even Bedrock Bedrock how fast or
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
whether water moves through bedrock is
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
different depending on the bedrock in in
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
bedrock in New Hampshire is different in
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
different places in New Hampshire in
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
some places very little water will move
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
through it if it's very competent rock
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
with very low levels of fracturing other
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
areas where it may be very weathered and
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
fractured water may move very readily
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
through bedrock so it is very
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
site-specific even if you have a
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
particular type of medium whether it's
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
Bedrock or till or shell or or um or
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
gravel or sand all of those things have
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
a range of hydraulic conductivity
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
till they're still Bedrock but there may
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
be a wide range of hydraulic
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
conductivity in a particular unit so it
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
is very specific to the formation and to
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
the particular site so just just to be
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
clear on that
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
um so when I've spoken previously about
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
concerns about using rules from another
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
state you know we we haven't done a lot
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
of analysis on this but our staff have
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
spent some time talking with staff from
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine and it isn't clear to
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
me that that that rule the rules that
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
are that are being cited here and and
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
suggested for inclusion in New Hampshire
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
are necessarily implemented in Wayne in
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
Maine in the way that this committee
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
thinks they are because there are other
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
factors that are different about our
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
rules and it occurs it appears to us and
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
again this is based on a minimal amount
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
of analysis and and communication that
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
in reality
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
um the way those rules are constructed
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the way they're implemented doesn't
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
really result in the result that I think
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
this committee is expecting from that
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
and and by that I mean that uh the the
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh allowances
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
um for uh for the time of travel in
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
Maine maybe things that that are already
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
required by New Hampshire rules that
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
would not get you any additional time of
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
travel allowance in New Hampshire
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
um the variance opportunities that they
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
have for various requirements are not
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist in New
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law so it's just all I was
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
trying to say from that is that it's
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
very hazardous to just take a particular
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
set of rules
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
from another state and drop them into
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
another State's entire legal and Rule
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
law and Rule Paradigm because you can't
 
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.589 align:start position:0%
law and Rule Paradigm because you can't
always

00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
you you can't be sure that the result
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
will be what you think it is it takes a
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
lot of analysis for that the agency
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
um does believe that it has the uh
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
expertise and the ability to evaluate
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
this question but we do think we need a
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
couple years to do it right and we would
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
like to have the additional benefit of a
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
third party taking an Eyes Wide Open
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
look at our rules in neighboring states
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
rules and giving us opinions on that we
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
may not agree with those opinions or are
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
we very likely we would take some of
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
them and maybe discard others because we
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't find them to be valid you know I
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
don't want to judge a study before it's
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
been done but
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we think that that
 
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.569 align:start position:0%
um we think that that
um

00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
in order to do the careful analysis to
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
and to to arrive at a place where we all
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
can say we have a set of citing rules
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
with respect to surface water setbacks
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
that are appropriate and protective in
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we think it's going to
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
take some time to do that properly
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you in the interest of time and
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
seeing where the time is at I would just
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
like to say that it is my opinion that
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
this is actually very pro-business in
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the sense that it makes it very clear
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
about where to even begin looking to
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
start an initial point of citing through
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
exploration because this is actually
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
requiring a third-party hydrogeologist
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
to take a look at where the siding would
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
meet that five-year distance travel and
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
if that isn't met then they can look
 
00:57:49.809 --> 00:57:49.819 align:start position:0%
elsewhere immediately to begin
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeking an alternate more suitable place
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
to cite their landfill
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Haskins and
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
just a final comment
 
00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:00.049 align:start position:0%
just a final comment
um

00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
with respect this is not talking about
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
602 this is an attempt to update uh a
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
situation which is a 30 year old Rule
 
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:15.020 align:start position:0%
and there is going to be pressure to
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
cite a landfill
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
in other areas that perhaps we have not
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
had to deal with before so this is
 
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.500 align:start position:0%
protective this is an update
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
to study it is to definitely Kick the
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
Can down the road because we have been
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
here before and we're trying to give the
 
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
department a standard which we believe
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
can be met and will be protective and
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
the department can spend the time
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
developing the rules to follow
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
what the statute will say
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
Compton did you have a question no no
 
00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.190 align:start position:0%
Compton did you have a question no no
um

00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.930 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I know we don't want to talk about
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
this other bill that we haven't even
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
read yet that's supposedly coming from
 
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall
 
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.530 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall
um

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
but I mean there I would think that
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
there is really nothing that says that
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
um you know both bills wouldn't be
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate I mean we could we could put
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
something into statute now and have some
 
00:59:24.609 --> 00:59:24.619 align:start position:0%
other studies being done in in tandem
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
and then come back and after these
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
studies are done and re-examine what we
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
have in statute and make appropriate
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
changes is that what's anybody's
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:42.770 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
um

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I I think that
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
we want to end this work session unless
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
anybody has anything other significant
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
points to make I know we've talked about
 
00:59:55.569 --> 00:59:55.579 align:start position:0%
this to death already
 
00:59:58.089 --> 00:59:58.099 align:start position:0%
I am going to
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
recess the community close the work
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
session recess this committee so that um
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%

Madam chair I would like to propose a
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
motion about to pass on House Bill 56.
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%

01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
and um this is our position that um
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
we feel that there is a need for
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
protection in statute to make sure that
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
our groundwater is um
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
clearly and definitively protected thank
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
you representative Contour thank you
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe the Des is doing a good job
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
with what they're doing in monitoring we
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
are constantly their rules state that we
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
are to monitor the groundwater
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
which is extremely important
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
and we know that other states who have
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
this five-year travel setback
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
do not require double liners as does the
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and we know that
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of exceptions in their
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
rules which if we put this into statute
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
will not will tie the hands of Des and
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking authority
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.129 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Creighton

01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am I agree completely that we
 
01:42:36.729 --> 01:42:36.739 align:start position:0%
need to protect our groundwater
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I believe that we should act to do
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
so but I do believe that this is a case
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
of ready fire aim and that we need to
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
save more time and figure out exactly
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
how we do that silver
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
I think the preceding statutes for that
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
covering this um this area are 30 years
 
01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
old there's a lot of Science in the last
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
30 years and a lot of discovery of
 
01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
things that we didn't even know about 30
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
years ago that we need to protect
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
against and I think that we need to take
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
steps now to update the law
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
I agree with what she's saying um but I
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
know that there is a bill that's coming
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
from the Senate and because of that in
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
regards with redundancy I believe that
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh that we should focus on that which is
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike soon and it's
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
better and well written representative
 
01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.189 align:start position:0%
better and well written representative
Murray

01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
on the bills before this committee if I
 
01:43:39.729 --> 01:43:39.739 align:start position:0%
may sure yes
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't really be uh thinking or
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
talking about bills that may or may not
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
come to this committee
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and and I believe that that's a valid
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
point to bring up so I just want to
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
remind our our members here
 
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.189 align:start position:0%
remind our our members here
um

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
did you want to say anything else no
 
01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:02.870 align:start position:0%
did you want to say anything else no
representative

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
for the years that I've been here
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
people have come to this committee for
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
um remedy
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
or problems
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
um inciting landfills
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
and they keep coming up empty
 
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.709 align:start position:0%
and they keep coming up empty
this

01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:22.580 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire are our
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders they they ask us to come
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
here to do a job and I might act like
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not involved in what's going on
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
but this is like the maybe the fourth
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
time I've been through this process
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
I have been up to the North country and
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
I have toured those landfills and the
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
people came
 
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
for help
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
we're gonna study it or we're going to
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
have some other thing it's not they need
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
protections and they need us to make a
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
decision the fact that Des
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
was so far behind in giving this Solid
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
Waste plan to us
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
I guess I just asked to you to think
 
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.229 align:start position:0%
I guess I just asked to you to think
about

01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
when the damage is done it's we it's
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
like trying to put the toothpaste back
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
into a toothpaste tube
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very very difficult job we have
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
one high cancer clusters in this state
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
and we can tout really uh Liberty we can
 
01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.050 align:start position:0%
and we can tout really uh Liberty we can
Tout

01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
Tout
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
lack of regulations we can
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
um deregulate everything but things
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
don't come
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
the way of the small people
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
the of these small towns who don't have
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
um big budgets to protect themselves and
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
so I just would ask
 
01:46:05.639 --> 01:46:07.310 align:start position:0%
so I just would ask
that

01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is the third time I have heard this
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
bill and I would really ask people
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
to think in their hearts
 
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.830 align:start position:0%
to think in their hearts
about

01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
your children your grandchildren
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
and instead of thinking about a company
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
or a business
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
think about the cancer clusters
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:37.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
representative smart
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:44.930 align:start position:0%
think that
um

01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
I agree with protection and
 
01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.090 align:start position:0%
I agree with protection and
um

01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
making you know what once something
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
happens it's too late kind of thing I
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
agree with that but I think that things
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
need to be site-specific I think they'll
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
one size fits all is not the way to go
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this I think it's the
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
the land is too diverse things are the
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
area is too diverse and I think we need
 
01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:14.780 align:start position:0%
to have a more
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
diverse Bill rather than one size fits
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
all That's Mike representative Haskins
 
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I agree with that
 
01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.890 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I agree with that
also

01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I do think that this bill gives Des a
 
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
standard I believe that they can meet it
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
I believe the rulemaking needs to meet
 
01:47:37.129 --> 01:47:37.139 align:start position:0%
the standard I believe that we can
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
respect the work that's gone into this
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
that it was essentially a bipartisan
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed and I I can't
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
understand why we want to roll back
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
protection and go backwards
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative germano
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and and with
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
respect genuinely man respect to to
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
Senator uh representative Smart's point
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
about site's need for site-specific
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
information I would argue this is
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
site-specific right you do tests on
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
specific sites and what in the end uh
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
happens is based upon the science that
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
is conducted with site-specific tests
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um I also want to uh
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
piggyback on something representative
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
safikidus pointed out is the argument
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
that she made that in the end we have to
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
decide who it is that we are
 
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
representing on this committee uh and in
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the house and and I think if if we do
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
that then the answer should always be to
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
err on the side of caution particularly
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
given some of the hard lessons
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
um Granite Staters have already learned
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
about these issues and finally I would
 
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
say that with the question about further
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
studies we have had ample time to
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
conduct these studies Des has had ample
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
time to conduct these studies this is
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
not a new conversation
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
um it is time for the legislature to act
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
because uh what we've seen is over and
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
over again kicking the can down the road
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
for various reasons none of which I
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
think are ultimately sustainable so the
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
studies that should have been done
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
already should have been done apparently
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
they haven't been and it's time for the
 
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
legislature to take action to put this
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
into statute and to follow through to
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that Pro appropriate actions
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
are taken thank you thank you
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to say first of all
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
I want to thank this committee for all
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
of the diligence the questions
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking comments that have
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
been made and made in a very civil and
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
helpful manner
 
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.450 align:start position:0%
helpful manner
um

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:53.420 align:start position:0%
we we've worked hard on this I know
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray worked very hard
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
on this and I want to thank you for all
 
01:49:59.689 --> 01:49:59.699 align:start position:0%
the work that everybody on this
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee has put in on to this
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
particular issue it's not an easy issue
 
01:50:07.139 --> 01:50:08.330 align:start position:0%
particular issue it's not an easy issue
um

01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
and you know when it comes down to
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
creating legislation something that's
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to be law
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's daunting for all of us I think
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
to really
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
um make that consideration and say yes
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
and I think with that we have you know
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
been very very careful in our thoughts
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
on dealing with this
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and and anybody who is voting against
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not because
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
they don't want to see
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
um you know clean water or they don't
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
want to see a
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know horrible things have they they
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know they they want all good things
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
um Des also wants to do things right and
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
do it in the best way possible
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
um we want to make sure that we have
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
state law that's not going to be binding
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
any agency's hands
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
and is going to give them the
 
01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:19.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility that they need to deal with
 
01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:20.890 align:start position:0%
flexibility that they need to deal with
situations

01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:20.900 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
as they unfold in any particular
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh landfill citing
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
um issue
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
this has been particularly difficult
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
because I do believe that change has to
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
be made
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
but I also want to be very careful with
 
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
the change that we do make
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and my hesitation with this particular
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
legislation has really been
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
again the one size fits all
 
01:51:56.649 --> 01:51:56.659 align:start position:0%
and making a prescriptive change
 
01:51:59.410 --> 01:51:59.420 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to you know
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological conditions which I know
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think that when we as a as a body
 
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.629 align:start position:0%
I think that when we as a as a body
consider

01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
using a single highest measurement that
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
may not be representative of the entire
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
site that we're treading into some very
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
difficult water
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so for me that is why
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm inclined not to vote Yes on this
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill but I
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
irrespective of that whatever my reasons
 
01:52:34.739 --> 01:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
irrespective of that whatever my reasons
are

01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
I think this committee has done an
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
amazing job an enormous job
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
considering all the pros and cons and I
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
want to thank you
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%

with that
um

01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
to come up and speak to us today from
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Council of state governments
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
they are prior chairs of this committee
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Tara said
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:54:32.689 --> 01:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
Welcome to our committee and thank you
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
for sitting through a very uh
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
interesting morning it was interesting
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we started in 2006 together we were
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
elected in 2006 and we always served on
 
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
this committee the entire 10 years we
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
were in the house and how many bills did
 
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
we have on landfill citing
 
01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
Lots and we went through the same
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
process and you know it's sort of like
 
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:01.139 align:start position:0%
we were talking about kicking the can
 
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
down the road we were some of the ones
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
that kicked it one of the original ones
 
01:55:05.639 --> 01:55:06.530 align:start position:0%
that kicked it one of the original ones
so

01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
um we are sort of disheartened to see
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
that it's still here it's still a
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
subject and it hasn't been
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
fixed but you know someone earlier said
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing this for a long
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
while well we were discussing in 2006
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
right exactly
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a tough tough tough issue
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
but one that is critically important to
 
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of the people in
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
um you did you guys did a great job I
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean the thoughtful thoughtful
 
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.609 align:start position:0%
mean the thoughtful thoughtful
um

01:55:37.609 --> 01:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
thinking that went behind it is great so
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
anyway why we're here
 
01:55:45.169 --> 01:55:45.179 align:start position:0%
um as we said I'm Tara sad this is Bob
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
Heffner I'm from Walpole
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
which is the prettiest town in the
 
01:55:52.129 --> 01:55:52.139 align:start position:0%
entire State and one with more dairy
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you you have to say
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh I'm from Hudson
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we she may have more dairy farms
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
but we've got better bottom land to
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
throw crops on
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
I'm on the Connecticut River which has
 
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
the best bottomland of any
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
we do this and have been doing it for 16
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
years now
 
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:21.770 align:start position:0%
years now
um

01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
after leaving the house we were asked to
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
join the Council of state governments
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
um does everyone know what council of
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
state governments is okay council state
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
government is a membership organization
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
that all the states in the country pay
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
membership dues to and because of that
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
we work for you we are the Agriculture
 
01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
and Rural Affairs policy consultants for
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
the Eastern region so we have 11
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
Northeastern states from Maryland
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania New York and all of New
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
England and five eastern Canadian
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
provinces and two territories Puerto
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
Rico and the Virgin Islands
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's fun to go to conferences down there
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
um especially in the winter time
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
what we do is we provide Research
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
Services for you if you need anything we
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
do conferences we do policy Summits but
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
the thing that we do most is we
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
introduce you to your compatriots in
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
you get to know who the people are in
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont who are dealing with the same
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
issues pretty much that you are here and
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
finding out what they have done about it
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
looking to see any legislation that
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
would work here or tricks to solving a
 
01:57:48.010 --> 01:57:48.020 align:start position:0%
problem because in the Northeast
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and Rural issues are pretty
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
much all the same
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
when we deal with
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
like ncsl is another organization
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
similar to us they're a National
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
Organization so if they deal with
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture they deal with Iowa they
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
deal with Oklahoma they deal with
 
01:58:07.739 --> 01:58:09.109 align:start position:0%
deal with Oklahoma they deal with
California

01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
California
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
their AG is completely different than
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
ours we're not a commodity region and so
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
we need to group together all of our 11
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
states and come up with legislation that
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
works for us and then Lobby the federal
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
government when they're dealing with the
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
farm bill which is in negotiations now
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
so that we are protected and we get what
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
um in fighting the Iowa and the
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
Kansas's so anyway and to that point uh
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
when we combine our 11 states and speak
 
01:58:47.689 --> 01:58:47.699 align:start position:0%
as a voice we've got 20 percent of
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
Congress so it it is in fact a voice uh
 
01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
that that can compete with The
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
there are important things coming up of
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
course in the farm bill number one the
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
nutrition title all of the SNAP benefits
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
the school lunches everything like that
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's huge and those are being negotiated
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
now so we need to watch out for our
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
citizens as far as what is included
 
01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
there commodities
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
actually the um
 
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
specialty crops are included in that it
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
never was before so we have a voice
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
there for our small farmers who are
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
doing vegetables and fruits and things
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
like that instead of competing with the
 
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
soybeans and the corn
 
01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.729 align:start position:0%
soybeans and the corn
um

01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.729 --> 01:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
I I think the other thing that we really
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
should mention is
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
among things that we do Tara mentioned
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we'll do research for you and that
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
type of thing uh lobbying for the farm
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill in fact one year Tara and I took a
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
resolution from our committee and went
 
02:00:07.609 --> 02:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
to a congressional hearing on the farm
 
02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
bill and we we actually spoke to
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
Congress on that one and
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
left them with our resolution so there
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
is a voice but the the main thing I
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
think we do is and I think we do it
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
pretty well is we put on uh an annual
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
meeting in which our committee generally
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
tackles three topics at each one of our
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
annual meetings as well as taking some
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a tour usually Farms but it
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
could be something else
 
02:00:44.689 --> 02:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh this past year we were here in
 
02:00:44.699 --> 02:00:47.050 align:start position:0%
uh this past year we were here in
Manchester

02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:47.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
we had a great five-day session in
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:53.350 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
um

02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
the next one in August is going to be in
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
Toronto so if you would like to do some
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
international travel you may want to
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
but talking about our annual sorry
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
talking about our annual meeting we
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
always try to come up with topics that
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
our members want to hear about
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can decide
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
what to focus on what speakers to bring
 
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
in what experts to bring on to give us
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
information and make it worthwhile for
 
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:28.139 align:start position:0%
everyone to that end this afternoon
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
you're all going to be receiving an
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
email that has a little survey Link in
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
it it's I think there are like 10
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions or something like that just so
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
that you can choose from a list which
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
topics you think are most important to
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
you so that we can take that into
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're coming up with
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
speakers and the topics so if you
 
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind I'd appreciate that a lot
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
what else and and I think the other
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
thing we'll mention is we also do policy
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%

pleasure to have you back in the house
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to know when you guys are
 
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
each of you took chairmanship at one
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
point and sort of bounced it back
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
between party majority yes
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
um how many bills went through your
 
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
committee at a time I mean we we had 20
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know this when we first started out
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
it was in the 30s we had a lot of bills
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
for Ena and then sometimes it was like
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
12 and 11 and you wonder like are we
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
going to continue being a committee if
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have so few bills but then I see it's
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's cyclical it goes up and down and up
 
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
and down depending on what the issues
 
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.669 align:start position:0%
and down depending on what the issues
are

02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
like I say it's it's it's amazing how
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
the same bills keep coming back over and
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
over and over again like landfills but
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's what keeps it interesting do you
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a sense of what a majority of bills
 
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
were I mean were you dealing more with
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
say cat and dog bills than you were with
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that was also that was also a
 
02:05:43.129 --> 02:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
signature one of the big ones that we
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
had in our committee in our tenure was
 
02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
GMOs GMOs that was huge that was huge
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
and painful because that was very
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
divisive and normally like before it you
 
02:05:59.930 --> 02:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
know in the execs that we just heard
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
um it tends to be unanimous we had most
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
of our bills on the consent calendar
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
um because normally AG is not a partisan
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
issue thank heavens unlike other
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
committees where that's all they deal
 
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
with so yeah so Bob is a Republican and
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
I'm a democrat in case you didn't know
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
this and so back in the days every of
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
every year every election the majority
 
02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
would switch and so we would just switch
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairs you know yeah
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
but we still worked again
 
02:06:36.729 --> 02:06:36.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
like a married couple huh
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
he says the same amount yeah I don't uh
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
Tara mentioned uh the GMO bill uh that
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
got really national attention when it
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
was uh here and Tara and I were speaking
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the floor in opposition to the bill
 
02:07:01.729 --> 02:07:01.739 align:start position:0%
both of us were uh and and it was a
 
02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
partisan bill that Tara and I were in
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
agreement and we spoke in opposition to
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
it and we found out later that there
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
were people in Maine at the Farm Bureau
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh that were cheering us on from their
 
02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:22.130 align:start position:0%
offices up in Augusta because they had
 
02:07:22.130 --> 02:07:24.169 align:start position:0%
offices up in Augusta because they had
[Music]

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:24.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
Maine Banning GMOs or requiring labeling
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
and in order for Theirs to go through in
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
the bill it said that New Hampshire has
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
to pass this before ours will go through
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
it had to be you know the neighboring
 
02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
state and so because we didn't pass
 
02:07:44.930 --> 02:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
hours theirs were was not in effect
 
02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:45.950 align:start position:0%
hours theirs were was not in effect
either

02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
which left Vermont pretty much out there
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
on its own at the time that was a tough
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
one and then we also had animal cruelty
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
bills oh my gosh oh my gosh
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
that was the animal activist that would
 
02:08:01.850 --> 02:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
come and testify and cry and you know I
 
02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:02.810 align:start position:0%
come and testify and cry and you know I
mean

02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
it was just really bad so including
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
coming from Nebraska oh yeah they came
 
02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:12.020 align:start position:0%
all the way from Nebraska to testify
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
they were huge I mean people lined out
 
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
in the hallway waiting to testify big
 
02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:18.830 align:start position:0%
in the hallway waiting to testify big
big

02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
big
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
um those were the main ones most of the
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
time it is Small Things
 
02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
um but important to agriculture into the
 
02:08:28.490 --> 02:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
area which is great
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
anything else does anybody have any
 
02:08:36.649 --> 02:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
questions for our guests
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%

know I know the trouble is for our tour
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know our field trip it takes about
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
two hours to get outside of Toronto
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
because it's such a big city and traffic
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
is so bad so I think we're going to wind
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
up going to the huge huge huge farmers
 
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
market downtown Toronto which will be
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
fun I know right they'll be good looking
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
