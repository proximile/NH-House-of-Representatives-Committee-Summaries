yes Senator Pearl thank you for coming
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
in this morning just looking at the map
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
here and it looks like rador radb Street
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
I guess it is and Smith Road that
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
intersection is kind of in an obscure
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
angle is there is there any concern that
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
down the road the the state may have an
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
interest in fixing that corner a bit I'm
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
just curious you know with selling the
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
property what kind of lose that option
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
to do so what I can say is is that when
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
this request came in it was run through
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of Highway design and also
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
our local um uh District 5 uh
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance District um the both the
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
engineers weighed in from those two
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
bureaus and they didn't have any
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with the disposal of property
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you which is our typical practice
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
great thank you further
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%

dated March 20th 202 for if you would
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman uh the limited
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
access right of way was created uh was
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
laid out in um with the layout of New
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Route 111 through by the
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Danville Kingston project in
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
1968 uh upon completion so just just a
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
little background for the committee when
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the department goes through and conducts
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
a project involving limited access right
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
of way when they go through an acire all
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
the property rights one of the property
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
rights the uh property owner is
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
compensated for is the right of access
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
so they no longer have any access rights
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
to the new road which in this case was
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
111 um so in in this point in this case
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh this project had been going on for
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
probably or it's kind of been in the
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
works with the town also involved for
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
approximate well probably more than 15
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
years there was a um there was some
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
interest in doing it uh like around 2010
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
2011 but the developer lost funding at
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
that point they were working with the
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
town um and uh again just more recently
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
they have a new developer so the um the
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
project as I just mentioned the Danville
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
Kingston project um involved um the
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
completion New Hampshire Route 11
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
Huntington Hill Road and then bisected
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
Huntington Hill Road um and created Fry
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
Road to the south of Route 111 however
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
there was no access so there was no it's
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
not like there was an intersection
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
of Fry Road and New Hampshire Route 11
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
there will be an access point so that's
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
basically what they're creating Now by
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
doing this project and this will a
 
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
doing this project and this will a
actually

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
allow uh development to one of the abing
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
partials okay if if I could so
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
um if I understood and correct me if I'm
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
wrong so this property originally uh was
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
part of a limited access Highway the
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
rights were were paid for by the state
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
in essence to remove access compensate
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
them for not having more than whatever
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
access point uh time the calendar moves
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
forward and now they need access onto
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the limited on is it still limited
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
access Highway where we're going on to
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
it correct as it stands today it is uh
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
Route 111 through that area is a limited
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
access right away if we are to if we
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
grant them this break in that limited
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
access this will allow the development
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
of an intersection at that point which
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
will allow further development of an
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
abutting par and I and I fully
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
understand it's somewhat unusual but I I
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
agree with the premise so if if this is
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to and the purchase price with
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the appraisal is agreed to then do then
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
will grant access onto that section of
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
road that is correct all right thank you
 
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
road that is correct all right thank you

Waterfront
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
access um they qualify on the basis of
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
that subdivision and development was
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
commenced at least 20 years ago I have a
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
time frame of between 2001 and 2004 in
 
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.190 align:start position:0%
time frame of between 2001 and 2004 in
my

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
notes uh this um is advantageous to us
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
because multiple houses qualify and
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to restrict them to one
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Crossing which minimizes the safety uh
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
concerns we have with any
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
Crossings all right yes rep excuse me
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl I tried to bring you back
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the house there for a moment some
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
days I wouldn't mind that please
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
continue so this is a one-year lease yes
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh the statute uh requires us to update
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
the uh annual fee every five years and
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is at the end of that five-year
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
period so we uh feel it's best to go
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
with a one-year lease and negotiate a uh
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
well actually calculate the new uh rate
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
based on the Consumer Price Index so uh
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be back with these people with a
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
new lease with a better with a higher
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
price with the because the CPI is not
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
looking like it's going down anytime
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
