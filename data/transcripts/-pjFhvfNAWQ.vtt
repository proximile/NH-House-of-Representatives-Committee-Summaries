00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering uh so
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
remember discussion
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
previously um
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and discussion previously there's some
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
concern over
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.470 align:start position:0%
some of the
wording

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill whether the language was
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
accurate or not um could someone remind
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
me or clarify for me whether
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
we managed to clear that up with the
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment we just passed or not
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
i would say no
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
that the that the amendment improves the
 
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
that the that the amendment improves the
bill

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.829 align:start position:0%
bill
but

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think there are still questions about
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to this bill i think
 
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.069 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to this bill i think
that

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely to have
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
a powerful effect on the production of
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
workforce housing simply because
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's an opt-in bill
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
under the innovative land use controls
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and historically we've seen that those
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
very rarely get used
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
and when they
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
very little effect on the actual
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase in workforce housing thank you
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative and is there further
 
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.269 align:start position:0%
representative and is there further
discussion

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
yes president mesuri thank you mr chair
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll recall that even the sponsor
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
said that the bill when first introduced
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
was somewhat vague and possibly
 
00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:36.230 align:start position:0%
was somewhat vague and possibly
toothless

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
toothless
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
um that was the quote that he used on
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
this and that the amendment
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
might improve it which i think i think
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
we can agree at least
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
to some degree improves it a little bit
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
but not to the point
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh as my friend just said uh to the
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
point where um it does a whole lot
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
or does he intended it gets the intended
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
result thank you
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
i

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
i want to echo what my colleagues have
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
said so far you know it's a step in the
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
right direction but very
 
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.550 align:start position:0%
right direction but very
vague

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
vague
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
and not imp you know
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
it's not going to solve the crisis we
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
have with the workforce housing
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know even though the amendment was a
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
trying to improve it so
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
it will not
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
work in my community or it wouldn't help
 
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
work in my community or it wouldn't help
so

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
as representative band said this is
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
a enabling
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh in that
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
the the towns have to have to adopted
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
innovative land use but uh
 
00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
innovative land use but uh
uh

uh
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
i feel that uh
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
the vagueness of this
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of towns
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
because it's uh it can be taken since it
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
can be taken almost anyway
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh it could probably be taken in a way
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's not intended so i uh i will
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
this is a uh
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
interesting bill it's uh i'm sure you've
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
probably heard that this said before
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
that it's a solution in search of a
 
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
that it's a solution in search of a
problem

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
problem
um

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
i find it be very complicated
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the change to the bill is uh
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
let's see one two three four five six
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
six lines of a single run-on sentence
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh hard to understand
 
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
it's uh hard to understand
uh

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
i can't support the bill i will support
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the ital
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and let me say that
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the election
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
with an election of school boards and
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
budget committees i think we have to be
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
very careful
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
when we as legislators are looking to
 
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.590 align:start position:0%
when we as legislators are looking to
put

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
rules in around uh elected members that
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
could cause them to to fall out of
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
office i think we have to be very
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
careful of that
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
not to say this this would happen in
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
this case but just as a general comment
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
so uh we have a motion on the floor
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
itl and it's been seconded
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see any further discussion so at
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
this point we'll take a roll
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%

during the outbreak of covid

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
made some very creative uses
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
of streets and extended sidewalks
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
out into the street
 
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
out into the street
particularly

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.669 align:start position:0%
particularly
the

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
city of nashua
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
adding to the seating capacity
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that was restricted by covid
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
as i read this bill i think that
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
it would
hinder

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
hinder
 
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.710 align:start position:0%
hinder
municipalities

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
from doing that
 
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
from doing that
so

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know that the municipalities were
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
very creative
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that it worked out great and
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't want to change that
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion mr chair
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
um nashua did very creatively
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
extend the pleasure of having sidewalks
 
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
extend the pleasure of having sidewalks
open

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
streets narrowed and make it
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
dining outside and safely
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
under the pandemic so i think that gave
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
the local control of what's best for the
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
community and this businesses
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
community coming together so i totally
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i'm going to vote
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
against the otp on here the language
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
that was struck
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill that we are considering
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
which is which is the bill itself
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
strikes for the well-being and includes
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
for clear and present danger if the
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
argument is that
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
well-being is ambiguous
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
then i cannot see how clear and present
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
danger is
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
provides any more clarity whatsoever
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
we understand that uh
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
we understand that it is it is critical
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
for city councils to be able
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to respond
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
to instances that happen in their
 
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.549 align:start position:0%
to instances that happen in their
community

00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that uh in a way that
 
00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that uh in a way that
is

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
responsible reactive and timely uh i
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
think what this bill does is strips them
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
of that responsibility or
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
strips them
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
of that ability and puts
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think will ultimately put the
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
residents of that town in clear and
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
present danger so i'll be voting against
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
the otp
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
i will also be voting against the otp i
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
i see this bill as just another attack
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
on local control locally if uh locally
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
elected officials are in the best
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
position to
 
00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
position to
assess

00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
assess
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
the well-being and what they need to do
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure the well-being of their
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
community and this just removes further
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
their ability to respond to their their
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh cities and towns
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for any further discussion he
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
has represented manchapudi thank you mr
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair from my public hearing notes
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.310 align:start position:0%
there was
except

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
the president presenting the bill
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
those who testified all opposed it
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
i really didn't have any one that
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
supported so
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
with that and also
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
taking away the local control is not
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
what we aspire
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i know this is my first term here on
 
00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:44.549 align:start position:0%
and i know this is my first term here on
this

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
committee but
the

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire way of local control is
 
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.470 align:start position:0%
new hampshire way of local control is
as

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
very sacred in that sense so
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
with that i'll vote against otp thank
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
you representative tripp
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
i don't read the bill the same as
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
the others that have spoken against it
 
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
the others that have spoken against it
do

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
but the thing that i
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
most noteworthy about the bill is that
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
it limits
 
00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:15.110 align:start position:0%
it limits
anything

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
that the
the

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
governing body does to 10 days this is
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
something that i think that we learned
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
ten days to flatten the curve you know
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
can usually turn into something else and
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
ten days to uh
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the any ordinance to be in effect
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
is long enough thank you
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative i'm majori
 
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.669 align:start position:0%
yes representative i'm majori
um

00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
we just we just went itl on a bill for
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
allowing uh cities and communities to be
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
able to use their sidewalks as they see
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
best and noted the fact that nashua did
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
an excellent job responding
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
during covid to be able to open up their
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
sidewalks i guess that would have only
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
been good for 10 days according to this
 
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
been good for 10 days according to this
bill

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong yeah i'd like
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
to give an example um i spend summers in
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
moultonborough and the lake where i
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
spend my time up there has been subject
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
to cyanobacteria blooms the last two
 
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.789 align:start position:0%
to cyanobacteria blooms the last two
years

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.710 align:start position:0%
years
and

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes that clear and present danger
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
of entering the water during a toxic
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
bloom may last a lot longer than 10 days
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
des does not have the capability at
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
present to be able to
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
manage those blooms and provide
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
effective notification to the residents
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to rely on local
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
officials to determine whether
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
an advisory on that lake should continue
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
past 10 days so
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's just one example of how this law
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
puts citizens at risk because people
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
that at the state level who who are in a
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
position to help them
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
are not able to
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
and we can't handcuff the local
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
officials from doing their job thank you
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
to begin with reverence and
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
the first comment
 
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.190 align:start position:0%
the first comment
uh

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
placing

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
placing
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
diners on the sidewalks is a clear and
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
present danger so i don't think that
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
that would be applicable to this
 
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
that would be applicable to this
bill

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know whether
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
putting you know chemicals in the water
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
would be applicable either
 
00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.630 align:start position:0%
would be applicable either
uh

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
i would i would think that if there's
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.269 align:start position:0%
something that
is

00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
a health hazard that
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be applicable
 
00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be applicable
but

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i still
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
support the ital
 
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
support the ital
representative

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we have learned anything from the
 
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.549 align:start position:0%
if we have learned anything from the
pandemic

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know which has lasted this is the
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
third year which is luckily we are going
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the right direction
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
ten days of any ordinance is not enough
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to health and
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
safety of the
 
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
safety of the
public

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.509 align:start position:0%
public
so

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know and tying the local
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
um elected bodies with a local authority
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
to not be able to react
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh in a positive way to
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
protect the safety of the community
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
this would hinder that so with that you
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
know like my colleague representative
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
maggiore suggested this goes you know we
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
can't have
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
different opposing
 
00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.630 align:start position:0%
different opposing
bills

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
because the one that gave the local
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
authority to do the sidewalk and then
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
say no you can't do another ordinance
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
which relates to that so this kind of is
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
opposing some of the safety features
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
that the local authorities can have so
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
with that i will oppose otp
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to address representative
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
tripp's comments about blooms
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're not chemicals that are added to
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
the lake there are natural bacteria and
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
they're the oldest living organisms on
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
the face of the earth and they reside in
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
the sediment of a lake or river and
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions like warming
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
which we've been experiencing a trend
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
and increased runoff and sediment
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
disruption they go into a hyper growth
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
mode which is called a bloom
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
and these bacteria release neurotoxins
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
and anatoxins
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
which have led to the deaths of animals
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
the past couple years pets
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's made people very sick
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
des documents all of this
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
last year alone there were 30 lakes that
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
suffered cyan at least one cyanobacteria
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
bloom but des admits
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
that there are many many others they
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
only have one person in charge of that
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
program and she left because she was too
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed they haven't been able to
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
fill that position yet
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's extremely serious
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
researchers at unh and dartmouth and
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
around the world have linked the toxins
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
of these blooms to
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
many neurological diseases
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
some of you may be remember in
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
muscoma lake several years ago there was
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
a cluster of als which they are linking
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
to cyanobacteria blooms in that lake
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire residents don't know
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
that these happen because des is so
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
under resourced to be able to address it
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that just passed
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
unanimously in resources
 
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
unanimously in resources
to

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
require des to come up with a plan to
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
address these but that plan won't be
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
available until late next year
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime we need to rely on
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
local officials to be able to make a
 
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.030 align:start position:0%
local officials to be able to make a
determination

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
um if these blooms require
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
limitations or warnings or some action
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the local community to warn
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
people and restrict them from going into
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
these waters thank you
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion

house bill 1272
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
which limits the authority of town
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%

on house bill 1272 ought to pass
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and this is
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
another one that is
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking away local control and especially
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
tail end of a pandemic
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
to have local officers i mean local
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
health officers not have the ability to
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
react to the community
 
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.710 align:start position:0%
react to the community
is

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
is
really

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
very disturbing
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
i cannot support otp
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
on this one thank you representative
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
matt jory thank you mr chair um
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
hb 79 or i'm sorry health health
 
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.069 align:start position:0%
hb 79 or i'm sorry health health
officers

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
are guided in their responsibility by
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
statute to strip them of this
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility right now and to limit
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
to limit
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
um the adoption of their action to 10
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
days again speaks to
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
speaks to
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know what logic here um
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
in in if this is in response to a
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have certainly seen that
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we have lasted years
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
and not days i think you need to give
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
the local health officers the
 
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.430 align:start position:0%
the local health officers the
responsibility

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh to effectuate uh their their uh their
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
actions or take the act to to to act on
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
their judgment their best judgment
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and do that in a time frame that is
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
responsible within their communities so
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against the otp thank you
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative further discussion on
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
phil us representative tripp
 
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
phil us representative tripp
uh

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think that the ten day limit is uh is
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
a positive in this bill uh not a
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
negative uh
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
i seem to remember that uh
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the governor when uh
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
he he was uh
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
renewing his executive orders every uh
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
30 days or something i don't remember
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
exactly but uh there's nothing in this
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill that uh limits the health officer
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
from renewing uh what they
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
proposed so
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i support the otp
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
not we won't face this but
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
knowing what we went through 10 days
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
was too short even to see the response
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
or re you know
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
to see the effect of the ordinance or
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the health office's
 
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.630 align:start position:0%
the uh the health office's
recommendation

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
recommendation
and

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
ability for the local health officers
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to react and respond
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the health and well-being of the
 
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
to the health and well-being of the
community

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just shaking my head i i just cannot
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
see the logic behind it
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wrong
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
um i know the motion on the floor is otp
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
and there's concern about the 10 days
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
but there was an amendment submitted i
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
was wondering why that wasn't being
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
h

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
it removes the 10 days yeah the
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
amendment's not being considered because
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
it was it wasn't brought up by anybody
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
procedure if if you know of an amendment
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
that you want to see introduced
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
please inform me right away and we'll
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
we'll take the amendment first
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
it really puts us in a bind if we we try
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
to take the amendment last
 
00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:31.589 align:start position:0%
to take the amendment last
so

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i have a question of the
 
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.829 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i have a question of the
procedure

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:38.790 align:start position:0%
procedure
um

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
wondering what is your pleasure of the
 
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
wondering what is your pleasure of the
chair

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
you you know when you ask for a motion
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know if we have
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
another motion that we want to see it
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
jumping before or would you recognize or
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
would you ask for a motion
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know if anybody has a motion because
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
at least for me it seems like
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
you are specifically asking
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
representatives to make a motion so it's
 
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:09.990 align:start position:0%
representatives to make a motion so it's
a

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
it feels to me it's like a predetermined
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify that
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
my perception is
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
not correct or incorrect or correct well
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
as you as you have uh observed that
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
if we take emotion if i take a motion
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
to to itl or to otp if somebody quickly
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
lets me know that there is a motion
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
awaiting to be heard what i'll do is i
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
back off that initial motion
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
allow the amendment to be heard we'll
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment then we'll go back
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the original motion to see how we
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
want to dis disposition the bill based
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
i am uh
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
operating by the by the rules of the uh
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee and and of the house so
 
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
of the committee and and of the house so
um

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong um since it's
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
the original bill that's on the floor
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
say that i'll be voting against the otp
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
my notes from the public hearing show
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
concerns the committee had
 
00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
concerns the committee had
the

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
subjective term of repugnant
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the term any other authority which is
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
very vague with no definition
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
um there were several other things that
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
were wrong in fact the the prime sponsor
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
was so concerned that she's the one that
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
brought the
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment forward so i'll be voting no
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
on otp
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i would thank you mr chair and i
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
would add to that one of one of my
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
concerns is when we look at language
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
that says for the purpose of addressing
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.829 align:start position:0%
that says for the purpose of addressing
locations

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
that present a clear and present danger
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
imagine isolating a certain area
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
of a community that represents a clear
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
and present danger but not the entire
 
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.550 align:start position:0%
and present danger but not the entire
community

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
um i think that some of the amendments
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
that we had in some of the discussions
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
might have cleared that up but i have to
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill for
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons including that one
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
there discussion on the motion
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair this bill
 
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair this bill
would

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
homeowners could ask for an abatement
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
simply because they live
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
near a class five or six road
 
00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.230 align:start position:0%
near a class five or six road
where

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:46:37.839 --> 00:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
there are
ohrvs

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
that use that road
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
the situation where although i can
 
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:50.950 align:start position:0%
the situation where although i can
sympathize

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
sympathize
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
with people that
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
are inconvenienced
 
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.670 align:start position:0%
are inconvenienced
by

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
the use of ohrvs
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
on these class five and six roads
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
i think to allow abatements
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the wrong direction
 
00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the wrong direction
so

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.550 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
i remember during the testimony that
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about uh
 
00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about uh
uh

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
how how this came into being and uh
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
it was it was done somewhat uh
 
00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.630 align:start position:0%
it was it was done somewhat uh
clandescently

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
clandescently
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
and uh it's only after the uh the
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
approval was made that uh
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
the people found out that they would be
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
having uh ohrvs you know going down
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
their road
 
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.349 align:start position:0%
their road
uh

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
i think the issue
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
with uh having
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
atvs or ohrbs on the road is a valid one
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
atvs or ohrbs on the road is a valid one
but

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
requesting abatements is in my mind not
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
the path to take the path to take would
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
be to
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
reverse the approval
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the atvs on a road because they're
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
still going to be dusty it's still going
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
a bad thing
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's noisy
 
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.390 align:start position:0%
that's noisy
and

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
rather than asking for a couple dollars
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
the the correct solution is uh
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
reversing the approval of the use of the
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
the road is a is a ohrv trail
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'll be uh supporting
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
help me catch up my notes here i have
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
to itl from representative loseless was
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
there a second from representative ayer
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay i just didn't have it noted thank
 
00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
okay i just didn't have it noted thank
you

00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion yes
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i'd like to uh
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
it just seemed to be an awful situation
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
in in the testimony that was given
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that the uh given an
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
abatement for a
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
noise problem
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh would uh help
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.030 align:start position:0%
the people who
are

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
having the problem
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
i think there are other avenues to solve
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
either with uh
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a noise uh ordinance
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh i really uh i'm glad it's not in my
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
town because it is an awful situ
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
situation but i have to vote for itl
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
mainly because an abatement would not
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
solve this problem it would just be
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
begging your question
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative rung
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to be voting against the
 
00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to be voting against the
itl

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
as we heard in the testimony from
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
some residents up there it's it's not
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
about the money it's about justice and
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's about the town acknowledging that
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
their property
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
has been negatively impacted by these
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
ohrvs i want to bring your attention to
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
an article that was in friday's edition
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire union leader
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
the headline is judge says state
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
inadequately compensated gorham
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
landowners over atv use i just want to
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
read a paragraph from that a judge has
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
ruled that the town and state
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
inadequately compensated the owners of
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
several residential properties along u.s
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
route 2 when they permitted atvs to
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
operate on and near the road
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
in an order he signed february 15 in
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
grafton county superior court judge
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
lawrence mcloyd said the decision by the
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
transportation the department of natural
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources and the town of
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
gorham to permit use of atvs quote
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
constitutes an unconstitutional taking
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the plaintiff's properties by inverse
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
condemnation pursuant to which each
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiff homeowner is entitled to just
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
compensation as damages end quote
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
so um what i see this is yes i mean
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think the state and the town need to
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
reverse their decision to allow atvs on
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
this on these trails but in the meantime
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
and regardless of that
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
this should
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
constitute good cause it's not giving
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
these landowners an abatement but it's
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
just allowing this to be a reason they
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
can seek an abatement and i think it's
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do so i will vote no
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair if i'm looking at my
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
notes from the public hearing there was
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
a suggestion or one of the
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
testifying they said make this to all
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
public ways
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
prohibiting atvs on all public ways that
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
way it reduces
 
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
way it reduces
the

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
traffic and it limits to its um only the
 
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.750 align:start position:0%
traffic and it limits to its um only the
trails

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
trails
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.510 align:start position:0%
and also
nhma

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
nhma
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
referred to multiple
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know would impact so
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is a issue
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
and it's a one specific community is
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
facing and this
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
is an instance where
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
local control cannot do much
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
it has the state has to respond or we
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
have to respond to the local
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
ordinance i mean not ordinance the tax
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a state thing
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
and it's this is the reverse of what we
 
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.390 align:start position:0%
and it's this is the reverse of what we
usually

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
advocate in this community in this
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
i think itl is just
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
link and so
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
down the road and um
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
i have a hard time uh just ignoring the
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
plea of the
 
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
plea of the
residents

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
of a community in our state and i would
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
oppose itl thank you
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh i have a comment as
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to be last so is there
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments to uh
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
i've seen none
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
i remember the hearing on this and i i
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
remember my thoughts on this
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of passionate discussion
 
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of passionate discussion
about

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
folks that had a lot of noise a lot of
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
dust and
 
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.549 align:start position:0%
dust and
interference

00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
interference
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the good use of their property by
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
the ohrvin
 
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.150 align:start position:0%
the ohrvin
issues

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
the folks that were in favor of this
 
00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:52.630 align:start position:0%
the folks that were in favor of this
were

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
were thinking that the
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
then an abatement would be a
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
proper compensation for that
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
my thought is that while i'm very
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to their problems
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh and understand how abatements are
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
used it's my thought that
 
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.230 align:start position:0%
used it's my thought that
that

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
the folks who have those complaints will
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
not be satisfied with an abatement
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
they'll put a couple hundred dollars in
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
their back pocket
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
however the the noise and the dust and
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
the dirt
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the nuisance doesn't go away
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the real issue
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
so my
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
response during the hearing
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
to some degree was
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think they need to get at the root
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
cause of the problem
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
and solve that
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the need for an abatement will go
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
away or the abatement can be judged on
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
the merits
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
of of the
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the tax law that applies in that
 
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.549 align:start position:0%
of the tax law that applies in that
community

00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think that someone who applies for an
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
abatement and gets the abatement
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
that it's my assumption they will not be
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that and they'll be right
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
back in front of their local government
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
again the following year
 
00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
again the following year
and

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
with the abatement in their hand but
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
they're still going to be upset with how
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
with how the situation was mitigated or
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
not mitigated so with with that thought
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
while very sympathetic to those people
 
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.510 align:start position:0%
while very sympathetic to those people
who

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
had a who have a problem because this is
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
still going to be a problem for a while
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think abatement is the right
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative gilman thank
 
00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:41.589 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative gilman thank
you

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
um i'd also like to point out that there
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
are two bills i believe one was in
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
judiciary and one was in resources
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
that deal with the same thing of class
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
five and six roads and the use of
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles i do not know the
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
disposition of those bills it's not
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
recorded on the house website um but
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
i would like to say uh either those
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
bills should have come to us that's one
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
thing um
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
but that we should wait to see
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
how what those results were
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative manjapuri
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i mean
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
is it uh appropriate to say let's do a
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
um interim study instead of itl at least
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
the topic of discussion will stay on and
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
with some of the
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
sentiments of you know abatement will
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
not solve the issue uh for the residents
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
there is a motion on the floor itl only
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
if that is reversed the next one would
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
be right
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a motion that you're you're
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
projecting you want to make
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking would wouldn't that be
 
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking would wouldn't that be
the

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
way to go when we when we dispose of the
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
current motion that would emotion that
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
motion if the bill is still alive that
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong yeah one point
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make also um to follow up on
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative man djibouti's comment is
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill um
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan bill uh representative
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
renzullo who is chair of the resources
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%

brings it forward with representative
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
gould who's also a long time
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
member of that committee and
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative gottling she's a
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
democrat from
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
from sunapee so i know this has been a
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
huge issue for that committee and
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.390 align:start position:0%
following up on representative
manchapudi's

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%

suggestion if the otp is does fail i
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
would support itl and see if we can
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
bring in people from this other
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
committee to work on it as well because
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
they have dealt with several bills on
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
this issue thank you it's itl on them
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
any further discussion before we uh put
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
it to a vote
 
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.430 align:start position:0%
it to a vote
yes

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes i i agree a little bit with um
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
someone just said that um yes this is
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
can be like a temporary fix but
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
the problem may come back you know
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
someone can get money from the
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
um the issue but uh they they're gonna
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
come back for more and then that's gonna
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
be a local local issue not not for us to
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
one more thing um in the um
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
resources and recreation and development
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me the the bill they had was to
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
go to interrupt interim study for ohrv
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
use in the state
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it was found ought to pass
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
21 to zero
 
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.349 align:start position:0%
21 to zero
and

00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that this would be a good
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
choice because
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
while the state encourages the use of
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
ohrvs as a pleasure vehicle and a
 
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
ohrvs as a pleasure vehicle and a
tourism

aspect
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
we can see from this bill and the
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
other one in
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
judiciary that ohrvs are becoming a
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
problem so maybe we are
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
defeating ourselves in our purpose of
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%

but i believe it
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
the commission the committee report 21-0
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
of an interim or study
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
commission is in order thank you
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
matt giore thank you mr chair two things

one you're going to have to have the
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
last word so prepare to say something
 
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.950 align:start position:0%
last word so prepare to say something
and

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.470 align:start position:0%
and
secondly

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to pile on but noting what
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative gilman has just said and
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
seeing that this did come out 21-0
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
if we could get to an interim study to
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
see how we might be able to help those
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
folks i would be a hundred percent on
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
board with that
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
now you got to say something
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
a very debatable issue uh because
 
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
a very debatable issue uh because
those

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.470 align:start position:0%
those
people

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
some people feel strongly one way or the
 
01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:27.670 align:start position:0%
some people feel strongly one way or the
other

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.710 align:start position:0%
other
and

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
some people also believe that the
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
solution at hand
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
it might be buried and not
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
not so obvious so i'm gonna i'm gonna
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
recommend to
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
those on the committee
 
01:00:44.799 --> 01:00:47.109 align:start position:0%
those on the committee
that

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
although there's a there is a motion to
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
itl this
 
01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:52.390 align:start position:0%
itl this
that

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recommend that we vote down
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
yeah that would that would work
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
i will withdraw my motion to itl the
 
01:01:11.359 --> 01:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
i will withdraw my motion to itl the
bill

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.109 align:start position:0%
bill
representative

01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
what representative would you withdraw
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative lasallus was withdrew his
 
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.549 align:start position:0%
representative lasallus was withdrew his
motion

01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
we don't have a motion on the floor
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative vann
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
um i move that we send this bill
 
01:01:39.559 --> 01:01:41.349 align:start position:0%

1289

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
to interim study
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
for interim study yes representative
 
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.750 align:start position:0%
for interim study yes representative
guthrie

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
guthrie
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
i understand what's going on that
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of sympathy with the
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
situation i think it's the sympathy is
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
well taken however the board is
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is to abate for this serious
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
problem and i think you can talk this
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
to death
 
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:12.309 align:start position:0%
to death
but

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think the solution to the
 
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.750 align:start position:0%
i don't think the solution to the
problem

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
is has anything to do with an abatement
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think the board of selectmen could in
 
01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
i think the board of selectmen could in
fact

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.630 align:start position:0%
fact
recognize

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
the situation and abate for it if they
 
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
the situation and abate for it if they
want

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't even think it's necessary so
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's begging the question to
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
move in this direction and i cannot
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh vote for the
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
current motion
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that i would have hoped
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we stayed with the itl thank you mr
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i i support the interim study
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
um and this i just want to remind the
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee this is not granting
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
abatements it's just acknowledging that
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
this situation exists
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
because it exists and especially after
 
01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:08.069 align:start position:0%
because it exists and especially after
this

01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
this court ruling that it does allow
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
those people to go before their town and
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
ask for an abatement for good cause it
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the abatement is going to
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
be granted but it just is recognizing
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
that this situation exists and i think
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
um studying this more with especially
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%

solution to what they're experiencing
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
and uh of the three
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
no votes who volunteer to write the
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay next is house bill 1293 which is
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the design of sewerage or
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
waste disposal systems for a person's
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair may i make a motion
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
otp on house bill 1293
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second i'd like to
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
second that
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
can i speak to my motion yes please too
 
01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:26.309 align:start position:0%
can i speak to my motion yes please too
uh

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
apparently this bill has been around i
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean that this situation has been around
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
for a while and uh the from the
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
testimony i heard
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a good idea to let uh
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
a home improvement guy design his own
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh there's uh
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a science than an art
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
and uh if it's done improperly even
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the des
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
reviews the uh
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh the plan it could be
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh it could have effects that are
 
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh it could have effects that are
noticed

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
essentially all it does is remove the uh
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
the ability for a homeowner to design
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
his own septic system and this is why i
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill yes representative majorie thank
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um as many of us sit on
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
select boards in our town i have for a
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
long long long time
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
oh speak sophomorically this is a duh
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
moment i'm like this exists you can do
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
that i had no idea so i'm all in favor
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the off the path because i don't
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
think you should be doing this but i
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
feel bad that i didn't even know you
 
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.390 align:start position:0%
feel bad that i didn't even know you
could

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
if i write the report that language
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
would not be in there representative was
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
was your motion to ipl or otp
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative mitch putin thank you
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.069 align:start position:0%
mr chair
um

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
in my notes
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
from the testimony
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
it says oh so you can do your own
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
neurosurgery if you want on yourself
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's alludes to that way of
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
more you know
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
i think octopass is the right motion
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes as i remember the testimony
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
the thing that really struck me was when
 
01:08:38.799 --> 01:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
the thing that really struck me was when
des

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
came in and and
 
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.229 align:start position:0%
came in and and
testified

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
the inordinate amount of time that they
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
have to spend
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
on these self-designed septic systems
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions and follow-up
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
questions and they just spend an awful
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
lot of time
and

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.229 align:start position:0%
and
where

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the case of a professional
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
who designs the septic systems
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
they don't have that sort of issue
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting in support of the
 
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.349 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting in support of the
otp

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative power thank you mr
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
chair um i would like to note that
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
the the ability to design a septic
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
system is different than
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the ability of a homeowner to say do
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
electrical work inside their house or
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
renovate a bathroom or
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know finish off a basement
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
septic to system design
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
is is not trivial
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of knowledge that needs to
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
go into that
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
soil mechanics is part of that
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
and also the technology for
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
the um for the septic
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
systems themselves it's rapidly changing
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
as does other um you know technologies
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
so it's it's i would say it's rare for a
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
person to just to have that that
 
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.430 align:start position:0%
person to just to have that that
knowledge

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so the difference with a homeowner
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing a diy project in their house
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
versus a septic system it can impact
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
the aquifers and wells
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the neighborhood and also the
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
environment and i would also lastly like
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
to point out
 
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.350 align:start position:0%
to point out
that

01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
takes away the
 
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
takes away the
ability

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the homeowner to submit a plan
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
and like the representative los alas
 
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.070 align:start position:0%
and like the representative los alas
said

01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
and if somebody doesn't really have the
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
background or the experience to
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
submit a plan it's it's requiring a lot
 
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.790 align:start position:0%
submit a plan it's it's requiring a lot
of

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
their their resources
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i i support
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
the motion ought to pass thank you
 
01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.950 align:start position:0%
the motion ought to pass thank you
representative

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no further comment
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
my last comment on this is
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
when i think of this bill
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think of a couple first couple things
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
the knee-jerk reaction is well gee
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm the homeowner
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
why can't i design my own
 
01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
why can't i design my own
system

01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
leave me alone
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
however i may not always be the
 
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
however i may not always be the
homeowner

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
i may sell this house
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
to a nice young couple that's deciding
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
to move into my old neighborhood
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
and when they move in
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
they may find that the septic system
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that i designed
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work or doesn't fit
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
the needs that they have
 
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
the needs that they have
so

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would think that we would want the
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
same reason we want the building code to
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
be followed
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent owners need to have some
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
assurance that what was done was done
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
legally and correct so
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
with that input i'll be supporting the
 
01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
with that input i'll be supporting the
utp

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
see no further questions uh mr clerk
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
would you take a role
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh otp on 1293

makes a second as a discussion about
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
this particular bill may i speak to my
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
motion yes please ah
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start out by saying uh i'm
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
not against the uh
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
oops i'm on the wrong page
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board but uh
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
i do think that uh
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.709 align:start position:0%
it's uh
it's

01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
investigatory uh uh rain is
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
a little unlimited the fact is the uh it
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually says that but it's not limited
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think the bill does a good job of
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
clarifying what the housing appeal board
 
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.669 align:start position:0%
clarifying what the housing appeal board
can

01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:33.110 align:start position:0%
can
review

01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
it changes it to uh
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
boards and uh commissions within the
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
rather than just uh
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
any other uh
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
reasons they want to investigate so i i
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
support the otp thank you yes
 
01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
support the otp thank you yes
representative

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to oppose the otp because
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
in fact limiting it to the list that is
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
provided in the in the bill
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
does mean that for example the select
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
board is eliminated
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
and other boards which actually do make
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
decisions having to do with land use are
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated from the housing appeal
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
board's authority and i think that's a
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
mistake because sometimes that's
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessary for example parking
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirements sometimes belong to the
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
select board and that's an issue that
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
comes up often particularly in the case
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
of providing workforce housing
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
how much parking you require affects the
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
cost of that housing and preventing um
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board from looking
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
seems short-sighted
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majori
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i don't i hope i've
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
never been shy about expressing my
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
opinions about the h.a.b and and how the
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
h.a.b came to be
 
01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:01.110 align:start position:0%
h.a.b came to be
um

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to rehash all of those
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote in favor of the ought
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
to pass here because i do think that
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
this seemingly simple change will
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
focus the hab on its responsibilities
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that focus to be on
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of housing um so i myself will
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor of the ought to pass
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i remember
 
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.510 align:start position:0%
if i remember
the

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
the
hearing

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is hab has been in place just very
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
brief uh time 2 3 last term or term
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
before it was passed so
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
two terms ago and they implemented one
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
term ago and so
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for correcting and um
 
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for correcting and um
having

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
seen that this hasn't been in place too
 
01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
long enough to
 
01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.149 align:start position:0%
long enough to
[Music]

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
say it's working or not working but this
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
would narrow or at least clarifies the
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
role of the hab so i would be
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
supporting um
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
in favor of otp so this clarifies and
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
gives an opportunity to see how this
 
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
gives an opportunity to see how this
works

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you there being no oh yes
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative ron
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to vote against the otp
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons one for the one of
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
the reasons representative
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
manjapudi state is it really hasn't been
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
in effect very long so i think we need
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
to have some more experience with them
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
we also had testimony from several
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
people that it would increase court
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
costs and length of time for someone to
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
get an issue adjudicated
 
01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
get an issue adjudicated
so

01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that i know the
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
courts are very backlogged even as it is
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
and adding on to this
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
when we have a housing board i think is
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we also heard testimony from
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
many people about
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
that wanted it i tealed
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
and these are people that are prime
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in our housing situation or

01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%

at different rates
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think that this really
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
complicates the whole
 
01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
complicates the whole
tax

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.870 align:start position:0%

system
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
could have the result of
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh having one class
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
of property
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
against another class of property
 
01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
against another class of property
and

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
am moving ito representative
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
i support the itl motion as well this is
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
one of the most anti-business bills i've
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
seen coming in a long time
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
we rely on a balanced tax base to
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
support our communities
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
and um and it's driven by the value of
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
property yes we do provide exemptions
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
and credits under cert
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances but
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's right for us to take
 
01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:06.149 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's right for us to take
any

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
inhibit businesses from coming to new
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire coming to communities
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
to help support those communities
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it's a slap and a face
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
to businesses so i'll be voting um for
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
the ito any further comments yes
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%

the apartments association of new

hampshire called this a slippery slope
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh looking at my notes again on public
 
01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh looking at my notes again on public
hearing

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.709 align:start position:0%
hearing
bia

01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
bia
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
came out and said
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
opposing because this is not only uh
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
against business uh
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
coming into your communities but it's
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
also pitting uh
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
residents against residential versus uh
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
business so it's it it's more a divisor
 
01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.510 align:start position:0%
business so it's it it's more a divisor
for

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
the community so with that i tell i
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
support the agency representative
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
gallagher did you have a comment
 
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.430 align:start position:0%
gallagher did you have a comment
so

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.189 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
i think the idea behind the bill makes
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
intuitive sense to me um
 
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.550 align:start position:0%
intuitive sense to me um
i

01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.750 align:start position:0%
i
um

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to applaud represent the
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
for being willing to
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
um look at states that
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
have different
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
ideological perspectives from his own
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
for inspiration for legislation and
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
i think the fact
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the bill is being portrayed as
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
anti-business is a good thing
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
i i think some of these businesses need
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be slapped in the face and
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
taxed more
 
01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
taxed more
but

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
i do think that some of the
 
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.149 align:start position:0%
i do think that some of the
implementation

01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
01:26:22.159 --> 01:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
implementation
needs

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
needs work though
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think there were some legitimate
 
01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.629 align:start position:0%
i think there were some legitimate
questions

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
raised about say the tax software
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
needing to be updated the extra
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
complications as we create for dra and
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
etc so
 
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
etc so
um

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
i would urge the sponsor to
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
go study the states where this has been
 
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.790 align:start position:0%
go study the states where this has been
implemented

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
more in depth and
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
more in depth and
then

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
um come back to us with
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%

that
 
01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
that
when

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
when we had the testimony that they go
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
well portsmouth has this problem
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem that anybody else
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
has this problem
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh i spoke with
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
people from uh
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
our departments the building inspector
 
01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.790 align:start position:0%
our departments the building inspector
uh

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
department head and uh
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
i says well
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
you guys don't have a vote right and he
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
says well no we don't make decisions we
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
just provide uh
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and advice
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that's probably the situation
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
in most the towns in new hampshire
 
01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:37.430 align:start position:0%
in most the towns in new hampshire
it

01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
the only place that this
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
is a problem seems to be
 
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
is a problem seems to be
portsmouth

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is a local problem
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
it should be solved locally and this is
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
why i support leaving
 
01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.189 align:start position:0%
why i support leaving
the

01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
membership on
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
local boards
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
especially specifically
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
planning board this the way it is thank
 
01:30:00.639 --> 01:30:01.350 align:start position:0%
planning board this the way it is thank
you

01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion from the
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee on this
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill yes for visitor majority
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cheryl i confessed to being
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
a bit myopic when this when i first saw
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
this bill uh thinking about my friends
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth being just down the road
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
in northampton and knowing what that
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue was and thinking this makes
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
perfect sense but then
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
forgetting uh and i'm i'm i feel bad
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
about the fact that i did forget that
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are so many communities throughout
