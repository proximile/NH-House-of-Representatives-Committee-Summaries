00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody woo
 
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 align:start position:0%
okay we've got good audio this morning
 
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
uh I'm representative Sue Mullen I am
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
the chair of this committee and I am
 
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
officially opening the interim study
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
meeting on House Bill 1229
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is a study on whether or not we
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
need a study as we uh uh
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
affectionately refer to House Bill 1229
 
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
the study of the study bill so uh for
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
those of you who are joining us for the
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
first time this is the third time that
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have met
 
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
we have been dealing with a number of
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
food related School meals related uh
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
bills that came up last session and
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
taking a peek at whether or not we feel
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
that there are aspects to those bills
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
though they were not adopted this past
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
session whether or not there were
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
aspects to the bill that warranted
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
further investigation and ultimately we
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
will make a recommendation on whether or
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
not we think legislation is warranted
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
so prior to today we heard from New
 
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions and I think
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
we may hear from them again today
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
we heard from the Department of
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
Education we heard from the American
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
Heart Association
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
today we are privileged to have our farm
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
to school people with us and without any
 
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
further ado
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to introduce representative
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
Alexis Simpson uh who is going to kick
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mullen it's
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
good to be here with you all again
 
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
um yes so I thought that I would start
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
us off by
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
um reminding people of what was behind
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bill that we proposed on the farm to
 
00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
school reimbursement policy Bill and
 
00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.090 align:start position:0%
school reimbursement policy Bill and
then

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
um open it up to insights and
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
information from the folks behind me who
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
are all stakeholders in this in this
 
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
are all stakeholders in this in this
policy

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
so last winter we brought to you a farm
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
to school reimbursement bill
 
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
um this kind of program as you know
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
would increase healthy local food
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
options available to New Hampshire
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
school children it would help us build
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
supply chain resiliency and support our
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy by increasing the
 
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
amount of food New Hampshire schools
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
purchased from local farms so since last
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
spring we have continued to work with
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to discuss the best ways to
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
move forward with this idea we've also
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
gathered more information from around
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
the country about what makes a good
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
program work and to identify solutions
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
to some of the challenges that we have
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
seen some of which came up in our
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
conversation with this committee
 
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
conversation with this committee
previously

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
we have a strong Farm to school uh
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
program in some districts in this stage
 
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
with state which is good news but we
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
want all children to have access to
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
Healthy nutrition nutritious local food
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
and some of the experts and Advocates
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
here from the Child Nutrition community
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders will talk more
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
about the importance of Child Nutrition
 
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
and how this bill fits into that they'll
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
be able to answer technical questions
 
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
that you have about this Farm to school
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
program about Child Nutrition and about
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
the local food system
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
so we're looking forward to hearing some
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
of your questions or all of your
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
questions and incorporating
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
um that feedback but we also want to say
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
that we've spoken in some detail with
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
folks from the Department of Education
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Agriculture and
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
already see some areas where we could
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
simplify what we've been working on
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is great news and we'll keep those
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
conversations moving forward as well
 
00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:25.610 align:start position:0%
conversations moving forward as well
um

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have already taken I don't do would
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
you like me to talk about some of those
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
things those specifics great
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
um so we've already taken under
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
advisement the feedback uh from the
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um agriculture that the tiered system
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
might be difficult to administer
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
especially at the beginning of this uh
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.009 align:start position:0%
of this
um

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
of instituting this policy so I don't
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
know if you remember speaking of details
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
I know how many bills you all saw and
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for that work but I'm not
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to remember those
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
details let me real quickly say we had
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
talked about a tiered system of
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
reimbursement where we would
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement a New Hampshire farms at a
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
higher level than we would reimburse
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
Farms outside of New Hampshire that were
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
providing local food
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I do want to say that there's been
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
years worth of collaboration among our
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
states in the region to develop Regional
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
Food Systems and to approach food
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
security and resiliency from a regional
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
perspective because in New Hampshire we
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
don't produce a big percentage of our
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
own products this is the reason we
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
thought of that tiered system in the
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
first place however we see the wisdom in
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
sourcing all products for the farm to
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
school reimbursement program from New
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms Fishers and producers so
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see if we can make that
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
work and we also hope that this will
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
dovetail with the Department of
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
agriculture's work to build up and
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
strengthen our New Hampshire Food
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
Systems infrastructure
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
are um it's important to note here that
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
our at the beginning of the school year
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
our food service directors are still
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
facing some supply chain issues so that
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
problem has not completely gone away
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
um there was another piece of the bill
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
about how the reimbursements would take
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
place and so we've begun the
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Department of
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
Education about how we could make that
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
easiest for them
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
um and ha and do it in a way that fits
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
with the way they already reimburse for
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
School meals
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
um in a continuous process instead of
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
having a specific date every month that
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
receipts are due so I you know I don't
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
know how those details would shape out
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
exactly but just to know we're working
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
um for what will be easiest for the
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to make this
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
program work should the legislature
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
decide that this policy
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um is a good one and should you all
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
decide that this policy is a good one
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
um so I I want to remind you of one
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
other piece of this bill which is that
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
much of our school nutrition money comes
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
from the federal government but only a
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
fraction of each dollar goes to
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
purchasing food itself
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
um there are labor costs and Equipment
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
costs and infrastructure costs that are
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
also part of that
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
um small amount of money that is paid
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
for School meals every day
 
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
um so as the bill was written last year
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the money for the program
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
would be Federal and the third would be
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
from the state's general fund we believe
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is a worthwhile investment for the
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
state you'll hear testimony later about
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
Child Nutrition but I want to highlight
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
at the outset that a study from the
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
Rockefeller Institute tells us that for
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
every dollar spent on school nutrition
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
there's a two dollar return on that
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
investment not only do our children
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
benefit but this is a fiscally
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
responsible investment for the people of
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
so in closing this reimbursement program
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
would help strengthen New Hampshire's
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
agriculture sector and Regional food
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
security it will also help New Hampshire
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
students understand the regional
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
agricultural Geographic social and
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
cultural aspects of our food system in
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and now I'm eager to well
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm eager to introduce everyone else but
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
also if you have questions specifically
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
this is probably a good time to do that
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
as well thank you representative
 
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.650 align:start position:0%
as well thank you representative
woodcock

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
all right it's been a while it's been a
 
00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.030 align:start position:0%
all right it's been a while it's been a
while

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
come on how are you good morning I just
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
want to be sure I was clear when you
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
were speaking about the reduction or
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
your presumed reduction in the tiered
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
system that I understand you to say that
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
out of state the non-new Hampshire folks
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
would be basically eliminated to be in
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only prices I want to say
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we're considering we have
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
not Fallen um down on that yet because
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of stakeholders in this
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
process across the state and they have a
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
very good sense of what products and how
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
much of each product we can produce in
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
order to meet the needs of the program
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
and so we don't want to
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to hamstring ourselves
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
from this from the get-go so we want to
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
analyze that information first before we
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
commit to only New Hampshire thank you
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison thank you madam
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for your statement being
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
here I want to just go back to ready at
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
the end of your statement you talked
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
about a cost sharing of two-thirds
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
Federal one-third State yes could you
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
tell me for my edification what exactly
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
that is and how much is one-third of the
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
cost of that which would be the state
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
share sure so the um
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
the goal at the beginning of this and
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's a um as I said where
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks have been working on this
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
for a while like how do we increase our
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
resiliency in New Hampshire right and so
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
the goal was how do we get ourselves to
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
have 10 of the food that we buy for
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
schools to remain in the New Hampshire
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
economy and we know that when we spend
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
the local dollar it um a very high
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
percentage stays in our local economy
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
and so not to be sending all of our
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
money across the country
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and and some of that money that we
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
get to buy food well a lot of it it
 
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
comes from the federal government and so
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
we are trying to redirect 1.2 million uh
 
00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:26.750 align:start position:0%
we are trying to redirect 1.2 million uh
dollars

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
from the federal money that we get for
 
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.949 align:start position:0%
from the federal money that we get for
um

00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
the cash per meal reimbursements okay to
 
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.170 align:start position:0%
the cash per meal reimbursements okay to
local

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
farms and where does the one-third share
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
say come in so that is in order to get
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
us to ten percent we would be asking uh
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
another 600 000 from the general funds
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
all right representative Simpson if you
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
want to introduce who you've brought
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
with you that would great definitely so
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Megan Murray is on the
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
and she's been working hard on this bill
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
as well from that perspective so she has
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of things to share with you and
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
then um Stacy purslow is behind me from
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
the farm to school program and she's
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
been doing a lot of um a deep study of
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
what's going on in other states so she's
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
bringing some of that new information to
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
us as well and then we have um one or
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
two folks from the New Hampshire hunger
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
Solutions who have been working hard on
 
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
this bill in program as well
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's all for today
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much yes uh
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murray would you like to
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh join
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
or replace representative Simpson at the
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
Mike certainly join not replace
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having me before the
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is uh for the record
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
Megan Murray I am the deputy ranking
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
member in environment and Agriculture
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
and what you have before me uh before
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
yourselves is a map of the New Hampshire
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
farm products map
 
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
and so this is just a general idea of
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
what Farms exist within the state of New
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what's out there and they are
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is a website that has been put
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
together by the University of New
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Cooperative Extension
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the left hand side of
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
it as you're going down it breaks them
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
into categories and we recognize that
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
not all of these categories are
 
00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:33.139 align:start position:0%
available as Farms to be
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
purchased through schools for example
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
some homesteads may not qualify for
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
purchase through the school program for
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
certain reasons
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
um with that said
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
um we we truly feel that there is a
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
network within our farm system Community
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
whether it's a CSA a CSF it's local
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
farms it's wholesalers that have the
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get food into the hands
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
of kids locally sourced and when we're
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking about nutritional content that
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
has a relevance to the daily lives of
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
where kids are in in their communities
 
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:08.540 align:start position:0%
as a parent and as a an educator myself
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's a wonderful talking point
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
to have with kids at either the lunch
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
table or in the classroom or at home and
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
saying hey what did you get to try today
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and so with that we are really
 
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
intentionally working on
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
creating a network within the farm to
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
school network that Partnerships with
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
what's already there in the agricultural
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
community that is easier for our school
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition folks to tap into so
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
with that I'll happily try and answer
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
any questions but I know that there's
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what's up thank you man are
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
you forgotten house yes
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
um Megan the
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
percentage of currently I know that some
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
of the local farms now participate on in
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
their own local programs with the local
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
school systems you know a guesstimation
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
about what that is
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
a fairly good question I I don't I I'm
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
happy to get that data for you but I do
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
um representative Simpson may have that
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
information but I will say that in my
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
own Community School System when there's
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to purchase apples they
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
do okay um I do know that uh I had a
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
conversation with the folks at our
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
school Services uh food service and
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
nutrition as well and they are eager to
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
participate in a program
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
um like this because they truly do
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
believe that for example we had a notice
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
that it was due to some supply chain
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues they weren't able to Source uh
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
SunButter just recently so I do think
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
that there are there are true needs to
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
sort of diversifying what we're talking
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
about when we're talking about
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
large-scale food supplies and then we
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
have our our smaller more Regional Food
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
Supplies that really are crucial to the
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
work that we're trying to do here thank
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
can I can I add real quick absolutely
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
um that reminds me of something which is
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that the
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will be sure to
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
need in doing this program should it
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
come about is
 
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.370 align:start position:0%
come about is
um

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
some technology as well as as staff and
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're you know it's and when we're
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
looking at other states it's it's not um
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
clear exactly how much staff they would
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.190 align:start position:0%
clear exactly how much staff they would
need

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
um part-time to full-time person and not
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
clear yet but
 
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
clear yet but
um

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
the technology is definitely clear and
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
some of that technology would help us
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
have some data that we just don't have
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
any way to collect at this point so we
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
don't really have a thorough sense of
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
that although I'm sure Stacy has some
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know how much of the
 
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.930 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know how much of the
year

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
um our local produce will be able to
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
continue supplying food
 
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.810 align:start position:0%
continue supplying food
sure

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and so obviously
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
we uh know that in New Hampshire we do
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
not have year-round farming available to
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
us we do know that we have other methods
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
of farming that extend our Seasons
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
whether it's using uh
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
um hoops and hoop houses to do that
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
extension or if it's indoor aquaponics
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
or Agriculture and there are some other
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
things that are there and in recognizing
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
that we do understand that there is not
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent a year-round Source
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
but there are also
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
um that is why we recognize that there
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
would be a unique mixture between those
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you manager I thank you for taking
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
capability of the state to provide
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
storage and distribution of products now
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
my experience is not so much in growing
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
crops in the ground so much as dairy
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
farming by being Dairy farming
 
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:20.660 align:start position:0%
requires immediate cooling storage
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
hauling them large containers down to a
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
Dairy which meets the processing that
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
day and those kinds of imperatives if
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
you will of that product and I'm sure
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
there are others for apples and whatever
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
I just have never raised apples
 
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.970 align:start position:0%
I just have never raised apples
um

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:39.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
what what is your role in that process
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
is that something that's that's pushed
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
off on the
 
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
off on the
um

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
so-called delivery system in other words
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
stores and whatever I just I just wonder
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
about preserving the product until it's
 
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.010 align:start position:0%
about preserving the product until it's
consumed

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
this was something that the Food Service
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
folks and and I had discussed as well
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
and we have all recognized that there's
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous growth in Refrigerated
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
trucking capabilities
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
um in the delivery services even right
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
down to the local csas and csfs that can
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
arrive directly to your doorstep So to
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
that end much of that infrastructure is
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
in place already to get the product from
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
the farmer to the school system or to a
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just have that there are
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that um the Commissioner of
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and others in his Department
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
are working with to increase our ability
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
across the board across the state to
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of storage we have
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
because we for a lot of crops whether
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
cold crop squashes or apples or things
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
like that um we we could definitely use
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
more storage
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
um in every sector not just for the
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
school nutrition sector so that is
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
definitely a challenge that the
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture is looking at
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like has some real
 
00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.490 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like has some real
possibilities

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
um for joint work going forward with the
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
folks that they're collaborating with
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and and some federal money as well
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
um but uh we see this as really part of
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
part of the whole food system in the
 
00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:26.179 align:start position:0%
state just also both needing the storage
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
and increasing the um
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
the sector entirely like increasing the
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
um demand in the agriculture sector
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
which helps
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
does that is that answer
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
I was curious about the school end of
 
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
I was curious about the school end of
this

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
um currently since a lot of the stuff is
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
fairly prepared when they get it the the
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
time and effort to Preparing lunches is
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
not as great and so the question is when
 
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:12.020 align:start position:0%
we're delivering fresh produce
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
are the school
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
are the school Cooks if you will set up
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you have certainly noted a truth
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
across the state which is that every
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
school kitchen is different and has
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
different capabilities and some have
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
great greater kitchens greater counter
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
space greater not you know better knives
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
than other schools have and so right now
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
those challenges are are largely met
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
yeah in different ways as well and I
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
assume that the same would happen with
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
the farm to school program and sometimes
 
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.140 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
doing the processing of the let's call
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
it a fruit or vegetable doing the
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
processing of the fruit or vegetable at
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um at a school that has greater capacity
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
to do that and maybe the equipment to do
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
that and then moving it to schools that
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
have smaller kitchens or you know no
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
storage space or something like that so
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
in the immediate future I think it would
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
be those kinds of fixes that are used
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
and then in the long-term few future
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
tried to equip each school to do kind of
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you ladies
 
00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:38.390 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you ladies
um

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
in your discussions with the community
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
or the state at large do you have any
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
how many school districts are currently
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
purchase their products
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
that is a great question and I'm
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
wondering representative Mullen if this
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
might be the time to ask Stacy purslow
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
from the farm to school program to come
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
forward she'll have much better
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
understanding of that than we can see it
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
in my eyes I could tell all right great
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
Stacy if you wouldn't mind pushing that
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.409 align:start position:0%
one okay
um

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
I took some notes on some of the
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
questions that were already asked and
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
want to provide some more information
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
there as well as answer your question
 
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.010 align:start position:0%
there as well as answer your question
um

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
so the seasonality of food in New
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is year round obviously
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
tomatoes are on their way out but uh
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
storage crops are coming in Winter
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
squashes carrots potatoes that can be
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
procured most of the Year proteins can
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
be procured mostly year-round
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
value-added dairy products are there
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
year round so there's plenty of options
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
for local food that schools can buy
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
year-round even though some things
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
certainly have a shorter season
 
00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
certainly have a shorter season
um

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
and as Alexis said uh the department of
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
AG is working to potentially get some
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that would help support some
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure issues that you
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
had questions about of storage and
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
had questions about of storage and
transportation

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.010 align:start position:0%
transportation
um

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to mention we also have a
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
lot of Hydroponics happening in the
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
state so in the Louden facility there's
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
a new facility that's going in up in
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
Berlin that's going to be doing lettuce
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
as well so there's going to be
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
year-round availability through new
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
hydroponic Growers
 
00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:46.490 align:start position:0%
hydroponic Growers
um

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
and we also have a food Hub Network so
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
food Hub is a local business that
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
Aggregates and distributes local food
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
um so which is something that hasn't
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
always been here so they they have a web
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
presence you can order online you can
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
see what the Farms have so this would be
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
the vehicle of how schools can order
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
food through the various food hubs Three
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
River Farmers Alliance food connects
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
Fresh Start Farms Kearsarge food Hub
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
they all Aggregate and most of them do
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
distribution as well in in certain
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
regions of the state so that would be
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of the main vehicles of how schools
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh can and would be purchasing local
 
00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:34.909 align:start position:0%
uh can and would be purchasing local
food

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
um as your question that's how many
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
schools participate in farm to school
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing that's a tough one
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
um the USDA does a USDA Farm to school
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
census every couple of years
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the last census that was done
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
um they we didn't have a lot of
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
participation from the school so it's
 
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.140 align:start position:0%
voluntary to you know answer a survey
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have a lot of
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
participation this past census
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
so there's really not good data there
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
and with covid it was you know just been
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
a couple of very unusual school years
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
for school Food Service
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so personally for the farm to school
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
program would hope to get back to doing
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
my own census this school year to get a
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
better sense of what what schools are
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
doing because we have done it in the
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
past and
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
um schools by apples it's their number
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
one food local food that they buy along
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
with carrots and potatoes and lettuce
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
and squashes so
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
um over the years schools have been
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing local purchasing some may only get
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
local apples but some are doing quite a
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
bit as much as they can
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
so it's it's and some are doing nothing
 
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:48.350 align:start position:0%
so it's it's and some are doing nothing
so

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a real range of of
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
activities that the schools are engaged
 
00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:57.889 align:start position:0%
activities that the schools are engaged
in

00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for you Stacy um
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
who who does it well
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
is it Maine is it Vermont is it Idaho is
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh is there a state out there that is
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
sort of pioneering this or uh pioneered
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
it 20 years ago when we just are
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
catching up
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
yeah 20 years ago it really wasn't a
 
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.330 align:start position:0%
yeah 20 years ago it really wasn't a
thing

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.110 align:start position:0%
thing
um

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
Farm to school as a national thing came
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
into being in around 2004 and that's
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
when the New Hampshire Farm to school
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
program started
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
um and it was New Hampshire Farm to
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
school started with a grant and there
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
was a some efforts on the Seacoast to
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
get local food into schools and worked
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
with one farmer one conventional
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
distributor and a handful of schools on
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast to move to you know move
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
local food in that way
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge because the school
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
lunch program is the same across the
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
country on how it functions
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of requirements and
 
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.789 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of requirements and
guidelines

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.889 align:start position:0%
guidelines
of

00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
how you have to go about purchasing food
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
and nutrition requirements related to
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
school meal programs and the amount of
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
funding that's available to support
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
Foods food purchasing so
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are good examples across the
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
country there's I didn't say there's any
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
one state that's doing it better I think
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
some states have more infrastructure for
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
Farm to school than other states so like
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
Vermont has
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
their organic farming Association has a
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
farm to school position their Department
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture has a farm to school
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
position they have several non-profit
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
organizations dedicated to farm to
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
school so there's more resources and
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in Vermont to do the kind
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
of work and of course Vermont has a lot
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
more farms in New Hampshire
 
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.090 align:start position:0%
more farms in New Hampshire
um

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
so they do a pretty good job there
 
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
so they do a pretty good job there
um

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
but we do have some pockets of good food
 
00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.870 align:start position:0%
but we do have some pockets of good food
purchasing

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
purchasing
um

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
I know last earlier this year we heard
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
some testimony from the Exeter school
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
district and they've been engaged in
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
farm to school for many years
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
I work closely with the oyster School
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
District because I'm based at UNH and
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
they're right there and
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
um they were given through a warrant
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
article extra money every year to just
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
to buy local food for their School meals
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
program because they know the value that
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
it it is for the kids and for the
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
agricultural community over there so
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's sort of an exception
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
that the community decided to give the
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
school Food Service money just to buy
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
local food so that's kind of what we
 
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:55.340 align:start position:0%
hope this bill would do
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
incentivize schools so they can get
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
local fresh
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
more nutritious food support the local
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
agricultural economy and support the
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
farms in their Community if they can
 
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.850 align:start position:0%
farms in their Community if they can
um

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:18.769 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think you're off the hook okay thank
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.810 align:start position:0%
I think you're off the hook okay thank
you

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson can I ask you uh
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
a question a follow-up question so when
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
you talked about the technology that
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be necessary for uh getting this
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
program up and running yeah uh that
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
technology would be necessary where at
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
each school and the Department of
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
Education or just at the Department of
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
Education just at the department of Ed
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you yeah
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
all right am I correct that we have New
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions people who
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
not necessary if you have questions how
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
about if you have questions for them I
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
think you're covering the hunger and the
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
school of nutrition issues broadly yeah
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know in all of these hearings so
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
maybe if you have specific questions
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
um for them they would answer them okay
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
great could we have you uh come up and I
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
will ask my compatriots here whether or
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
not they have questions for
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions my
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
question is um
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:52.820 align:start position:0%
system-wide if you will I hear a lot of
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about we're interested in
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
this aspect of it or that aspect hunger
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
and so forth when I talked and surveyed
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
the people working in the schools in my
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
region they basically said we follow the
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we're given and the
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
requirements on this for providing
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it is for food in the schools
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
and did not have any record or
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
much incident apparently of complaints
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
about their following the prescribed
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
meal preparation kinds of things so I'm
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
wondering what from your perspective is
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
different maybe than they would see it
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
and are we looking at just sort of where
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
they can get their food and how you can
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
prepare it or who has Refrigeration for
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
storing it in preparation etc etc all
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
the concomitant expenses of food
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
preparation that aren't specifically
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
preparation but
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to make sure that I'm
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
understanding your question correctly
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
that you're just wondering like what is
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
the increased nutritional value of local
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
food versus following the the guidelines
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
and ordering from
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
large distribution companies
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
I wasn't specifically questioning the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
the that part of it it's really just a
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
question of
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
how much more Refrigeration do we need
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
how much more storage when I was a child
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
we were on a
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
pretty hard Scrabble Farm but we stored
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
all the potatoes on the ground under the
 
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.950 align:start position:0%
all the potatoes on the ground under the
house

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
so when you wanted potatoes one of the
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
kids got sent under the house to get
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
potatoes so that can't be happening at a
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
school I realized and you have
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
electricity we didn't and you know Rea
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
hadn't gotten to us yet so it's just
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
that question of all right what do you
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
do to keep it unless you're keeping hogs
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
out behind every school for all the
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
waste uh it's not getting
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
processed very efficiently yes so
 
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
processed very efficiently yes so
they're

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.930 align:start position:0%
they're
um

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
most of the schools will be able to
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
handle this if they would be ordering
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
some food instead of other foods from
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
larger companies so it wouldn't be a
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
need I don't believe as for additional
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
storage it would just be replacing what
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing with more local food
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if they have the opportunity to
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
purchase local potatoes that were
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
lightly processed they could purchase
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
local potatoes or apples or carrots or
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
cabbage things that are also listed on
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
there like vocal Harvest of the month
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so being able to to offer something
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
along those lines on their menu with
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
these funds because it's not a large
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
amount of funds that are getting
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
distributed through this through this
 
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.810 align:start position:0%
distributed through this through this
bill

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
um but it's enough to allow schools the
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
Equitable opportunity to participate in
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing local food for their schools
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'll just give an example I was in a
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
conversation when I was working with
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
Stacy on a farm to school project with
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
um the food service director from
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
Bedford the food service director from
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
Exeter and the food service director
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
from Nashua and the food service
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
director from Exeter and the food
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
service director from Bedford had plenty
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
of funds to be able to purchase local
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
foods but the food service director from
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
Nashua even though they're from a larger
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
School District did not have the same
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
amount of funds to be able to purchase
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
local foods and so this bill would
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
provide an equitable opportunity for
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
school districts that are from a lower
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
income areas to be able to purchase
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
local foods and participate in things
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
like the Local Harvest of the month
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
education program
 
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.410 align:start position:0%
education program
so

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
um and and I will just add that a lot of
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
the farm to school grants the federal
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
grants that are coming through and as
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
Stacy mentioned the arpa funds they do
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
help to address
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
um storage and distribution and any
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
additional costs that may need to be be
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
incurred in order to support local food
 
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.190 align:start position:0%
incurred in order to support local food
purchases

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.870 align:start position:0%
purchases
yeah

00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock yeah thank you
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mr and maybe out of line so please stop
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
me I missed the preceding meeting so and
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
I don't want to leave everybody else's
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
time but is it possible for
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
to get like a two-minute executive
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
summary of New Hampshire Foods hunger
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions what they do the hypothesis
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
just catch me up yeah New Hampshire
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions is an advocacy a
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide advocacy organization and we
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
work to improve participation in federal
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
um School meals snap Wick and the child
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
and adult care feeding program which is
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
for child care and Senior Care Centers
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
all right so I have uh I I have just a
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
curiosity question I I think I'm looking
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
more for an opinion than a piece of data
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
here we have received loads of
 
00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:58.069 align:start position:0%
here we have received loads of
information

00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:00.980 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education about
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
the percentages of kids that qualify for
 
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.380 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunches
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
and in looking through that information
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
prior to this meeting it looks according
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the doe data like the number of kids
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for free and reduced
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
lunch is dropping over time
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
what I would like to know from New
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions is whether or
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
not you think student hunger is dropping
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
or uh is there some sort of
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
disconnect between
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
the the data that we have which is only
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
as good as the paperwork that we get
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
right uh so is there a disconnect
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
between the data and the reality of
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
student hunger or not
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
I think there is a disconnect between
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
the data and or the data and
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
actual hunger I mean so the most recent
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
census pulse data tells us that
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
um 79 000 adults and households in New
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire said that they experienced
 
00:41:10.329 --> 00:41:10.339 align:start position:0%
food insecurity in the last seven days
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
370 plus thousand households in New
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire said that they had difficulty
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
paying for usual household expenses in
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
the last seven days
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and that's a lot of adults and
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
households for New Hampshire having a
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
million people 370
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
000 is quite a bit of people having a
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty paying their bills
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
um with food service programs in schools
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
specifically if children don't make it
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
to breakfast
 
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.550 align:start position:0%
to breakfast
um

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
in the morning because most schools
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
serve breakfast before the bell and not
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
after the Bell then they miss out on
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to have breakfast and
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
they may not have had dinner the day
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
before and it may be embarrassing to
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
highlight that they're hungry or
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
especially as the kids get older and it
 
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:55.700 align:start position:0%
becomes more
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing for a middle school or a
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
high school student to participate in
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
programs that are deemed for the poor
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
kids so I think that we do have an Under
 
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
reporting of actual hunger in schools
 
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:08.780 align:start position:0%
due to
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
to stigma due to how programs are
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
offered and also
 
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.890 align:start position:0%
offered and also
um

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
I would I would say that the pandemic
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
factors into some of
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
um the data that we're that we're seeing
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we have lower participation in
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
school meals because it was harder to
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
access them during the pandemic when
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
families were at home and may not have
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
been able and and parents were still
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
working and may not have been able to
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
make it to a certain pickup times
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
can I add one piece to that as well I
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't know what the data is exactly what
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you but also
 
00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:51.710 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you but also
because

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the federal government made lunches
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
free and accessible to everyone then
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time where
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
families didn't have to sign up for
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
meals and so we there in a sense of the
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gap in data there but also the LA
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
missing that practice of signing up
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
um and and being out of that routine
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
means that it was it's hard to get
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
everybody who needed to to sign up again
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
then when it changed back
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
um to needing to sign up for lunches as
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:31.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is more of a
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
comment and I'm not sure it's correct so
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
I I need to be corrected it seems to me
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
that what I remember about food stamp
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
participation in the state that
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
consistently year after year after year
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
40 of the people who are eligible for
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
food stamps do not apply for food stamps
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that's probably a factor
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you've raised that as a factor in
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
terms of people applying for eligibility
 
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have um low snap
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
participation and enrollment in our
 
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.730 align:start position:0%
participation and enrollment in our
state

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
um which we miss about 60 of our
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
population over the age of 60 who are
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
eligible but not enrolled
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and we do miss about 17
 
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:20.930 align:start position:0%
um and we do miss about 17
000

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
um children in households who are
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for SNAP but not enrolled and
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
um can help that is the more when we
 
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.410 align:start position:0%
um can help that is the more when we
just

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
um had passed in the last legislation a
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
um a snap outreach program so our state
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
is has applied for a snap outreach
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
program through the federal government
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
we have a subcontractor that will be
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
announced eventually once um the the
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
plan is approved and
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we'll hopefully see more enrollments
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
and food stamp or SNAP program and
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
when families are eligible for SNAP
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're directly certified for School
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
meals which can save a lot of paperwork
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
and the burden for families
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I can speak for myself when the
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
packet comes in it takes at least an
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
hour to sit down and fill out all the
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork that's required and then
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
um the school meals document is
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes included in that registration
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
packet but maybe not always as prominent
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
so I think it's an issue for families to
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
know that they if they fill it out it
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
not only helps their family with free
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals but it also helps with
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
other education funding that can help
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
their school and so changing the message
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
a little bit for people to say like
 
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
they're helping their school district by
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
applying and participating
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
is important and it's one of the reasons
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
why Medicaid direct certification is
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
also on our agenda of things to talk
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
about because we know that that will
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
help to enroll more families without the
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
burden of paperwork or the stigma of
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
identifying themselves as being in need
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh a follow-up
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
question on that uh process of funding
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
things when we started this process I
 
00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:16.220 align:start position:0%
requested some help from UNH contacts
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
about data that was available and what
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
they sent us was an international study
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
and the detail that leaps out to me that
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
they concluded was don't stop with
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
breakfast a breakfast only program does
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
not resolve the child hunger problem you
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
should school should offer meals
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
throughout today or at least at lunch
 
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.309 align:start position:0%
throughout today or at least at lunch
too

00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
is that something you would agree with
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
as a conclusion
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you have to have you know
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch served at schools
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
and in some districts a family dinner
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
um would be even helpful and that can be
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
attained through the cacfp program but
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
just to go back to breakfast New
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 47th in the country for
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
school breakfast participation we miss
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
about 7 800 students a day who are
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate but do not
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
participate in school breakfast and we
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
leave about 1.5 million federal dollars
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
on the table because of it so
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we try to change our terminology to
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
school meal programs because it's more
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
than just lunch and it's more than just
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
breakfast it's breakfast and lunch and
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
we know that those may be the only two
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
meals a day that a child has access to
 
00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:32.089 align:start position:0%
meals a day that a child has access to
yeah

00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
woodcock

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and this may not
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
be the correct time but but Simpson
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
brought it up so I can take advantage of
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
that uh we received uh through the good
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
work of Jennifer IV some information uh
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
a chart on different costs of things uh
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
and one of the costs that I do see here
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
you may have it from the federal we're
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
talking about the federal participation
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
last time where it's open to all
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
the last year right okay
 
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.650 align:start position:0%
the last year right okay
sorry

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
all right you can have some too okay
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you hey y'all
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so my question is is there a
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable or close or something
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
possible the guesstimation or good
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
estimation but what it would cost if we
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
address the nutritional needs as the
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
federal government did
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
for all students for breakfast and lunch
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
what would the annual cost be for the
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
state I understand that if we still
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
receive federal reimbursement funds
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
proportionately but they saw I was
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe we had that data from
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
because of the last year with the the uh
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
when the federal government actually did
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's that's a figure I
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
really like to to pursue because I think
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's the Avenue we need to pursue
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
do you remember you describe the
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
question did you miss it no I I no yeah
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
we I think that I would have to refer to
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education for that for
 
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:10.460 align:start position:0%
that number and we'd have to do a deeper
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data to have that exact
 
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.910 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data to have that exact
number

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
but is that is there yeah is that is
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
that number available somewhere it can
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
be it's no I don't unless I'll refer to
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
um if they have that number but I think
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
that that number would have to be
 
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:28.940 align:start position:0%
calculated okay thank you very much
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock just as a
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
clarification so you're talking about
 
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.410 align:start position:0%
clarification so you're talking about
the

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:35.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
meals for everybody program that took
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
place during a pandemic exactly I'm not
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
sure so let's see what the federal
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
government did during covet right now
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
obviously we saw the participation rate
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
be huge because everyone could have it
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the the stigma was taken away
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
because everyone had it yeah and the
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
food service knew how much money they're
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
going to get and it was very the
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
question is if we need to if we have
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
such a little participation in our
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
breakfast program it starts the day for
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
youngsters we have kids who are taking
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
the lunch program because they may not
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
be able to sign up and embarrassed and
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
we know educationally that's what they
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
need and we have the opportunity to do
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
it I'm just wondering why we are looking
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
at a war uh inclusive bill that says
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is what we need to do this is what
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's cost is it worth the investment
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah just Pro I my point of
 
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:22.700 align:start position:0%
clarification with you was not
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
justifying feeding kids my point of
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
clarification was that there's a certain
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the federal government
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in the school meals
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
program so what you're looking for is
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
what would it cost the state of New
 
00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:38.450 align:start position:0%
what would it cost the state of New
Hampshire

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:42.609 --> 00:50:42.619 align:start position:0%
yes if we were to be able if we
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
instituted that program I understand
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's August manager and understand the
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to do their
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
proportional reimbursement as they
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
normally would for a freemovies okay I
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
just want to know what our cost would be
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
for the state so we could know what the
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
know what the best we can do for our
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
youngsters just making sure you weren't
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
trying to live free by uh separating us
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
from the federal dollars and taking on
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
our own independent lunch program thank
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
you representative woodcock so I'm sorry
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
could I just respond to that I I would
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
say that there are a lot of
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
opportunities if we can put all the
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
right pieces into place as far as
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification would
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
identify more students that would be
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced meals that direct
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
certification process would mean that
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
more schools would be eligible for
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
something they call the community
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility provision
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
if a school participates in that can
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
offer free meals to all their students
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
and get reimbursed for a certain
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
percentage of their students based on
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of formula so not getting
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
into the weeds of it too much but they
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
can be reimbursed by the federal
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
government for feeding more students and
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
then that usually will bring in more
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
income for food service programs the
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
problem is if it's a large school
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
district or School District that
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
um has a lot of schools it's it's really
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
hard to implement and that's why we only
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
out of 13 schools were eligible for this
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
program right now in New Hampshire we
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
only have three that participate in it
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
um so we would need things in place like
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
more snap enrollment or Medicaid direct
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
certification in order to identify more
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible to offer free
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
meals to more school districts with the
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement and taking the
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
pressure off the state for that
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursement thank you thank you
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
I'm curious do you know
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
do you know why we have such little
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
participation for breakfast when it's
 
00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
participation for breakfast when it's
available

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
um what we're understanding is that if
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
breakfast is offered
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
um before the ball and not after the
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
Bell then students have to get to school
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
early to be able to go in and
 
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
participate it's often stigmatized as
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is you know when you're getting in
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
older grades that breakfast is for the
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
kids who don't have money
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
um it also if you're thinking about
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
younger students it's a social time for
 
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
them before they go into the classroom
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
so if their friends are outside hanging
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
out on the playground playing they're
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
less likely to go in and have that
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
breakfast so on what we find the
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
evidence-based is that if you offer
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
um for younger kids that's in the
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
classroom or grab and go for them to
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
take back to the classroom for middle
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
school and high school students as a
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
second chance breakfast or a grab and go
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
Second Chance means that during their
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
morning break period they can go back to
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria and have breakfast again
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and it and that's those are
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based models used throughout
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
the country and when those are have been
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
implemented we've seen huge increases in
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
participation we did this model in one
 
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
school in Dover and saw 40 increase in
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation when we offered
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bell and we only
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
piloted in fourth grade but saw an
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
increase throughout the school because
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
kids were talking about it and breakfast
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
because there it takes a lot of systems
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
change within just a school district to
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
make it happen you have there has to be
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
um there's quite a few stakeholders in
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
the decision-making process and so part
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
of our job at New Hampshire hunger
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
Solutions is to work with school
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
districts to find ways to make it happen
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
but it also means getting the custodial
 
00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:39.980 align:start position:0%
staff involved teachers involved
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
principals the superintendents School
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
nurses parents and students and it's
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
been a little bit of a challenge during
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
the pandemic to have all those players
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
at the table when there's a lot of
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
staffing issues and other stressors
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
going on but we do see promise and we
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
have we actually just hired a Child
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
Nutrition director who's with us here
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
today that'll be helping to support that
 
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:05.660 align:start position:0%
work around the state thank you welcome
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh thank you for
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
taking thank you for taking my question
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I simply I want
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
a second what what Steve has said and I
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand the complications that locals
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
at the local school district level in
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
terms of implementing a new set of
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
guidelines or revised guidelines and how
 
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to work together if
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
someone involved in the Medicaid
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
certification thing I think those of us
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
on this committee want to know how much
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
is it going to cost to make sure that
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
every single kid in school in New
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets breakfast and gets lunch
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I I understand the variables and you
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
know we're if if if if but we want to
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
know what that number is or what that
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
number should be that would be helpful
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
to us and I understand there's a series
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
of guesses that go into that but I I
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
would like it to be that specific
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Woodcock
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up comment to
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas's question about
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
why don't we do it one of the reasons we
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
don't do it is last year a bill to
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
provide the 30 schools that don't
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
provide breakfast and voted down that's
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%

though uh I understand that you're here
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
as a guest at this point
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
um all right so um committee members I
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
want to refresh your memories that
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
during the first week of August I sent
 
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
during the first week of August I sent
you

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
a document that was created by Jennifer
 
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.549 align:start position:0%
a document that was created by Jennifer
four

00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
that answered a number of questions that
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
we had generated at the meeting prior to
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that everyone has had a
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it and digest it
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
but I want to call your attention to it
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
because if we don't discuss this today
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
then we will be discussing it at our
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
next meeting
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
it is uh basically a body of knowledge
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
that she was able to pull together
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
regarding states that have similar
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
demographics to New Hampshire and what
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
kinds of things they have implemented or
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
found to be helpful in addressing
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
student hunger in those States
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
comment first of all were you able to

of information for the dialogue yeah
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
okay all right so then um it looks to me
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
like I'll be giving you a homework
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
assignment which is basically to review
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
this document that came in as I said the
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
first week of July from me so if you
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
need to go hunt it down again it'll be
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
under my name
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
um it has
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
as it has position and summary
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
statements from a variety of States
 
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.230 align:start position:0%
statements from a variety of States
Delaware

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and it also uh goes
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
through the uh financials of what
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
happened in the state of Maine because
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of not only demographic
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
similarities to New Hampshire but also
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
population wise weather-wise
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
and the boilerplate language for any of
 
01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:12.380 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that they passed is in it
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
is in that document so if you do have
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
trouble just when you look at it you'll
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%
see that Jennifer Ford's memo and
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
summary uh is first but then there are
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
additional documents that you're going
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
um also representatives Murray and
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
Simpson if you would like to look at
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
those documents I'll be happy to forward
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
them to you as well
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
yeah just because we don't need to
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel when the wheel is in
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of the room all right great
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh uh yeah okay anybody really seriously
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
anybody that would like to see those
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
documents I'm happy to provide them if
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh you want to representative Tanner can
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
I put you in charge of putting a piece
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
of paper on the end of that table that
 
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.970 align:start position:0%
of paper on the end of that table that
uh

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:06.980 align:start position:0%

would like a copy of this
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's the easiest way to do it I think
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
all right comments uh questions from the
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%

to discuss anything that you would like
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%

going or what were we where that closure
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
point and Implement that type of
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
property could you mean are we ever
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to stop talking about student
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
hunger in New Hampshire no
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock we're not
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
um my timeline is this I would like to
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
call our next meeting for somewhere
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
around October or 456 somewhere in there
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
our report on this committee is due on
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
the 28th and representative Ladd has let
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
it be known that we will be having a
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
full Education meeting I believe
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
somewhere towards the latter part of
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
October to look at all the interim study
 
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.370 align:start position:0%
October to look at all the interim study
recommendations

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.690 align:start position:0%
recommendations
so

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
if any of you have a problem with uh
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
four five six seven some that that week
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
prior to Columbus Day
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
let me know but otherwise I'll be asking
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd to coordinate with
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
me so that we don't duplicate efforts
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
again and schedule ourselves I had to we
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
had you guys scheduled in two places at
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
the same time so uh we'll try to avoid
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
that moving forward I I see that
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock as our last
 
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.390 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock as our last
meeting

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
so yeah so during that meeting we will
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
consider uh the research from Jennifer
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
four we can uh look back and discuss any
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the information that we gathered from
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger Solutions school to
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
farm uh the doe any any concerns that or
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions anybody has and then at that
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
point what we will be doing this is it
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
you know when you're the chair of the
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
study to have a study uh it's an
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
interesting motion that needs to be made
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
I guess we will have to we'll have to
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
make a motion to either recommend or not
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
but we will not be recommending specific
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in other words you don't
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
have to have an LSR in front of you to
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
propose what will be deciding as a
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
committee is whether or not we think the
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
issue warrants additional legislation
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
yes sir just finally oh boy to get on
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
ever since I've been in the house here
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm going on this will be my 15th
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
16th year coming up and it's been a
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
topic of a discussion that just seems
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
like you know Groundhog Day and it just
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
comes and goes around and around and
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
around and yet we are still hassling out
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
with some of those major issues and
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
components that this legislation is
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
trying to address
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
there are some issue and points within
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
it that I think everybody can come up
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
and say well I don't necessarily agree
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
with that but I I'd like to try to
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
get away from that perspective and find
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
out what do we really have to do to
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues which we have
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
here in terms of funding of Education in
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so with that
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to have uh Dave if you would
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
please give a you know a brief overview
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
of of this legislation to get everybody
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
up to snap
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know be be uh be pleased to do that
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
actually I was wondering if I could um
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
if we could if Mel could um maybe um say
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
a few words just just that would be fine
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
you know you know and that's what I like
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
to have brief because I had about an
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
hour and a half session on Friday with
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
Bill ardinger and it started out being
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
only like a 40 minute meeting and it
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
went and went and went we were at the
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
trustee meeting together over at UNH
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester so try to give the overviews
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
succinctly if you would I don't mind who
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
wants to do it nope well Mel's going to
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about about some of
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
the some of it and then I'll I'll sort
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
of lay out the problems that that this
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill goes uh thank you Mr chair I think
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
the issue here as you said that school
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
funding has been on the docket here in
 
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:45.380 align:start position:0%
the legislature for a number of years
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
and the Dilemma that we have
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
is how do we get a comprehensive look at
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
this in the past
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the past we basically have
 
01:33:58.139 --> 01:33:59.390 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the past we basically have
tinkered

01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
tinkered
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
with the formula we've tinkered with the
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
concepts around it and uh
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
more recently we had in 2008 Governor
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
Shaheen had a major committee that
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
looked at this issue and again they
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
tinkered around with it in 2018
 
01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.530 align:start position:0%
tinkered around with it in 2018
representative

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
umberger housed the committee of which
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
both myself and you were on it as well
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
as Glenn cordelli was on it and again we
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
tinkered with it around the issues
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
around it we've never really looked at
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
the the core basis of how we provide
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
Equity around funding
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that prompted me to then
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill that created the
 
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.770 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill that created the
commission

01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the commission basically was uh its
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
charge was to take a deep dive we hadn't
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
taken a deep dive at this really until
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh since the middle 80s when uh uh we
 
01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.229 align:start position:0%
uh since the middle 80s when uh uh we
had

01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
um uh Ogden Blick came in a a consultant
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
came in and looked at it and made some
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations those recommendations
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
were not followed by the uh by the house
 
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and so you come up
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
with uh Claremont one Claremont 2
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Dover
 
01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.410 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Dover
Etc

01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
and each time he's not really did have
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
done the Deep dive this commission and
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
did that work we worked uh started uh
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
right in March right when the covets hit
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
in so we had a lot of Zoom calls uh we
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
spent a year looking at this in 2020 and
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
made recommendations I think it's
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
important to note too that when the
 
01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.790 align:start position:0%
important to note too that when the
original

01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
formula was created
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
we basically
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
did one one thing we looked at the input
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
part of what it cost the input section
 
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
deals basically with well what's the
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
average teacher salary what's the
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
benefit packages how many desks are in a
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
room how many administrators that dealt
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
with things at the time that the concept
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
was created we had no we had no data no
 
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
metrics that dealt with student
 
01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.430 align:start position:0%
metrics that dealt with student
performance

01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
and so if a commission really tried to
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
look at was not only to look at the
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
issue of the input model
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
which we currently have but what might
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
be another model that would be able to
 
01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.910 align:start position:0%
be another model that would be able to
track

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
track
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
student performance and this is a whole
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
new concept for us and so that's what we
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
we looked at David was the chair of this
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to turn it over to Dave
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
and let him basically look at the
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
 
01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.169 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
that

01:36:38.169 --> 01:36:38.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
commission thanks
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank thanks Mel
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah and you know I think what what
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
what Mel's also talking about is um is
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
the fact that um that you know we we're
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate I think in 2020 for the
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
school funding commission to have 10
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
years worth of data collected by the
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
department where we could actually
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
evaluate everything from from a school
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
district budgets to student outcomes in
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
every District to how money was being
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
spent or budgeted in um uh in every
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
district and uh and uh through a uh a
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
group of um of Consultants that are
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
really experts in education funding and
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
experts in economics they were able to
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
evaluate that and um and and some facts
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
dropped out some results dropped out of
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
that that I think probably were not um
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
you know are not um you know mysterious
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
to anybody but uh but in school
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
districts that have higher incidents
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
incidents of of poverty student outcomes
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
were were significantly lower and um and
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
um uh student outcomes were also tended
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be lower in school districts that had
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
limited access to financial resources
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
meaning that their property valuations
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
were much lower than um than than State
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
average and you know there are there are
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
combinations of dis there are districts
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
where where you know where they don't
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
have both of those to um uh two factors
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
but those those two factors were
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
certainly um certainly certainly drove
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
um student out a drop in student
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes lack of access to funding and
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
high instances of of poverty so um so
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
although New Hampshire overall has uh
 
01:38:41.209 --> 01:38:41.219 align:start position:0%
has very strong student outcomes top
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
five uh in the in the country we're not
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
seeing that universally across um not
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
even close to that across school
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
districts so um
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
so what house bill 1680 does is
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
basically responds to the the
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
information that the school funding
 
01:39:03.649 --> 01:39:03.659 align:start position:0%
commission learned and uh and develops a
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
proposed proposes to um uh a a model for
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
costing uh uh what what it what it would
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
cost for a school district to educated
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
students to a to us to a Statewide
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
outcome uh based on the student and
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
District characteristics uh how to go
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
about funding that um uh that that
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
school every school district's budget
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
based on their access to local resources
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
and then the state coming in and making
 
01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
sure that they can they can get all the
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
way and an accountability section that
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
that looks at student outcomes and the
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
important linkage here in fact more than
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
half I think probably close to half of
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the of the 26-page bill something like
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is actually the accountability
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
section and that accountability section
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
is based on student outcomes and the
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
importance of this
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and and the the I guess the rationale
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
behind this is that the costing and the
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
funding is also based on student
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes so so there's actually a
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
rational connection between between how
 
01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:16.460 align:start position:0%
students are doing and how we go about
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh costing uh uh and and funding our our
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
local school districts
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the um there's a there's a a third
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
section to the uh uh to House Bill 1680
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
which uh which which is actually a bill
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
that was just had an uh interim study uh
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
work session in the Ways and Means
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
Committee and it's called House Bill 504
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's contained in the the
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
last uh part of house bill 1680. and um
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
and it looks at uh at a couple of things
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
that I think are also relevant to uh to
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
school funding uh that uh that certainly
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of the of the one
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
billion dollars that the state of New
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire spends on on public school
 
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
district uh school districts comes from
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the state property tax the swept
 
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax and so
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
um so the the swept currently
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
incorporates a um a blanket
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
um uh tax rebate mechanism based on
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
where you live so if you're in a
 
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.100 align:start position:0%
property wealthy District than than
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
essentially you you you get a rebate and
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
an excess grant for back from the state
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
currently that's in the 35 million
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
dollar 40 million dollar range and um
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
and what that results in it certainly is
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
property tax relief for for people that
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
live in those communities but uh but it
 
01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:51.179 align:start position:0%
also results in an effective uh lower
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
tax rate for the State Property Tax
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
which um uh which is on its face
 
01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
blatantly unconstitutional so household
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
504 and through its incorporation in
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
1680 goes about uh goes about correcting
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
that so that the state property tax will
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
be collected the same way any other
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
state uh state taxes uh in this case be
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
collected locally and then remitted to
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
the uh to the state and um the second
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
part is
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the um you know the intent of uh of
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
property tax relief uh uh should really
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
be directed to uh to low and moderate
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
income uh homeowners and not be based on
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
solely where you uh where you live
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of of household income so um
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
so it it recognizes the importance of a
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
property tax relief uh uh mechanism and
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and uh and incorporates that actually
 
01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
builds out our current
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
um low and moderate income property tax
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
relief with uh with additional funds and
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
um uh and and higher levels so that uh
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
the the benefits would be closer to I
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
think a thousand dollars uh off property
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
taxes which for for a lot of low and
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
moderate income families across the
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
state would be very meaningful so um so
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're hoping today that that just like
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh chairlad uh said that while the um
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
well the mechanisms in 1680 may not be
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
exactly what everybody what everybody
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
wants and certainly I think require a
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
substantial uh you know additional
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
debate that that the um that the
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
problems that 1680 is directed to that
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
being student and taxpayer fairness that
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
being accountability that's tied to to
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh to to funding based on outcome
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
costing and funding based on outcomes
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that that um that districts across the
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
state don't need a one-size-fits-all uh
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
funding plan but something that's
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
reflective of the challenges and the
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
differences in each school district and
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
then um and then important changes to uh
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
to the state property tax and property
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
tax relief program at the end of the day
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a plan that that gets
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
phased in over a 10-year period so it's
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
not a drop at all in in the first year
 
01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:17.780 align:start position:0%
it has a a
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
transition plan for um uh for for for
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
local property taxes that that phases
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
out over uh over a period of of five
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
years and that would rely on covid money
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
to uh to do that so I think we've got a
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
sort of a once in a generation uh maybe
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
once in a lifetime opportunity to take
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
advantage of available funds uh for that
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
and um and and that it um
 
01:44:50.090 --> 01:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh it's worthy of um of further
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
discussion in the next session so I'm
 
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
hoping this committee will uh we'll find
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
it um uh we'll find it and recommend it
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
for uh for future legislation just the
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
as the house weights and Means Committee
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
just did um unanimously with um with the
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
state property tax for um for Education
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
portion of it thanks thank you very much
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
Dave and and Mel uh are there any
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
questions from the subcommittee to
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
either representative or representative
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
Meyler who just spoke reference the the
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
high 30 000 view our purpose
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay I I like to move on you you did
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
mention uh one area and there's a lot to
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
be discussed here obviously
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
accountability and student outcomes is
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
something we want to get into uh however
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
I understand that there is recently a
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
letter written by the state senate here
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
to the governor addressing the issue of
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
sweat I've not seen that letter and
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
Senator not not not swept I think this
 
01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid sir okay is that that was that
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
one for me good yeah we need to have
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah Jade you will copy of that
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time here
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
and and that was on that and that was
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous all 24 23 Senators okay
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
it's coming in a bipartisan manner he
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%

would be appreciated uh certainly not
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that we espouse too the the
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
more you know the right now flip through
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
the free and reduce program we're not
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
getting all these students that are
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
eligible signing up as we know in the
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
high school this big drop off and that
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
affects everything we do from adequacy
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
to Career Tech which we've talked about
 
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
in the past and the funding from the
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
federal government we're missing out on
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
on huge dollars Rick Rick just to
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
quantify that uh the FY 20 free and
 
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:30.290 align:start position:0%
quantify that uh the FY 20 free and
reduced

01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
um and this is the state grant adequacy
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
grant 86 million dollars FY 22
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
it goes down to 64 million dollars yeah
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's a whole that's a whole
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
Topic in itself in terms of how schools
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
are handling that with meals for kids
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know or not providing and it also
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
then it's a direct uh relationship to
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
how we're doing everything in the
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy there and the funding that's
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
coming to us and and it even ends up
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
impacting property taxes yes you had a
 
01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.010 align:start position:0%
impacting property taxes yes you had a
question

01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
I did Mr chair it seems please my mind
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
is not in legislative mode okay I have
 
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
to admit that but didn't we have a
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
proposal that came before the house and
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
was defeated for that Medicaid
 
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.629 align:start position:0%
was defeated for that Medicaid
usage

01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
did that happen or am I did and that was
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
you know the how one read that bill was
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
how it was interpreted whether in fact
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
we were giving doe the authority to go
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
ahead and implement or whether we're
 
01:48:39.649 --> 01:48:39.659 align:start position:0%
giving them the authority to go and
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
research and see what it would take to
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
become a member of that program with
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the USDA but I understand the pilot
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
program itself is coming to a real close
 
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.790 align:start position:0%
program itself is coming to a real close
here

01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
within a month yeah yeah the application
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
period and that that's a significant uh
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
issue that we need to address but do we
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
have time
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
I mean if the house is defeated that
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just confused where it is in
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
the process is this two different
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
processes that's the house yeah two two
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
different things the the
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
um our our current funding mechanism is
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it's important because it's
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
what's in place right now right and and
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
it relies heavily on on on the the
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I think paper application student
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
applications or family applications for
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
their students to apply for free and
 
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:35.930 align:start position:0%
their students to apply for free and
reduce

01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
um uh lunch uh program and so that's
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
used for two things used for the
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
students to get free introduced price
 
01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:44.219 align:start position:0%
lunch but it's also used in the
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
calculation of the adequacy grant which
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
has dropped by 20 million dollars just
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
just because of a change in the free and
 
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch right um participation but
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
the question that I had was more getting
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
into this pilot program if we had if we
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
brought that
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
um up to the house in a bill which we
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
did you said Mr chair and it was
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
interpreted in a different way and
 
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:08.450 align:start position:0%
interpreted in a different way and
defeated

01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
do we have time do we need the
 
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:13.100 align:start position:0%
legislators legislations
 
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
legislature's approval to get into that
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program and have we already denied
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
that the department the department can
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
do that the department can do it without
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
us correct okay thank you very much it's
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the department can
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
make application okay uh into whether we
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
get involved in that program it's a
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
different issue from the state
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of the the department will
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
they can make the application and get
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
all that information but for us then
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
then to get engaged in that as a there's
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
no financiality issues associated with
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and all that uh which which
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
which need to be looked at but it's very
 
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
important if we don't go that route then
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
how do we get a hold of some of the
 
01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
revenues which we need to get a hold of
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
and you know it's concerning me as the
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
school principal years ago I used to
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
when I had a family come in and request
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
and be eligible for free or reduced
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
meals and the elementary children
 
01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
brought it in and the middle school kids
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
sort of brought it in and the high
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
school kids blew it off we were not
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
gaining revenue for all those kids and
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
the principal has the option
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent of making some exceptions
 
01:51:28.609 --> 01:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
and saying I'm going to approve this
 
01:51:31.729 --> 01:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
knowing that the circumstance exists
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage our Administration
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
out there in the field that if you get
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
it in from a family it should be good
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
for all in that family
 
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:42.659 align:start position:0%
and I don't know for Nestle doing that
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
in all our districts
 
01:51:45.179 --> 01:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
in all our districts
representative

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with your assumption
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
that we can apply and then decide
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
whether or not to do it I actually had
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
in my possession the application form
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
and it specifically says that if you
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
apply you are guaranteeing that your
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
state will participate so we have to
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
know that we are absolutely going to
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
participate and share all that
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
information which is confidential and
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
that information has to be shared as
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
part of the application or we have to
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
decide we're not going to but we can't
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
apply and then decide whether or not to
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
do it because we are actually in the
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
application is signing that yes
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely we are going to do this
 
01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:32.629 align:start position:0%
absolutely we are going to do this
program

01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the issue and
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that's why we are where we are right
 
01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.689 align:start position:0%
um that's why we are where we are right
now

01:52:40.689 --> 01:52:40.699 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:52:40.699 --> 01:52:42.649 align:start position:0%
now
unfortunately

01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
so let's get back to this particular
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
bill here 1680
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
um and if we could get a hold that
 
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
letter J I'd appreciate it
 
01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:52.370 align:start position:0%
letter J I'd appreciate it
um

01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
that the 1680 has a number of components
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
within it and I'd like to start off with
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
just a brief discussion on one of those
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
components if we may on the the formula
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
that's and I'd like to see where we
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
stand as a committee just sort of as
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
informational on the weighted components
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
of special education under
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid as you recall in that
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill there was a weighted component if
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
you were eligible for special education
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
I think it was four point something
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
times the 4.9 or 4.6 I don't have it in
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
front of me times the the base adequacy
 
01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
front of me times the the base adequacy
amount

01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
um we then passed a Amendment last year
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
remember we were talking about
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
um I think it was sent off this off my
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 420 I believe was the
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
education extraordinary needs Grant we
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
added an amendment in which added
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
another 15 million dollars for two
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
categories of special education Aid uh
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
where we uh took the 13 IEPs and there
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
were three IPS we felt that could be
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
provided at the cost that we presently
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
have that was a lot right around two
 
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in differentiated aid
 
01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:01.910 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in differentiated aid
for

01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
for special education and the other 10
 
01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:08.900 align:start position:0%
categories were basically doubled
 
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
and that increased the amount that would
 
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
come through a two schools by the amount
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
of 15 million dollars for the total of
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
what the significant hunk of money but
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
that was rejected in past honor
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously went out of the
 
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
house and got killed in finance division
 
01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
house and got killed in finance division
two

01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:54:31.129 --> 01:54:31.139 align:start position:0%
I thought well we we brought it up in
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee a conference but that didn't
 
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
um it was basically said the letter that
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
I got back from the chair of division
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
two now the chair of Finance was this is
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
a great idea pursue it in next session
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
well the next session's upon us
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's just one of the components
 
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
one of the weighted categories within
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that and I'm trying to say are we all
 
01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
still there saying that's a good idea to
 
01:54:59.570 --> 01:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
be waiting out different categories I'm
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
not saying that formula is correct I'm
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
just saying now the the the concept of
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
doing that yes represent luno yep Rick
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
thanks I I I support obviously we all
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
supported it I believe when it came
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
through this committee when your
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment came through the committee
 
01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:17.219 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I would certainly support
 
01:55:17.219 --> 01:55:18.169 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I would certainly support
it

01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
um in a in a in in a in a funding as
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
part of a costing formula as well
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
um uh as long as we're able to get those
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know those adms from the um from
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
the Department I think that was um that
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
was something that um that we'd had some
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
some challenges with early on uh in uh
 
01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
in breaking down to the what 13
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
different categories yeah I'm gonna pass
 
01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
to blend those into two categories if
 
01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
that puts the department into an easier
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
position where they can provide those
 
01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:00.679 align:start position:0%
those 80 that ADM information
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think that makes a lot of sense
 
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I've I've talked to
 
01:56:09.290 --> 01:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
um doe and Rebecca for for that could
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
not be here today do that she's at a out
 
01:56:15.169 --> 01:56:15.179 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of Concord
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
but the three categories which we have
 
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see there in category a where
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
developmental delays specific learning
 
01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
disabilities speech and language
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
impairments and then everything from
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
autism through multiple disabilities to
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
other health impairments was in that
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
second category
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think necessarily we need be
 
01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
looking that specifically what goes in
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
which category I think we need to work
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
with our department and trying to
 
01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
ascertain which uh
 
01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.750 align:start position:0%
ascertain which uh
um

01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
categories within the special ed
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
differentiated a require a lot more
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
attention from a staff member in a
 
01:56:54.129 --> 01:56:54.139 align:start position:0%
school and the costs of course increase
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
there is some data that I've gathered
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
National Data where that has been done
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I I've seen it I'll make copies for
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee so you can
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
see it because we're not going to
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
resolve everything here today and we'll
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
get that to you
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
um but I I think as you're saying it's a
 
01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
component within any formula even if we
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
stayed with a current formula we need to
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
modify this area I believe in special
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
education to more appropriately fund it
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
this would not fund it to where it needs
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
to be funded remember the feds are
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
guaranteed at 40 percent funding from
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
the national level which has never
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
occurred it's now what we're down close
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
to what 16 17 coming down and so it's
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's another thing which we're passing
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
on kind of like this
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
mandate to the property taxpayer and uh
 
01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to avoid that from
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
happening seeing idea is here and we
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose all the other money
 
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.330 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose all the other money
Glenda

01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
Glenda
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
does this uh thank you does this um
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
as far as my understanding of special
 
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
education there's a pool of money for
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
special education and depending on uh
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
what the different schools apply for
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
that special education uh then it's uh
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
determine what percentage of their
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
application is actually funded
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
um is that is my understanding that
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
there's there's two pots of money we're
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the adequacy money okay
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
this is not the money which is obligated
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
to every student that's eligible in this
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
state so whether you're donor a
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
non-donor town this is what you get
 
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
then you have what we call
 
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
special education Aid now catastrophic
 
01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
AIDS what they used to be called so when
 
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
you get three and a half times the
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
average cost of a student in the state
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
say the cost is 20 grand to the educate
 
01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
a student in the state so you go three
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
times that there'd be sixty thousand
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
dollars half of the 20 another so be
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars you have to
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
spend locally prior to your receiving
 
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
any state support at all
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
then the next component up to 10 times
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
that average amount the state kicks in a
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of that which is I believe
 
01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:13.460 align:start position:0%
what 80 percent so and then from 10 on
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
it's you're getting support from the
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
state for 100 of those kids it means
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
that this the local districts paying a
 
01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
huge hunk of money in special education
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to a superintendent just
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
the other day which they had a student
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
now that's up to the level believe it or
 
01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
not over four hundred thousand dollars a
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
year it's a small District they don't
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
have a backup Reserve or trust fund to
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
support that and that is where they hit
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
isn't there a set pool of money though
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
so for that catastrophic AIDs that
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it seemed like they even though
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
they apply for you know they reach the
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
70 000 and they apply for it because
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's then spread out amongst
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state that applies for
 
02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
that same money out of a pool of money
 
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
so it kind of is capped they only get a
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
portion of that um back is that is that
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's two
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
two answers that we did pass legislation
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
where districts can get together and
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
pool into a you know providing a a a
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue that they contribute
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
each year so much it's like an insurance
 
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.370 align:start position:0%
each year so much it's like an insurance
plan

02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
the other idea that we have there we do
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
have some emergency money available
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
through the state for these types of
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
students but it's very very little
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
and it's basically something which the
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
school districts can't count on
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
the the catastrophic Aid is based upon
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
that formula and that's what you as a
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
district have to front for the you you
 
02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
district have to front for the you you
must

02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
yes and it's for the prior year yeah
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
just like just like just like the
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula so so I'm hearing from
 
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
some schools that you know essentially
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
they're getting like a 20 20 on the
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
special ed costs that they have or 30
 
02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:11.330 align:start position:0%
special ed costs that they have or 30
because

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:01:13.490 --> 02:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
there's a limited there's a limited pot
 
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
of money at the state level for special
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
education that's a very small pot of
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
money I spoke about
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and that's just based upon uh where
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
they are towards the end of the year
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
they can prorate it out to school
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
districts but that is not that's it's
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's minimal marginal yeah
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
other questions on the special ad so is
 
02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:39.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
having this weighted formula within any
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
component of funding
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're still on board with this concept
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
that's good good so we'll move forward
 
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.830 align:start position:0%
with that
um

02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
Dave do you have anybody here that they
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking behalf of the bill
 
02:02:00.119 --> 02:02:00.970 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking behalf of the bill
um

02:02:00.970 --> 02:02:00.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks Rick I I you know didn't
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
really plan any any particular testimony
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
on this seeing as this is a work session
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
but um but again you know I think all of
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
the a lot of the bills that were were
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
talking about here well certainly 1680
 
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
and I think House Bill 504 are are
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
really directed at um at problems that
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
um that I think and I don't think it's a
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
partisan issue but I think problems that
 
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
that people have identified in certain
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
areas whether that's uh State Property
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
Tax whether that's school funding I
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
think there's people on all sides of the
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
aisle that that recognize that yeah we
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
got issues in these areas and I think
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's probably some people here that
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
that can speak to that one thing that we
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about this morning which
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
I think is also indicative that that
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's problems in this area or that
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
there's uh there's a couple of court
 
02:02:59.810 --> 02:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
cases one that's been filed I think over
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
two years one that's been recently filed
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
and um and Zach's Zach um Sheehan is
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
here and may be able to give a high
 
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
level overview of what what those cases
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
are about and the problems that they've
 
02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.109 align:start position:0%
are about and the problems that they've
identified

02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
yeah we can just I'd rather not get into
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
combat on the Polinsky issue just just
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
yet we today we can but I'd like to
 
02:03:25.129 --> 02:03:25.139 align:start position:0%
address some of the specific issues
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
within the bill like accountability
 
02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.129 align:start position:0%
within the bill like accountability
um

02:03:30.129 --> 02:03:30.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
accountability is something which I I
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
we really don't have a strong
 
02:03:39.169 --> 02:03:39.179 align:start position:0%
accountability plan for differentiated
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
Aid right now I went through last night
 
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at the pupil teacher
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
ratios in all our districts the average
 
02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
around 17-1
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
and then I also looked at achievement
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
scores of kids within the districts and
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a mixed thing where you can
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
have very very low pupil teacher ratio
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
and you still have a high percentage of
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
your students that are in levels one and
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
two those are the areas on the
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
assessment which are not performing I
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
know that's true I I'm looking at uh
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock over there and that's
 
02:04:14.089 --> 02:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
true in Conway
 
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
and very much true in Conway where you
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a very high percentage over there
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's close to 70 percent that have that
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
that are really not faring well yet
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
Conway does have some kind of a tax
 
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
property tax base
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so the and the accountability issue
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
to me comes at what point does the state
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
have the authority to come in and say to
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
local school you're not cutting it
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
represent Porter so I keep thinking back
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
to some research
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
um that was done back when I was
 
02:04:56.410 --> 02:04:56.420 align:start position:0%
teaching in public schools so that story
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
somewhat years now since I've been there
 
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
um and and it seems to be holding true
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
from what I've read since then that the
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
number one predictor of how kids do on
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
these tests is the education level and
 
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
the income level of the parents
 
02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
that so I just want to throw that out
 
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
there which might which might have
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
something to do with what's happening in
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
Conway that there's a lot of money there
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
in the homes of the children that are
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
being educated
 
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.649 align:start position:0%
being educated
there

02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
so just want to throw that out as a as a
 
02:05:39.649 --> 02:05:39.659 align:start position:0%
thought so communities like like uh
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton for example that has one of
 
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
the best schools districts in the in the
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
state they would have a lot they have a
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
lot of people in the community that are
 
02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
professionals and have high incomes and
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
a community like mine which is kind of
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
blue collar
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we have some you know we're improving
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
all along all the way but we don't have
 
02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
as many professionals High income people
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
in my community so they seem to
 
02:06:08.099 --> 02:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
in my community so they seem to
um

02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
so what I'm looking for anecdotally it
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
seems to still be accurate so I'm just
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
throwing that out there
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
how we can address that issue when we're
 
02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:21.500 align:start position:0%
addressing the funding how we can help
 
02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
that need it the most
 
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
where we can put our funding to help
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
those kids that need it the most
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
represent Cordell yeah I was just
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could take a look at the
 
02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
accountability section I know that oh
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you back in practice
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
um uh you mentioned a significant
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
portion of the uh the legislation was in
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
accountability can we take a look at the
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
accountability sections because you know
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're I think our
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
opportunities there for uh committee
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
agreement on a number of aspects of that
 
02:06:58.910 --> 02:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
sure I I actually don't have that
 
02:07:01.250 --> 02:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
section how many people don't have the
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you right now
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
so one two three four five six
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
Jen is it possible that we could get you
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
know a good 20 of those down here the
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
audience may want it as well
 
02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.410 align:start position:0%
audience may want it as well
here

02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:21.649 align:start position:0%
here
yeah

02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know I what you said representative
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
Porter regarding that is absolutely true
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
you look at a town like a Hanover
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
and and when I looked at the you know
 
02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
those students in Hanover which were in
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
the first or second quartile 17 percent
 
02:07:42.129 --> 02:07:42.139 align:start position:0%
then we're going to look at Rochester
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.679 --> 02:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay I'm sorry go ahead Linda so I
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
just want to caution this uh race
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
teacher to pupil ratio
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
um how if you just take the number of
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
students into school and divide it by
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
the number of teachers and come out to
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
the average that it isn't at all a clear
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
view of what happens in a school there
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
are some students in special ed for
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
example who have a teacher for Just Two
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
pupils or there may be Advanced uh
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
placement uh courses taught where there
 
02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:27.659 align:start position:0%
is one teacher for maybe 10 students and
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
yet there may be uh art music or phys ed
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
teacher who has 30 students in their
 
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
class so it it really isn't reflective
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh people think that they're going to
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
walk into school and see one teacher
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
with 17 kids in the class that's not
 
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to happen and I concur with you
 
02:08:47.089 --> 02:08:47.099 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know that that's why the
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh areas we don't want to get caught up
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
in that by
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
funding districts more money will just
 
02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
increase maybe that aspect of you know
 
02:09:01.129 --> 02:09:01.139 align:start position:0%
the lower our teacher pupil teacher
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
ratio yes that may be good but it may be
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
also wise not to necessarily put the
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
money there maybe wise to put it in how
 
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
much you're paying the teachers that you
 
02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:11.750 align:start position:0%
much you're paying the teachers that you
have

02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
um you know right now there's a teacher
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
shortage we have another committee
 
02:09:16.609 --> 02:09:16.619 align:start position:0%
looking at that right now and we're
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
really shallow on the on the sciences
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
and the maths on the special education
 
02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
how are we going to get more people and
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the pipeline out of uh the
 
02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
university level and the college level
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
are not delivering the numbers that they
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
need to deliver to us so why are we
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
having so few students going in that
 
02:09:41.089 --> 02:09:41.099 align:start position:0%
direction saying I'm not going to be a
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
teacher well maybe it's because of it's
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
hard to live on forty thousand dollars a
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
year or thirty five thousand dollars a
 
02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
year first as a person working where I
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
was on a oil platform out in the catch
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
back sea getting a hundred and fifty
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars now big difference
 
02:10:03.649 --> 02:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
yeah perhaps in Mila
 
02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair one of the things
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we did discover uh in our
 
02:10:11.330 --> 02:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
commission work
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh as it relates to effectiveness of
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
education is the attrition rate of
 
02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.770 align:start position:0%
education is the attrition rate of
teachers

02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
um there's no question that the magic
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
in a classroom takes place with a
 
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
creative teacher
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
that can work on a sustained basis
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
and when you have teachers that move in
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
and out of a district
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
it interrupts the continuity of the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum as well as administrators I
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
mean there's no question in my mind that
 
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
a pivotal person is that principle
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
that provides the energy that provides
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
the vision that provides the leadership
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
if you may around the curriculum but if
 
02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
in fact you have and I just take
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield as an example I mean John
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
Freeman former superintendent has been
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
in here several times talking about this
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
that if you if if Pittsfield it becomes
 
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
the farm team for Concord
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
and you have teachers that are in there
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
for maybe two or three years and then
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
they move to to a place where they can
 
02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
get like ten thousand dollars more
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
it disenfranchises that curriculum where
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have consistency
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that that I'm
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about as well as what we're
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
looking at in the teacher shortage issue
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
is how do you retain staff
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that knows those students that they're
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
working with that knows the curriculum
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's there that there's a there's a
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
Continuum there's a continuance of
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
continuity of presence of staff that
 
02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
knows those kids and knows that
 
02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
curriculum so above and beyond just the
 
02:11:59.209 --> 02:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
the fiscal aspect of schools
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
how do we keep teachers in those
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
buildings that know those kids
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
and that I think is a huge problem and
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
that does get back to the issue of
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
costing again I I hate to come back to
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
funding of it but it does if you have a
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
school district that is ten thousand
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
dollars below a neighboring School
 
02:12:18.659 --> 02:12:19.609 align:start position:0%
dollars below a neighboring School
District

02:12:19.609 --> 02:12:19.619 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm a young teacher that has loans
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
I've got to pay off and a young family
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
that maybe I want to think about buying
 
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
a house
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
the issue of funding does become a
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
critical issue so there's there's got to
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
be a balance between the funding issue
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
and the continuity of staff and I again
 
02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:41.099 align:start position:0%
I want to end emphasis I'm not just
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
talking about teachers I'm talking about
 
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
superintendents at one point in time
 
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
Rick you recall
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
several years back we were we looked at
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
Claremont and I think Claremont had five
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
superintendents in six different years
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
well how does that impact the staff as
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
it relates to their leadership within
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
so so it is a funding issue I agree
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
but it's Unique to individual
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
communities you may be living in a
 
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
municipality where you can't keep your
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
local police on board because they're
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
going down the river 40 miles and
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
getting a job that's going to add
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
another 20 grand onto their annual
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
salary that's happening where I am in
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
Haverhill they go to Hanover Lebanon and
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's so it's true in not just education
 
02:13:28.199 --> 02:13:29.629 align:start position:0%
it's so it's true in not just education
but

02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
everything else we have going on with
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
the municipal government
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
and so then it comes down to you know
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
that the funding that we have in our
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
formula but are we going to be able to
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
pick all that or will we have that
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
difference occurring in our state just
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
by the natural the way we are
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
rips and Woodcock and then thank you uh
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate the
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh two points uh anecdotally
 
02:13:57.169 --> 02:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
as representative four indicated uh
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
prior to sat is being used as the
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
standard measure when they're used for
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
college admissions as the initial
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
document that that uh demographic of
 
02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
two-parent educated income was was right
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
on for you could guarantee all the
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
scores on the bigger picture that that
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh president Miley to talk about
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
attrition in Conway it's a that's a a
 
02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
terrific uh measure because uh the two
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
schools now representative uh cordelli
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
lives down in that area with Prospect
 
02:14:30.649 --> 02:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
mountain and uh I would say on Glenn um
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
Kingswood thank you thank you
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um they are about fifteen thousand
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
dollars to start higher than Conway and
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
young teachers they don't have loyalty
 
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
to the community yet because they just
 
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
got there uh and so they realized that
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
the two or three years they've signed to
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
fill the toolbox the science whole thing
 
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
and they moved down to a wolf Pro area
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
on Walton Bowl area for that reason
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
because they don't really start figured
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
out of the lifetime so and it is a big
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
deal because we're training and losing
 
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
training and losing so that the people
 
02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
coming in I have new teachers and new
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
teachers and we all almost everyone
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
around this table has been in the
 
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
classroom they know it takes a while for
 
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
a new teachers not to fill that toolbox
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
and how to how do you get that youngster
 
02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
on board with a math class
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so it is that that attrition issue is
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
a huge issue in student learning and and
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh the retention nutritionist student
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
learning is is critical and I mean
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
that's the key if you don't have in the
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
classroom it doesn't matter how much you
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
find it
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
further comments representino
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
or and then representative Nelson no
 
02:15:41.149 --> 02:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair yeah I mean I
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
think the and and I know we want to you
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
want to move this into towards a
 
02:15:48.169 --> 02:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
discussion on on accountability but I
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize right
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
up front that that what house bill 1680
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
is proposing it is a comprehensive
 
02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
change to um to what we call school
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
funding but it um it's also a
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive change to um to the the
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
definition of an adequate education and
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
our current statute says an adequate
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
education is 50 desks in a classroom and
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
one principle for every 500 students and
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
one librarian for every 500 students and
 
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
a couple of buses and stuff like that
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
and um and what 1680 does is changes
 
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:29.300 align:start position:0%
that and says an adequate education
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
offers the opportunity for students to
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
perform at a Statewide uh outcome level
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
so was so that's average Statewide
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
outcome and you know on a national basis
 
02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:44.780 align:start position:0%
a very a very strong
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
outcome and um and by setting that
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
standard and then defining what a
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
District budget would be so that their
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
students could perform at a Statewide uh
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
level and that's going to be different
 
02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
for every District in the state and the
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill goes into that based on student and
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
District characteristics and then making
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
sure that every school district has
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need to do
 
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
that through what what has historically
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
been and what would continue to be in in
 
02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
this bill a partnership between local
 
02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and the state so
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
we're not telling local property
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that they're off the hook or
 
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
anything like that are not responsible
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
for education but making sure that that
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to
 
02:17:41.810 --> 02:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
um be taxed at an unreasonable rate like
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
so many uh communities so many school
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
districts are having to tax
 
02:17:47.929 --> 02:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
um uh out right now so the state makes
 
02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
sure that every school district have has
 
02:17:53.209 --> 02:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need after
 
02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
a reasonable local tax effort to uh to
 
02:18:00.049 --> 02:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
to meet that that budget based on the
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
cost for the school district for the
 
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
students to have an uh to to perform at
 
02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
a at a Statewide outcome and then that
 
02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
ties directly in to the ad to the
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
accountability portion uh which uh which
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
starts on page 10 of a 20-page uh Bill
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
and um and this is really important
 
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
because it really does provide the
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
feedback mechanism for um for budgets
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
and then and then School operations and
 
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
then an accountability that's based on
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
what that budget
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
um how that budget was was designed so I
 
02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
think it goes to a lot of the points
 
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
that are being made around here are you
 
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
paying teachers enough do you have
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
enough teachers do you have too many
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
teachers are you offering the right mix
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
of of um of of program or do you need a
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
different mix of program or do you need
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
different leadership in a district uh
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
and you know after uh after a number of
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
years and that's laid out in the
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
accountability section
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
um you can you can measure how the
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
students are doing are they are they are
 
02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
they starting to approach a Statewide
 
02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
outcome if not why not
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
and that's where that's where the
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
schools with the cooperation of the
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
department can put together a plan to
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
figure out what it is
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
um what it is they should be doing in
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
order for their students to um uh to be
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
to be getting to a Statewide outcome and
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and then the uh the mechanism for
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
calculating uh uh Statewide you know or
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
budgets for every school district based
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
on based on student student performance
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
that would also be Revisited at least
 
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
every I forget it's in the bill it's
 
02:19:47.089 --> 02:19:47.099 align:start position:0%
every five years or every ten years I
 
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
think it's not not uh at least every
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and um
 
02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.230 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and um
and

02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know from a from an engineering
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
standpoint makes a lot of sense because
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're starting with um with with
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
funding based on a goal student outcomes
 
02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
and then you're measuring that through
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
the accountability section when you
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
start out as a with a funding or a
 
02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
budget mechanism based on how many desks
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
in a classroom one
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
principal for every 500 students
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
um uh stuff like that then how does the
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
accountability part work
 
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
um uh you know other other than just
 
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
measuring how much stuff that you've
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
you've purchased so so I I you know I
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
think from a from a um from uh from the
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint of does it make sense budget
 
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
based on outcomes fund to make sure that
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
districts have access to the resources
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
they need and then accountability based
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
on those those outcomes makes a lot of
 
02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
sense we um we we can certainly
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think I think the bill needs
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
some work on on
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know how you define student outcomes
 
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
um you know Marjorie we've we've talked
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
about that maybe standardized tests
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
aren't the way to do it I mean right now
 
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
we look at Statewide assessment test
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and attendance rate but
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other uh I mean that's
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the department collects now so
 
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's what we had to work with but um
 
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
but and maybe that's a place to start
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
and um and and maybe you know maybe it's
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
something that uh that the bill could
 
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
also include some uh some uh additional
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
data collection from the Department so
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we can improve on our ability to uh
 
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
to measure student outcomes down the
 
02:21:41.050 --> 02:21:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a number of schools in
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state that are meeting
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
national standards they're meeting our
 
02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
state standards and their outcomes are
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
02:21:57.530 --> 02:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
then why do we have to change formula
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
why aren't we addressing the schools
 
02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
that are and let me read this one
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
section from this particular book which
 
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
was handed to us to me by Department of
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
Education it says if the current staff
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
is unable to raise student achievement
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
and the school district has failed to
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
correct the problem it is incumbent upon
 
02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
the state to get the school back on the
 
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
right track
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
we endorse more local control and
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
flexibility but for that to be effective
 
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
the state must be prepared to act at the
 
02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
local school district after a reasonable
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
period of time is clearly not getting
 
02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
the job done now we have a number of
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
school districts that aren't getting the
 
02:22:45.410 --> 02:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
job done my question is what have we
 
02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
done through the state to get them up to
 
02:22:48.899 --> 02:22:50.450 align:start position:0%
done through the state to get them up to
Snuff

02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
Snuff
 
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's the accountability that you know
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
do we have a hammer to do that do we
 
02:22:58.370 --> 02:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
have the curriculum staff At Doe to do
 
02:23:00.889 --> 02:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
that yes on that I think I was going to
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
follow up with what David was saying the
 
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
Dilemma that we've got is that right now
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
each School District gets 37.87 per
 
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.610 --> 02:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
one side sits off
 
02:23:23.410 --> 02:23:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.270 --> 02:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
we can't Target that money though my
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's my point okay okay you're ahead
 
02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
of me Rick that's the issue here is that
 
02:23:35.210 --> 02:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to talk about here is
 
02:23:38.809 --> 02:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
how do you begin to to identify where
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
there are problems
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
and provide the resources necessary to
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
fill those problems but here's the
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
Dilemma how do you avoid Claremont
 
02:23:48.889 --> 02:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
here's the dilemma though
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
who helps those districts that are in
 
02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
who helps those districts that are in
need

02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
the current State Department of
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
Education doesn't have those resources
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
David just talked about getting more uh
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
more analysis and data collection they
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
can't do it now
 
02:24:08.929 --> 02:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
so what we're suggesting here
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
is not just a funding formula
 
02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
but looking at what the Department of
 
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
Education can do and hasn't been able to
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
do don't forget what's 85 percent of the
 
02:24:22.370 --> 02:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
current staff of the department is
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
funded by federal funds I got all that
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
now but I'm worried about when I say
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
Claremont I'm not talking about the town
 
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the court decision oh
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay the court decision would
 
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and all that
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to Target money like this
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy form in the base in the
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
differentiated component and David yeah
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
so let's let's address that and and uh
 
02:24:51.889 --> 02:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
and if if representative Ames may want
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about this too um
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh this was an area that the school
 
02:24:59.570 --> 02:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
funding commission took uh took a a very
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
significant look at and we had a lot of
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony as you remember in this uh in
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
this area as well the um the the term
 
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.490 align:start position:0%
this area as well the um the the term
targeting

02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
targeting
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
um goes back a long time and and
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
um uh for members of the committee it
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
means that uh that the that the state
 
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
would um would um be giving
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
um uh more amount more financial
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
resources to some districts than to want
 
02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
them to than to other districts and um
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it and in some districts it may
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
be that those districts have access to
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
all the financial resources they need to
 
02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh to run their run their school
 
02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
district uh and to meet their um their
 
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
since Claremont and since Claremont New
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire implemented as you as you said
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
Rick a basically a uniform uh
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
costing slash funding model that doesn't
 
02:26:10.250 --> 02:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
matter doesn't matter if if if you're
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
the Newport School District or the
 
02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton school district or the Hanover
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
School District or the Newcastle School
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
District you get the same costing slash
 
02:26:23.330 --> 02:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
funding from the from the state in an
 
02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
amount pretty much what what Mel was
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
said about four thousand forty two
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars something like that per
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh per student after you sort of wash it
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
all out and um and for uh for some
 
02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.170 align:start position:0%
all out and um and for uh for some
districts

02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
well for every district and I think
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of arguments that say say
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know forty two hundred dollars
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't get you anywhere close to uh to
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
and to even even the the the uh per
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
pupil budget in in the district that
 
02:26:53.929 --> 02:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
spends the least amount of money per
 
02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
pupil the state which is Manchester
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't even get you halfway halfway
 
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
there pretty sure and um uh but for
 
02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
other districts it um you know that have
 
02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:07.220 align:start position:0%
that have access to tremendous resources
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh it uh it it does a lot for the
 
02:27:13.849 --> 02:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
students in those districts and
 
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
and and but it it hasn't done anything
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
for Hanover I mean for um Clermont
 
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't done anything for the plaintiff
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
from for the in the in the Claremont
 
02:27:25.969 --> 02:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
suit plaintiff towns so so I think the
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
the um you know our suggestion here is
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
that trying something different to close
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
those opportunity gaps across the state
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
so that a student who goes to Newport or
 
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
a student that goes to Claremont or
 
02:27:42.050 --> 02:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
Berlin or Pittsfield or Manchester has
 
02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
the same opportunities for success as a
 
02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
student who goes to Hopkinton or or Beau
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
or Bedford and um
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a couple ways
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
there well there's a lot of different
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
ways of achieving that house bill 1690
 
02:27:59.280 --> 02:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
ways of achieving that house bill 1690
um

02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
um offers one way the school funding
 
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
commission report offers about a half a
 
02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
dozen different ways uh of doing it this
 
02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
1680 being one of them
 
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and um and you know and one way of
 
02:28:18.770 --> 02:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
making making it compliant with with
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
with what uh with the chairs inter you
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
know with interpretation your
 
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it yes Rick is for the
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
state to pay the first and last dollar
 
02:28:32.410 --> 02:28:32.420 align:start position:0%
and um you know of of
 
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know on average 18 19 20 000 per per
 
02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:38.090 align:start position:0%
you know on average 18 19 20 000 per per
student

02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:28:41.889 --> 02:28:41.899 align:start position:0%
um that that's gonna put a significant
 
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
Challenge on on state revenues what 68
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
does is starts with what we're spending
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and and works through organic
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know as as economies
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
grow and um uh can uh can can phase in
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
over over a 10-year period doesn't put
 
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
any demands on new new tax sources it
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
does clean up I think a a constitutional
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
problem that we have with the state
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
property tax but but it doesn't put the
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
state in a position where it's spending
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
the first and last dollar for um for
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
school districts on what districts are
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
spending today and any and it it doesn't
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
level set budgets for school districts
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say all right you know it's
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to cost you reasonably you know
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars per student or
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars per student or
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars it doesn't do
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
that either it's actually looking at at
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
the the differences that in the
 
02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
challenges that every school district
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
um has and you know I'm gonna overuse
 
02:29:49.849 --> 02:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
you know you know something to sell time
 
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
but it costs more to educate a thousand
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
kids in Manchester than it does a
 
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
thousand kids in Bedford
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
why well I could easily say it just does
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
but because the Thousand kids in
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester present significantly
 
02:30:05.929 --> 02:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
different challenges for the Manchester
 
02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
School District than the Thousand kids
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
in Bedford do and and so that's what
 
02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
1680 com contemplates so it comes up
 
02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
with with a budget or a cost which is
 
02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
separate from funding
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
currently costing and funding is the
 
02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
same thing for every District
 
02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
comes up with the with the budget for
 
02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:28.490 align:start position:0%
comes up with the with the budget for
costs

02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:30:31.090 --> 02:30:31.100 align:start position:0%
uh and then takes a look at a District's
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
ability to access resources to fund that
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
budget at a reasonable you know through
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable local tax effort and then the
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
state targets
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
the state funding to get the district
 
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
the rest of the way is Manchester going
 
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
to need more help yep Manchester is
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
going to need more help is Newcastle
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to need more help nope newcastle's
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
not going to need any more help
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what that does so it
 
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
works with this the state's existing
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
billion dollar you know plus or minus
 
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
um uh what the state's currently
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
spending uh on it so so it's a couple of
 
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
things it's fair for students it's fair
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers and I think it's fiscally
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
conservative you know in terms of um in
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
terms of what what sort of financial
 
02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
obligations it places on the state of
 
02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for ensuring that every
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
student gets a um uh an opportunity for
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and yeah there's
 
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
other ways you can do it
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
um but um uh and I think you know I I'm
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hopeful that someday we'll see
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
something like this and yep maybe it'll
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
get uh maybe it'll get challenged but
 
02:31:44.210 --> 02:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
our current funding mechanism is getting
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
challenged because it hasn't made a
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
difference to students in Claremont or
 
02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
any of the plaintiff districts since the
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
Claremont case when was um was
 
02:31:57.170 --> 02:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and um and certainly we can
 
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
do better and that's what 1680
 
02:32:04.250 --> 02:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and you know uh attempts to do and
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'll work with them I think you know
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
dick and Mel and I and Jay uh work with
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
anybody to um to to try to get there at
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
the final level whatever we put in place
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
has to be bipartisan it's got to be
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
durable it's got to be something that
 
02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
stays around
 
02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
um you know for the next 10 20
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
plus years so let's let's get back for a
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
second to what represent cordellia had
 
02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
suggested let's look at the
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
accountability section within this
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and that's a
 
02:32:42.849 --> 02:32:42.859 align:start position:0%
concern I think I have as well that how
 
02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
if it whatever we're going to do with a
 
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
funding formula how are we going to hold
 
02:32:50.690 --> 02:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
the districts accountable with this
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
issue of local control
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
or what kind of measure are we going to
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
use to measure that they're performing
 
02:33:00.650 --> 02:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
to this outcome that we're desirous of
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
achieving is it going to be the
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment that we use
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
is it going to be
 
02:33:09.770 --> 02:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
discipline in the schools is it going to
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
be you know the tenure of a an
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
individual the longevity in in there the
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
the leadership within the facility the
 
02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
all the there's so many issues the the
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
turnover of the darn local school board
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
that impacts it tremendously
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
um the education levels within the
 
02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
community there there are so many
 
02:33:33.889 --> 02:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
factors outcomes how do you change some
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
of those so so accountability so I think
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great I I think there's a lot
 
02:33:40.849 --> 02:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
of contributing a lot of factors that
 
02:33:43.130 --> 02:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
contribute to student outcomes but what
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
you can measure is student outcomes I
 
02:33:47.410 --> 02:33:47.420 align:start position:0%
mean this is this is
 
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
this is you know I'd call it a quality
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
control Loop and and you know at the at
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day what matters
 
02:34:02.809 --> 02:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
most is our student outcomes and and
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if a district is getting
 
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
strong student outcomes by um
 
02:34:10.969 --> 02:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh you know what what
 
02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
I mean uh uh uh the Hamilton School
 
02:34:17.450 --> 02:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
District may have a completely different
 
02:34:19.370 --> 02:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what we want to call it
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in this area faculty
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
profile then the Concord School District
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
or the bow School District but they
 
02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
don't have to be exactly the same as
 
02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
long as they're as long as the the
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
accountability part through student
 
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
outcomes is being met can we Define that
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
well currently in the bill it's defied
 
02:34:41.090 --> 02:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's defined I'm on page 10 down at line
 
02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:42.770 align:start position:0%
it's defined I'm on page 10 down at line
34.

02:34:42.770 --> 02:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
34.
 
02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
um uh and it's uh and it's
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
in in this case that is included but not
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
limited to performance on Statewide
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
assessment tests graduation rates and
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
attendance rates
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
and uh but but I I think you could have
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
dip you could have different
 
02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:00.530 align:start position:0%
dip you could have different
um

02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
um ways of measuring outcomes measuring
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
student outcomes based on student
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
performance uh doesn't have to be those
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I this was the data that we had so
 
02:35:13.490 --> 02:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
that we could evaluate it during the
 
02:35:17.330 --> 02:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
school funding commission work and um
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but it could be it could be others
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
um as well and uh but but what's what's
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
important about these three is that
 
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got the we've got these
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
data for every district for the last
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
decade and we're able to uh to look at
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
um how students performed uh in each
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
district based on their their uh their
 
02:35:45.650 --> 02:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
based on those District budgets and
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
we're able to to to to to look at the
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
different characteristics in each
 
02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
district and then determine a way of of
 
02:35:55.610 --> 02:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
predicting what a uh what a school
 
02:35:58.130 --> 02:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
district's budget would be to educate
 
02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
its students their students to a
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome
 
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:07.100 align:start position:0%
I think rep Sammy Porter than Turner
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner and anybody over here represent I
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's no way to really do
 
02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
this but one
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
um way of measuring and effectiveness of
 
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
an education is the future of the child
 
02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
or the or the student
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and we never talk about
 
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
what happened you know looking at the
 
02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:26.809 align:start position:0%
what happened you know looking at the
outcomes

02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
five years down the road from high
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
school graduation where are our
 
02:36:33.410 --> 02:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
graduates what are they doing you know
 
02:36:35.210 --> 02:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
what kind of Life are they living are
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
they contributing members of society or
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
have they landed up on the streets
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
um that's something that we really need
 
02:36:43.929 --> 02:36:43.939 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
and and evaluate but yet we don't have a
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
method in here at all I mean maybe this
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
isn't the aspect of it but it is an
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
important thing are our students going
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
out into the world and being civically
 
02:36:58.849 --> 02:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
engaged economically profit economically
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
surviving and having you know going on
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and being part of our general community
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
and our in our democracy those are the
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
things we need to be looking at but
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're always talking about standardized
 
02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
tests and graduation
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
um which doesn't give us a clue about
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
even some of these these schools where
 
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
we're talking about low performance and
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that if you looked at their
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
graduate level graduation you know their
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
students after graduation find they're
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the military they're out in the
 
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
workforce they married their families
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're working at the in their jobs
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're happy productive members of
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
society isn't that
 
02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
what we're after
 
02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
and to get back representative lad to
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
the to the reading that you did from
 
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
some book that you said
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
um talking about you had gotten from the
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it sounded to me
 
02:37:53.809 --> 02:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
very much like what was the basis for
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
the No Child Left Behind Act the schools
 
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
aren't doing their job we've got to
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
punish them
 
02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
and um it's time for the state to step
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
in and and do something well that's
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Federal Government
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
tried to do with No Child Left Behind
 
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
grading schools you're going to close
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
schools down they're going to fire all
 
02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
the teachers and hire hire new ones
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
because obviously they weren't doing
 
02:38:15.889 --> 02:38:15.899 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to be doing and
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
that misses the point of why the
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
performance is low and we keep skirting
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
around it because we don't want to
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
identify what the real issue is and the
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
real issue in my opinion is economics
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
and and we have to make sure that all
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
kids have an a fair chance from they're
 
02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
all starting at the same starting line
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're not all starting at the same
 
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
starting line you know what the kids
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
that have European vacations when
 
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
they're five years old are in a very
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
different place than the kids who are at
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
home with their mother or their
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
grandmother watching television until
 
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
they go to school so until we can
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
address that issue I don't think it's
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
fair for the state to say we're going to
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
go in and punish these schools you know
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
if a den just if someone goes to the
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
dentist and the dentist says you know
 
02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
brush your teeth you're going to get
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
cavities and they go home and they don't
 
02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
brush their teeth and they get cavities
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
is that the dentist's fault or is it the
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
fault of something else
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I just had to get that off my
 
02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be here much longer Mr
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I really have to get some
 
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
of these things off in my chest and this
 
02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
is one of them you know I'm sick and
 
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
tired of being blaming blaming blaming
 
02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
all the time on the school tour have
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in there working their hearts out
 
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
to do what's best for the kids and if
 
02:39:33.770 --> 02:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're not the kids are not achieving
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
to what some artificial level that we
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
say they should be achieving to those
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
teachers and those schools are made to
 
02:39:41.929 --> 02:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
feel like they're not very good there's
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
something wrong with them nobody wants
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
to be part of them and I I take
 
02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
exception to that because there I have
 
02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
never seen a teacher who didn't care
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.290 --> 02:39:56.300 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:39:59.870 --> 02:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
um I guess two things one would be that
 
02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:05.210 align:start position:0%
um I guess two things one would be that
I

02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
would like to see something in
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
accountability that actually measures
 
02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
growth over time that people don't get
 
02:40:14.690 --> 02:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know schools vary so much from year
 
02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
to year
 
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:17.050 align:start position:0%
to year
um

02:40:17.050 --> 02:40:17.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
what students they have what teachers
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
they have what
 
02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
um things that may happen in the local
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
community that makes quite a difference
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
on perhaps how they do on testing and
 
02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so I think something
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
has to like Dave said things have to be
 
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time I think the
 
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
accountability needs to be taken over a
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
long period well not as long maybe as 10
 
02:40:44.450 --> 02:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
years but a couple of years in a row or
 
02:40:46.849 --> 02:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
five years in a row my other thought is
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we have some schools in New
 
02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have made tremendous
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
turnarounds Parker Varney is one of them
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that I remember going to a a conference
 
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
02:41:02.929 --> 02:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
as as Mel said it started with
 
02:41:02.939 --> 02:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
as as Mel said it started with
leadership

02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
it also started with collaboration with
 
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
but that was the school that turned it
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
around Pittsfield for a while made a
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
turnaround but then then lost it because
 
02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
they couldn't sustain it I think it
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be important as part of this whole
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing to look at schools that have made
 
02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
a turnaround and what made the
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
difference and I'm I'm guessing that
 
02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are a few
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
things that we're missing totally
 
02:41:35.570 --> 02:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I worked in a school district where
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
we had so many people stay for so long
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
they had to offer us a bonus to leave
 
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.770 align:start position:0%
they had to offer us a bonus to leave
okay

02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so and why why did people stay so
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
long and why did the school do really
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
well well one of the things was that the
 
02:41:53.450 --> 02:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
The Faculty the the teachers were
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in all the decisions
 
02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the school we felt as though we were
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
were part of it we weren't it wasn't top
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
down management
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
um we had when we first started the
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
school we had a Department of Education
 
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
school we had a Department of Education
under

02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
under
um

02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh I forget his first name uh Marsden
 
02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
Who's Who Came Charlie Marston who came
 
02:42:18.590 --> 02:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know organized a group that came to
 
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
our school uh talked to us about
 
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh spotted things in the
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
community that um we needed to do in
 
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
order to get the community behind it
 
02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
because we were one of the first open
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
schools in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:33.230 align:start position:0%
schools in the state of New Hampshire
and

02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
um it was a radical change in how
 
02:42:37.730 --> 02:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
education was being
 
02:42:40.130 --> 02:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
um given and and what the school climate
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
was going to be like and the curriculum
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
itself so
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
um you know it was it was creative we
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
could we could actually do things as
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
teachers we were able to take the
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
standards that were given us and and be
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
creative in what we did and work to our
 
02:42:58.490 --> 02:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
strengths uh teach what people were
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
strong at uh English teachers were
 
02:43:03.050 --> 02:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
allowed to teach Shakespeare if that was
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
their strong point we've set so many
 
02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
regulations from the state down on what
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
happens in the classroom and what
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
happens in the schools people are
 
02:43:14.690 --> 02:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
handcuffed and it's and it's you know
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's really made it tough
 
02:43:19.969 --> 02:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
um to teach I mean that's that's why
 
02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
you're getting teachers leaving that's
 
02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
one of the big reasons you're getting
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
teachers leaving I I can't tell you how
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
many times I've talked to teachers I
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
know I've said it myself I just want
 
02:43:33.010 --> 02:43:33.020 align:start position:0%
politics out of my classroom
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and those people at the state level have
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
no idea what's going on down in the
 
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
school level I I said that and heard it
 
02:43:43.130 --> 02:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
and still hear it over and over again so
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
I think when we're talking about
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes and we're talking about schools
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I know we're at a 30 000 foot level
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
but we also have to look at the at the
 
02:43:56.270 --> 02:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
Five Mile level or the one mile level or
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the 50 Feet level of being in that
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
classroom and and helping our teachers
 
02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
and and feeling as though education is
 
02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
being supported
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
um in order for that to filter down to
 
02:44:11.809 --> 02:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
student outcomes because the magic
 
02:44:14.090 --> 02:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
happens between the teacher and the
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
student that's where the magic happens
 
02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative cordello you had your
 
02:44:20.929 --> 02:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah thank you
 
02:44:23.809 --> 02:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
um first uh I don't know that the state
 
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
is punishing
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
um any schools
 
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that are not performing
 
02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
um going back to Essa
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and the state plan for Essa
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and even before there are the lower
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
performing schools I think it's five and
 
02:44:41.929 --> 02:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
ten percent of the lowest performing
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
schools were referred to as uh
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
um CSI comprehensive support
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember the exact uh acronym
 
02:44:57.770 --> 02:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
but CSI and TSI schools and they did get
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
um according to the state plan
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
additional supports in terms of
 
02:45:03.849 --> 02:45:03.859 align:start position:0%
assistance and
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans and so forth and
 
02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
working with the Department to the
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
extent that that Improvement plan
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
um is in place today and and how much
 
02:45:18.050 --> 02:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
the level of those supports might have
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the original plan
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
so there are supports for those lower
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
performing schools
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the we can't say that
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
the state is punishing low performing
 
02:45:36.349 --> 02:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
schools I don't think that that is the
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
case at all
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to go over this year
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit representative Nelson you
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman of Life what a
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation and I wish I was
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
going to rain again just to be part of
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
all this
 
02:45:53.450 --> 02:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I see a little I agree with everybody
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
and what they say that's extremely
 
02:45:56.809 --> 02:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
important but I just jotted that a few
 
02:45:56.819 --> 02:45:59.090 align:start position:0%
important but I just jotted that a few
things

02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.050 --> 02:46:02.060 align:start position:0%
I always ask as a person both students
 
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
what they who is their best teacher in
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
high school when they're out and who was
 
02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
their least favorite their worst teacher
 
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to gather that
 
02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:13.790 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to gather that
information

02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
the other one is the very common is the
 
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
teacher teaches what they like
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
they make I've heard many times teachers
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
teach the Civil War and you're supposed
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
to do a whole bunch of stuff and they
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
spend three quarters of the Year
 
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
teaching the Civil War how you get
 
02:46:30.889 --> 02:46:30.899 align:start position:0%
involved and get that corrected that the
 
02:46:33.770 --> 02:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
teacher teaches the curriculum from one
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
end to the other rather than just what
 
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
they like oh two more things
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
um money doesn't save everything or
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
solve everything
 
02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't for any of us and it's great
 
02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
to have money but it doesn't
 
02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
and exit interviews would be one as I
 
02:46:53.809 --> 02:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
um let's see two other things
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
teachers don't always leave because of
 
02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
money it's a big factor I would agree a
 
02:47:05.570 --> 02:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
good percentage do many of them leave
 
02:47:07.130 --> 02:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
because they're not happy with the
 
02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:08.150 align:start position:0%
because they're not happy with the
school

02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
the administration
 
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know they're just things aren't
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
going right and they're just giving up
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
now throughout the time bomb on this
 
02:47:19.010 --> 02:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
whole thing or model explosion I think
 
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
I've been a union member my entire
 
02:47:23.450 --> 02:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
career two different unions and I
 
02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
support the unions sometimes they
 
02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
support teachers that aren't so good
 
02:47:31.309 --> 02:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
how do we resolve that without getting
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
the politics out or being anti-union to
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
move out the teachers that are not
 
02:47:39.410 --> 02:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
helping that's all I have to say
 
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
ditto representative Tanner said on
 
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
motivating on teacher and student is
 
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
where the magic happens
 
02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
and the regulations and the rules and
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff gets in the way of the
 
02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
teacher I know when I did my student
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
teaching I was so disgusted because I
 
02:48:10.130 --> 02:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
was doing math math you have to have all
 
02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
the pieces to move on to the next pieces
 
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I was given a and I loved my
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
students in my classes
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
who were missing a lot of pieces and I
 
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time picking up those
 
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
pieces but I had to be at the same place
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
the same day as everybody else but my
 
02:48:29.809 --> 02:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
students weren't the same as everybody
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
else and I worked my butt off to try to
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
get my students there and I can remember
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
begging can I have one more week
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
just one more week my kids are almost
 
02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:39.889 align:start position:0%
just one more week my kids are almost
there

02:48:39.889 --> 02:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
but no I couldn't I had to be at this
 
02:48:44.929 --> 02:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
place and I had to go on even though my
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
kids weren't there yet and I talked to
 
02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
other early you know Math teachers and
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
they were making the same complaints and
 
02:48:55.370 --> 02:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
they were like and and I just felt
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we kind of agreed that the system
 
02:48:59.690 --> 02:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
was set up for students and teachers to
 
02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:00.770 align:start position:0%
was set up for students and teachers to
fail

02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
fail
 
02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
that's what it felt like
 
02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:05.210 align:start position:0%
that's what it felt like
and

02:49:05.210 --> 02:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's something we need to be looking
 
02:49:09.530 --> 02:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
at it doesn't have to do with funding it
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
has to do with how are we doing the
 
02:49:14.290 --> 02:49:14.300 align:start position:0%
schools are we letting teachers teach
 
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
are we trying to treat every student
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
every kid every whatever exactly the
 
02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
same and March them along in this you
 
02:49:25.010 --> 02:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
must be here you must be here you must
 
02:49:27.889 --> 02:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
be here without taking any account of
 
02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
who the kids are what their background
 
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
is what they know just like Rhett Porter
 
02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
was saying we get kids are very very
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
different and they come from different
 
02:49:38.929 --> 02:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and they have different
 
02:49:42.290 --> 02:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses and that how do
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
we address that
 
02:49:49.070 --> 02:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
I was sitting over here and I whispered
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues sitting here the one
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
word I had not heard in this entire
 
02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.690 align:start position:0%
word I had not heard in this entire
discussion

02:50:05.690 --> 02:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
and it was qualitative
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
no one mentioned changing the quality of
 
02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
what we're doing we talked about how
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
many people we needed what kind of
 
02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
support numbers all that sort of thing
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
but if you absent qualitative
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
achievement from a discussion of Finance
 
02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
I can guarantee you you will not get
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
what you want in outcome it's just not
 
02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:35.630 align:start position:0%
what you want in outcome it's just not
possible

02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
we need to address that elephant in the
 
02:50:40.429 --> 02:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
room as well
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
we may not be preparing teachers
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
to do what we want them to do
 
02:50:50.210 --> 02:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
and we need to involve them in this
 
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussion too
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this discussion
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
needs to include the teacher preparation
 
02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
institutions as well
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
is all we're talking about here because
 
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
if we don't educate the communities for
 
02:51:09.290 --> 02:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
what to hire for
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
and then they in turn will by their
 
02:51:14.809 --> 02:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
hiring practices change the nature of
 
02:51:16.969 --> 02:51:16.979 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the teacher
 
02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
preparation process
 
02:51:20.929 --> 02:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
will never have the outcomes we're
 
02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:51:25.969 --> 02:51:25.979 align:start position:0%
it has to be a component
 
02:51:28.849 --> 02:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
just tell you one little factoid that
 
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
when you enlist in the Marine Corps you
 
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
finish High School
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine you wave your high school
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
diploma they sign you up
 
02:51:46.849 --> 02:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
the first thing they do is give you an
 
02:51:46.859 --> 02:51:49.429 align:start position:0%
the first thing they do is give you an
examination

02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
examination
 
02:51:51.290 --> 02:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
and you get a score I've forgotten what
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the test is called but I'll find out
 
02:51:55.309 --> 02:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
again and pass it on to you
 
02:51:58.250 --> 02:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
and that score determines what schools
 
02:52:00.530 --> 02:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
you get to go to what kind of training
 
02:52:04.130 --> 02:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
you have every single thing they do in
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
training a marine has an educational
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
theory substantiating it
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
down to the order of doing push-ups and
 
02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
pull-ups and all the physical stuff and
 
02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
when you do it
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
and how it comes out and how then you
 
02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
apply those skills that's all sequenced
 
02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think we do that much in our
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
public schools now not everybody is a
 
02:52:33.650 --> 02:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
concrete sequential learner or whatever
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's true we like all get along together
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to be teaching
 
02:52:38.819 --> 02:52:40.550 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to be teaching
smarter

02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
smarter
 
02:52:42.889 --> 02:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
and I think we're not letting or
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
enabling that to happen as we keep
 
02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
talking about with the blind teachers
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
and not requiring those others who
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
aren't teaching that well the maybe this
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
is not the feel for you
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
enough said I think this group's
 
02:53:02.650 --> 02:53:02.660 align:start position:0%
abstract random
 
02:53:05.290 --> 02:53:05.300 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:53:07.309 --> 02:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
represent Luna
 
02:53:11.389 --> 02:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
so so thanks Rick all right just uh just
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question oh wait wait what
 
02:53:16.130 --> 02:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so I want to take I
 
02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
want to take a couple of school
 
02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:18.650 align:start position:0%
want to take a couple of school
districts

02:53:18.650 --> 02:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:53:21.130 --> 02:53:21.140 align:start position:0%
um Hopkinton where I live
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
um 15 minutes from here and
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think our average student in
 
02:53:29.570 --> 02:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hopkins I'm not looking at it right now
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
but it you know somehow I I think the
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
average student at Hopkinton performs at
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
about the 84th 85th percentile State
 
02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
Line you go up the road a half hour from
 
02:53:42.410 --> 02:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton to Newport and the average
 
02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
student in Newport performs
 
02:53:47.330 --> 02:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
um at about the fourth percentile
 
02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:49.429 align:start position:0%
um at about the fourth percentile
Statewide

02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
02:53:53.210 --> 02:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand how
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and and honestly I think I think all
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
mo I think a lot of our discussion has
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
been about quality because when we're
 
02:54:02.809 --> 02:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
talking about student outcomes that's a
 
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
quality assessment of of of how students
 
02:54:08.750 --> 02:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
are performing we can disagree on you
 
02:54:10.730 --> 02:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
know you know the the specific
 
02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
assessments but it is a quality
 
02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:13.370 align:start position:0%
assessments but it is a quality
assessment

02:54:13.370 --> 02:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:54:17.090 --> 02:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
but but how do you explain uh based on
 
02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the difference in in in in
 
02:54:23.530 --> 02:54:23.540 align:start position:0%
in in
 
02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
outcomes from Hopkinton and then going a
 
02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
half hour up the road and and half hours
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm putting that out there is
 
02:54:35.690 --> 02:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's not three hours up the road it's
 
02:54:38.210 --> 02:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
not five hours up the road it's a half
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
hour up the road
 
02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:40.730 align:start position:0%
hour up the road
um

02:54:40.730 --> 02:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
um are they
 
02:54:46.429 --> 02:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
are they hiring the wrong teachers not
 
02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
enough teachers too many teachers
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
teachers that aren't
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
I I mean teaching that are teaching
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
something different what what what are
 
02:54:57.889 --> 02:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
you what do you attribute based on what
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
you what you just said to that such a
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
stark difference between student
 
02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
outcomes in districts that are only a
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:09.359 --> 02:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
in the co-mingle ballots is it required
 
02:55:16.610 --> 02:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
to call co-mingle ballots where multiple
 
02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
towns send somebody to school
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
mingle Bells where they will count put
 
02:55:24.889 --> 02:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
all the towns into together and then
 
02:55:27.889 --> 02:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
they count the ballots without knowing
 
02:55:30.889 --> 02:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
how each Town voted when I was in
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont and we're going back a long time
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
ago they used to co-mingle them so we
 
02:55:37.730 --> 02:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
never knew what our local school or town
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
how they felt about the school because
 
02:55:42.410 --> 02:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
the number would be 1 000 or whatever
 
02:55:45.170 --> 02:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
and we had a small school we never knew
 
02:55:46.969 --> 02:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
how they felt
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
as a town for their elementary school
 
02:55:51.230 --> 02:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't know what they do here in
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
no no they don't co-mingle
 
02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:59.210 align:start position:0%
no no they don't co-mingle
okay

02:55:59.210 --> 02:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:56:04.969 --> 02:56:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I I love the discussion that we're
 
02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
having today and I feel like it's
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
probably the most productive discussion
 
02:56:12.769 --> 02:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
I've sat in on over the past two years
 
02:56:14.929 --> 02:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
so I just want to start by saying it
 
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
makes me really happy
 
02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:17.630 align:start position:0%
makes me really happy
um

02:56:17.630 --> 02:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
I agree with something that just about
 
02:56:22.490 --> 02:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
everybody here has said and I keep going
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
back to the money where we talk about we
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
talked about this before putting more
 
02:56:29.809 --> 02:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
money into the schools I do feel like
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's deeper and I don't know how to
 
02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
fix it but I don't know if it's
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
something you need to look at maybe more
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the before or the after school
 
02:56:38.809 --> 02:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
programs we're saying that it's
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
something that has to do with the home
 
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
life versus what's happening during the
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
school day I'm wondering if we can take
 
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
a deeper dive into the social economic
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
aspects of things and try to figure out
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
how to help these kiddos that way I
 
02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's too big for us here
 
02:56:56.210 --> 02:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
but but this is what's been weighing on
 
02:56:58.370 --> 02:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
me for for quite a while
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question that I
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
have for you
 
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:57:05.210 --> 02:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
um kind of the bandwidth or how much
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
money these schools have right to
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
support their students we talk about
 
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
let's say a Hopkinton versus a Newport
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
right the state is giving a certain
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
amount and we're saying what these
 
02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
communities can or cannot afford on
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
their own but what determines that it my
 
02:57:23.870 --> 02:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
my perception has been it's um the
 
02:57:25.730 --> 02:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
tolerance of the community for lack of a
 
02:57:28.010 --> 02:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
better word right their threshold or
 
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
their tolerance because the money that's
 
02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
being spent on these budgets is being
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
put forth by the administrators or the
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
school board but the final amount is
 
02:57:38.750 --> 02:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
being determined at delivery Obsession
 
02:57:42.590 --> 02:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
and or on Election Day is that a fair
 
02:57:45.769 --> 02:57:45.779 align:start position:0%
assessment of what the towns across the
 
02:57:48.290 --> 02:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
state can afford or is it what those
 
02:57:50.450 --> 02:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
voters are choosing to put toward
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
education I don't know the answer to
 
02:57:54.290 --> 02:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
that it's just a thought I've had while
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
we were discussing this thank you
 
02:57:58.849 --> 02:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
boy that's got a lot of questions in it
 
02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
and what you're asking us I I'll I'll
 
02:58:04.190 --> 02:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
try to address a situation which
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
happened in this state
 
02:58:08.450 --> 02:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
years ago White Mountain Community
 
02:58:11.690 --> 02:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
College had an academic center in my
 
02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:13.550 align:start position:0%
College had an academic center in my
community

02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it got to the point where White
 
02:58:20.690 --> 02:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
Mountain could no longer afford to
 
02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
Supply staff for that academic center
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
which was part of White Mountain
 
02:58:26.330 --> 02:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
Community College
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
simply because there was not an enough
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
students participating in the program
 
02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
within the community
 
02:58:36.769 --> 02:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
Ray Burton and I worked like the devil
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
to try to keep that Center there
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
and worked with the superintendent of
 
02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
schools and he was very interested but
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
when I got beyond that level in the
 
02:58:49.319 --> 02:58:50.450 align:start position:0%
when I got beyond that level in the
schools

02:58:50.450 --> 02:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
the principal did not engage
 
02:58:57.650 --> 02:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
and the community as a result who worked
 
02:59:00.590 --> 02:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
with that principal did not engage and
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a long time people are thinking well
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
it's how this community aspires to
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
education the aspiration of what my
 
02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
child's going to be when they leave
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
school they said well they're they're
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
not going to need college they're going
 
02:59:15.769 --> 02:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
to go off and work in the woods or
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
they're going to become diesel mechanics
 
02:59:18.969 --> 02:59:18.979 align:start position:0%
over queer tech center or they're gonna
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
that type of skill orientation which now
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
I wish a lot more would do because you
 
02:59:25.849 --> 02:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
could probably get more money in those
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
skills than you can and some of the
 
02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
things coming out of college with but at
 
02:59:32.690 --> 02:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
any rate we lost our Academic Center
 
02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I equate that loss not necessarily
 
02:59:37.969 --> 02:59:37.979 align:start position:0%
to what we tried as a legislature we
 
02:59:40.250 --> 02:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
tried like the devil we worked with um
 
02:59:43.130 --> 02:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
with the the chair of the State Board of
 
02:59:45.769 --> 02:59:45.779 align:start position:0%
Education uh we worked with the
 
02:59:47.570 --> 02:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
community college system we worked with
 
02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
the trustees and Ray Burton was the
 
02:59:52.910 --> 02:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
person back in those days and he
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't make any Headway either
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
it was I think a result of leadership in
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
that particular facility that they
 
03:00:03.410 --> 03:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
didn't take advantage of the academic
 
03:00:06.050 --> 03:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
program that was there there is a lot of
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
things that the the organization the
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
trans and she had staff and all there we
 
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
just didn't have support locally in the
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
schools and so the quality of your staff
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
and the quality of the staff in the in
 
03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
the way that staff works with the
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
community is very important but I also
 
03:00:25.670 --> 03:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
say to all of us here that there is a
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
need for this data that and
 
03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making is all oftentimes driven
 
03:00:34.450 --> 03:00:34.460 align:start position:0%
by data that's a reality of our society
 
03:00:36.590 --> 03:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
anytime we go to the legislature we're
 
03:00:38.210 --> 03:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
going to ask for more money for
 
03:00:40.309 --> 03:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to say show me show
 
03:00:43.490 --> 03:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
me your your sound data that justify
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
that increase or wherever you're going
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
and when we I I worked the other day
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
with the folks over in the data
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
processing of doe with Caitlin Davis and
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
and and Nate Nate green who is in charge
 
03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
of research and the assessment
 
03:01:02.929 --> 03:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
Improvement performance program
 
03:01:06.050 --> 03:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
and I my question initially to them was
 
03:01:09.650 --> 03:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
what are we doing we have we know that
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
many of students coming back to school
 
03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
are five months if not more behind the
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
mathematics same thing basically in
 
03:01:17.929 --> 03:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
Reading as well as a result of this
 
03:01:17.939 --> 03:01:19.929 align:start position:0%
Reading as well as a result of this
pandemic

03:01:19.929 --> 03:01:19.939 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics is not necessarily just
 
03:01:23.570 --> 03:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
related to the pandemic we've always
 
03:01:25.969 --> 03:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
been kind of slippery in that area over
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
the years here there's been a waterfall
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
effect when the kids hit the middle
 
03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
school and when they get to the high
 
03:01:32.450 --> 03:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
school they were not performing the way
 
03:01:34.130 --> 03:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
they should and that's why we had
 
03:01:35.630 --> 03:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
remediation at the community college
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
level 60 percent of the kids had to have
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
remediation which 50 never got an
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
associate's degree that's a problem
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I asked what are we doing with these
 
03:01:47.210 --> 03:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
assessment results at the department we
 
03:01:49.969 --> 03:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
get the scores posted to us they're on
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
the web immediately upon taking that
 
03:01:54.769 --> 03:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
test but are you doing the Deep dive
 
03:01:56.570 --> 03:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
some districts are just throwing out
 
03:01:58.250 --> 03:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
their whole math program starting over
 
03:02:01.969 --> 03:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
with scratch or can you tell me what
 
03:02:04.010 --> 03:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
specific areas within mathematics
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum were weak in
 
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
well we don't we don't do an analysis of
 
03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
that test that deep down and we want to
 
03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the Personnel to do
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
that I heard the analysis uh spoken to
 
03:02:20.809 --> 03:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
earlier that there is a bill in there
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
now to provide the department the staff
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
to to do that deep dive and
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
Analysis of our math results maybe it's
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
enumeration maybe it's Sumerian geometry
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
maybe it's this or that we don't know
 
03:02:36.769 --> 03:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
and the schools don't have the staff to
 
03:02:38.929 --> 03:02:38.939 align:start position:0%
do this either they're they they take
 
03:02:40.370 --> 03:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
those results they use them they share
 
03:02:44.090 --> 03:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
with parents and they they they look at
 
03:02:45.889 --> 03:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
them and oftentimes they make that quick
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
decision well we got to do something
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
about this curriculum we're going to
 
03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
rewrite the whole darn thing maybe
 
03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary so
 
03:02:54.769 --> 03:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
um I I think part of the issue is we've
 
03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
looked at the quality of you know the
 
03:03:01.130 --> 03:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
staff there in in the schools but also I
 
03:03:03.290 --> 03:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
look at the the staff we have at
 
03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
department of education do we have the
 
03:03:09.230 --> 03:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
support there from doe in those
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum areas we once had those
 
03:03:13.610 --> 03:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
curriculum coordinators and staff for do
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have the data analysis going over
 
03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
there which is looking at the research
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the the content that we're using to
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
are we speaking to how to really improve
 
03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
are we just you know doing you know more
 
03:03:29.150 --> 03:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the same old same old
 
03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I believe we're not doing an analysis
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
the way we should and that's why I will
 
03:03:36.469 --> 03:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
support an analysis position over there
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
too do that deep dive with school
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
districts and share that so when I'm
 
03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
developing Chris curriculum at the which
 
03:03:44.990 --> 03:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
is my responsibility at the local level
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm doing a revision of curriculum
 
03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's in line with what the state
 
03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
standards are
 
03:03:53.870 --> 03:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
and so we've had this I think a golf
 
03:03:56.750 --> 03:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
between doe and and and what's happening
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
in the schools
 
03:04:00.050 --> 03:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's intentional I
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
think it's lack of Staffing eighty
 
03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
percent of the staff over there are
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
federally funded employees
 
03:04:08.030 --> 03:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at title one looking at this
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
looking at that but they're not doing
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
what we need to have done and so we're
 
03:04:14.570 --> 03:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
not funding that right
 
03:04:17.570 --> 03:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
either so we look at trying to change
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in in in their funding
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
of adequacy we need to look
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
farther afield to find out how we're
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
going to support the schools and I don't
 
03:04:30.290 --> 03:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
think we're doing an adequate job as a
 
03:04:33.170 --> 03:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
state because local control you have
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
instruction you have curriculum so we're
 
03:04:37.250 --> 03:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
out of that game
 
03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:40.330 align:start position:0%
out of that game
representative

03:04:40.330 --> 03:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:44.450 --> 03:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
speaking of uh assessment I've been
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
thinking about this a bunch and I think
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
you really have to follow individual
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
students and how they're doing and
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
whether they're improving
 
03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
in their areas and not take an average
 
03:04:59.330 --> 03:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
of a class you know anybody who's been
 
03:05:01.849 --> 03:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
in a school knows that different classes
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
have different cultures different
 
03:05:06.349 --> 03:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
abilities that you know you can you can
 
03:05:08.210 --> 03:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
have one class that that are very
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
studious in the next class that like to
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
goof around and it seems you know and
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
you see that right
 
03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
so comparing that way is not going to
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
work but we have the ability every kid
 
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
takes these tests we have the results
 
03:05:27.769 --> 03:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
I think we need to be tracking it need
 
03:05:29.150 --> 03:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:30.530 align:start position:0%
to be
um

03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
looking to see is each student improving
 
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
is that student improving and we have
 
03:05:38.450 --> 03:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that now with this
 
03:05:40.490 --> 03:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
position I think it's coming in I think
 
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
some schools are doing this I think
 
03:05:45.050 --> 03:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
they're tracking the core heart if
 
03:05:48.769 --> 03:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
you're a third grader in 2006 seven year
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
fourth grader fifth grade or sixth
 
03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
grader they're following a cohort but
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're also looking at individual
 
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
students yeah and that's being done
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's the best practice but when I
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
spoke with Nate green the other day over
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
at Doe
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
they are just starting to do this and we
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
will have a legislative oversight
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee on September 27th when they're
 
03:06:12.349 --> 03:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
going to come in and present that
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
information to us and they're going to
 
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
do it by cohort by grade levels kids
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
following that seeing where exactly
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
things are going Askew but that's that's
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
beyond where you're you're talking about
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the individual I'm talking now about
 
03:06:29.809 --> 03:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
State and hopefully individual school
 
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
districts and we don't have that data
 
03:06:33.889 --> 03:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
yet but we have the state we'll be
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
looking at those courts those seats will
 
03:06:38.210 --> 03:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
be handed out then with the recent
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes president Woodcock thank you um you
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
know I I have several comments about I
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
will try to put them back down I want to
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
go back to what uh Tana said uh the
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
quality of instruction uh is the
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
difference in that classroom when you
 
03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
shut that door and all the factors of
 
03:07:03.170 --> 03:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
going to the teacher training teacher
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
professional development pay attrition
 
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
all those things and the other one we
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned is a student we're the
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
students out developmentally uh where
 
03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
are they and the better instructing
 
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
instruction you have those teachers can
 
03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
identify within that classroom setting
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
where each other needs to work but they
 
03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
have to have the toolbox to bring each
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
chunker along the answer is in the
 
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
classroom initially so I think that's
 
03:07:30.889 --> 03:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
that's the key we've we've forgotten
 
03:07:33.530 --> 03:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
about because that helps terrifically
 
03:07:36.170 --> 03:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
the other part is just reflecting on uh
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about the scores and we do
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
test item analysis we do we can identify
 
03:07:42.769 --> 03:07:42.779 align:start position:0%
right down to what particular
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
fundamental masculine and where they
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
lost it where they missed it they're
 
03:07:48.050 --> 03:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
looking at class what's and what teacher
 
03:07:49.490 --> 03:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
at indoor did do it
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
um so that that can be done but I would
 
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
agree that the doe has not been on the
 
03:07:59.570 --> 03:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
ball uh because they spent too much down
 
03:08:01.730 --> 03:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
time or the last four or five years you
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
talk about a principal of school or
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
administrative School District with the
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
same thing with the commissioner of
 
03:08:07.490 --> 03:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
Education he's out there create a whole
 
03:08:09.769 --> 03:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
lot more programs just to think we took
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
all the time and invested our money and
 
03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
put public education first
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
so it goes right across the board I mean
 
03:08:17.450 --> 03:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
we as a state a commission a
 
03:08:19.730 --> 03:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner and doe has not invested
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
all their funds into looking at how to
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
make these things better uh along the
 
03:08:25.849 --> 03:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
way we'll talk about schools and
 
03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
teachers administrators so it's not it's
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
not just uh that point but clearly the
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
quality instruction in the classroom is
 
03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
the fundamental priest that makes uh
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
schools succeed and makes kids succeed
 
03:08:41.210 --> 03:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
now just to follow up on that you know
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
when I came in here in the house I
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to see these so-called curriculum
 
03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:46.969 align:start position:0%
wanted to see these so-called curriculum
Frameworks

03:08:46.969 --> 03:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
Frameworks
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
which are guidelines which don't exist
 
03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
going they were gone way back when
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
they've been gone for we we of course we
 
03:08:57.530 --> 03:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
no longer have in statute because they
 
03:08:59.570 --> 03:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
weren't doing them but if I wanted to
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
find out what the fiscal education
 
03:09:02.809 --> 03:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
curriculum was for this state I'd have
 
03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
to go back to what 2004 and and and so
 
03:09:10.510 --> 03:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we have standards which are in
 
03:09:15.130 --> 03:09:15.140 align:start position:0%
ed306 but that's that's not what we need
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not this
 
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fault no that's that's
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
the but that's illusion that's been
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
going on in the Department of Education
 
03:09:26.330 --> 03:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
in this state I was very surprised when
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
I moved to this state
 
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I went to the department to try to
 
03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
get all this curriculum information
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
my school district where I was before I
 
03:09:39.650 --> 03:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
had more staff than this doe has
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
and and we had that we all our
 
03:09:45.230 --> 03:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum CRT curriculum reference
 
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
tests for each area we wrote those
 
03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:48.650 align:start position:0%
tests for each area we wrote those
ourselves

03:09:48.650 --> 03:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that if we want to
 
03:09:53.809 --> 03:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
see Improvement we're going to have to
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
have Improvement Beyond just this
 
03:09:58.370 --> 03:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
funding formula which I concur we need
 
03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
to change this around we need more
 
03:10:02.809 --> 03:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
accountability within it and we probably
 
03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
need to I don't know if we need to throw
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
if twenty thousand dollars per student
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money per student now
 
03:10:11.630 --> 03:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
granted it's not State money it's
 
03:10:13.969 --> 03:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
property tax money as well local money
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
but we need to reorient I think where
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the dollars might be used more
 
03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
effectively it's not always more money
 
03:10:24.050 --> 03:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's how effective we're using our
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
current money
 
03:10:27.769 --> 03:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
and that is a question that we need to
 
03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
address when we're looking at this
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
costing formula how effective is the
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
current Formula being used that money
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I we've tried to address that would
 
03:10:40.250 --> 03:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
swap a little bit but I think that's a
 
03:10:41.809 --> 03:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
component that this group right here we
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
got to discuss that before we do
 
03:10:45.230 --> 03:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
anything this year I agree with that as
 
03:10:47.330 --> 03:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
well representative lab but all
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
districts don't have that pot of money
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
because they don't have that money
 
03:10:55.370 --> 03:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's what this program is 1680 at
 
03:10:57.170 --> 03:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
least not to develop so there is a part
 
03:10:58.610 --> 03:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
of mind that everybody has an equal shot
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct if we don't
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
have the money to work with it doesn't
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
matter because you can't get what you
 
03:11:05.450 --> 03:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
need done
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty tough when you have 196
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
districts so how many have we ever had
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
in this state you know for everybody to
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
be replicating what everybody else is
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
doing there's that's not effective use
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the coin representative and then
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh cordelli thanks very
 
03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
much Rick
 
03:11:25.969 --> 03:11:25.979 align:start position:0%
um uh just just uh um I just wanted to
 
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
talk to a couple of points that that
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
were just made by you and actually and
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
represent Litchfield as well but um but
 
03:11:37.849 --> 03:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um that that 1680
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
does uh based on the um the school
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
funding commission work is and this is a
 
03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
really important part when when looking
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
at what it cost what it would cost a
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
district to educated students to a
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome it um it looks at um
 
03:11:57.530 --> 03:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
it first of all it gets away
 
03:11:59.450 --> 03:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies because that's one of the
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
things about looking at all state all
 
03:12:05.090 --> 03:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
School District budgets over over a
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
decade in student outcomes they were
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
able to identify inefficiencies in in
 
03:12:13.610 --> 03:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
school budgets and then and then look at
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
a way to to develop School budgets based
 
03:12:19.730 --> 03:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
on achieving
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um those those outcomes so so you could
 
03:12:25.010 --> 03:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
look at at for instance
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and I'll pick the two examples that
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
that Melissa and I used uh Newport and
 
03:12:31.849 --> 03:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton you could look at the number
 
03:12:34.429 --> 03:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
of students that that live in low-income
 
03:12:36.170 --> 03:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
households number that are special
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
education the different factors that we
 
03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
that we do look at the end the student
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes in there and then look at how
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
those budgets were built and what they
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
were you know what their spending
 
03:12:48.889 --> 03:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
categories were and and essentially be
 
03:12:50.809 --> 03:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
able to Baseline them
 
03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
so that now if I know that a school
 
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
district has a you know a certain you
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
know a higher or a lower number of
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
special education students or higher or
 
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
lower number of students that live in
 
03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
that come from low income uh backgrounds
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
how much it would cost for the for those
 
03:13:12.170 --> 03:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
districts to um to uh to deliver an
 
03:13:14.389 --> 03:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
adequate education based on you know
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
students achieving a Statewide average
 
03:13:20.929 --> 03:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
so so so to your to your point Rick
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
um the a large part of this work was to
 
03:13:26.570 --> 03:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
identify the inefficiencies but more
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
importantly identify the efficiencies
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
that lead to student outcomes and um and
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
how that reflects across districts with
 
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
different student characteristics
 
03:13:40.730 --> 03:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
um the um the other uh Point um that I
 
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
think representative Litchfield was was
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
talking about and this is and
 
03:13:46.130 --> 03:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock uh mentioned it
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
uh as well
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
um at what point do you look at a
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
District's access to resources and say
 
03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's all we're going to spend I don't
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
want to spend a dime more fourth
 
03:14:00.769 --> 03:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
percentile is good enough for us versus
 
03:14:04.250 --> 03:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just tapped out there's not a dime
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
more that I can spend to to on our
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
school district and we still can't raise
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
you know the money for an adequate
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
budget so that I can get an adequate uh
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
student outcome and um when you take a
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
look at Hopkinton yep we're near the top
 
03:14:23.630 --> 03:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the state in terms of how much we're
 
03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
in the state in terms of how much we're
spending

03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
spending
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
um on our on our tax rate
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and um you know we got some unique
 
03:14:32.510 --> 03:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
things in our community I think it it it
 
03:14:34.969 --> 03:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
it definitely has a has a diverse
 
03:14:37.969 --> 03:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic mix but uh and this is a
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
stressful time and it's been 12 years in
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
front of taxpayers Janet Bennett all
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
those meetings and uh and it's and it's
 
03:14:49.969 --> 03:14:49.979 align:start position:0%
you know pretty stressful because you've
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people with with
 
03:14:54.290 --> 03:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
substantial means that that you know
 
03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
nobody he likes paying property taxes
 
03:14:58.849 --> 03:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
but you know we want we want to have
 
03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
great schools so so we raise the we
 
03:15:04.010 --> 03:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
raise the money and I think you know we
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
passed more budgets than than we lose in
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
um in Hopkinton but then you go half
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
half hour up the road to uh to Newport
 
03:15:14.450 --> 03:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
guess what they're paying nearly the
 
03:15:16.490 --> 03:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
same tax rate as what we're paying in
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and uh and they can't even
 
03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:20.090 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and uh and they can't even
fund

03:15:20.090 --> 03:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:15:23.690 --> 03:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
on a per on a per student basis you know
 
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh 70 of the budget that we're that
 
03:15:28.370 --> 03:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
we're funding in Hopkinton they're
 
03:15:29.870 --> 03:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
topped out
 
03:15:33.469 --> 03:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
they're just tapped out and and I think
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's really what what you know
 
03:15:38.450 --> 03:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think it goes It goes to what
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
Steve was saying you know in terms of
 
03:15:43.969 --> 03:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
where you know how does how can the
 
03:15:43.979 --> 03:15:44.929 align:start position:0%
where you know how does how can the
state

03:15:44.929 --> 03:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
use its precious limited resources
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that that that students
 
03:15:54.110 --> 03:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
aren't paying the price when taxpayers
 
03:15:58.250 --> 03:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
get tapped out and um uh and finally
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's what they're doing and actually
 
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be breaking new ground in
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
this area because Massachusetts does it
 
03:16:05.809 --> 03:16:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh they've been on the road to their
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Chapter 70 plan
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
um which um which recognizes it that
 
03:16:14.889 --> 03:16:14.899 align:start position:0%
that you know what the um the the the
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in in in Lawrence shouldn't be
 
03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:20.690 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in in in Lawrence shouldn't be
working

03:16:20.690 --> 03:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
six times harder than the taxpayers in
 
03:16:29.690 --> 03:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
in Wellesley and getting you know poor
 
03:16:31.250 --> 03:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
student outcomes because they they can't
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
even put to get fund the budget that
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
they should that they that they need uh
 
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
to be competitive in a in a you know in
 
03:16:41.090 --> 03:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
a global market global economy and um
 
03:16:45.170 --> 03:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
and so uh so you know so big points and
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I and I think Melissa was right on
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
when asking that question you know how
 
03:16:52.370 --> 03:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
do we know how do we know well you can
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
take a look at the student outcomes and
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at the tax rates in
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of these communities they're
 
03:17:01.190 --> 03:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
trying super hard
 
03:17:02.929 --> 03:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
they just can't get them
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
and we're trying super hard in Hopkinton
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
too but we do get there
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but um but you know that's we
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
obviously we have we have a very
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
socio-economically diverse demographic
 
03:17:19.849 --> 03:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
across our state as well and um and and
 
03:17:21.650 --> 03:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
you know if the state is going to take
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
its obligation
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
to uh assuring that every student has an
 
03:17:29.809 --> 03:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to an adequate education uh
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
then um then and take that seriously and
 
03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
I do believe the state takes it
 
03:17:36.410 --> 03:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
seriously you just take a look at what
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're spending right now you know
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
billion dollars a year that's you know
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
as far as general fund slash education
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund I mean that's the biggest
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
pile of of that's the biggest expense
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
our state has and certainly when you
 
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
take a look at all in with the local
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
which is about double that it's about
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
another two billion dollars all in where
 
03:18:01.309 --> 03:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
three billion dollar on public schools
 
03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an it's an enormous price
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
tag we get a lot
 
03:18:08.690 --> 03:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
for the state's Collective
 
03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
three billion dollars
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
top five
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know student outcomes nationally
 
03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
but not every District's getting that
 
03:18:20.210 --> 03:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
and um and and that's why you know I I
 
03:18:25.130 --> 03:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
think 1680 looks to looks to provide a
 
03:18:26.990 --> 03:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of fairness actually a lot of
 
03:18:30.170 --> 03:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
fairness into uh making sure that that
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
that the kids up in Newport
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
um you know get a fair Shake too I mean
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
I've spent I've spent a dozen years on
 
03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
the board making sure that that the kids
 
03:18:42.290 --> 03:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
in Hopkinton get a fair shake and as a
 
03:18:44.809 --> 03:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
taxpayer a lifetime taxpayer in
 
03:18:46.969 --> 03:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton making sure that our kids get
 
03:18:50.090 --> 03:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
up get a fair Shake but uh but Newport
 
03:18:52.010 --> 03:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
needs some help too Pittsfield needs
 
03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
some help too so many other places
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
Jefferson cordelli yeah thank you I just
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
have to go back to some prior comments
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
and disagree and um and that I think
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner and the department
 
03:19:10.010 --> 03:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
have done a fantastic job in programming
 
03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
to help students
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
um you have YES scholarship programs you
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
have summer scholarship programs for
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
students you have reading training for
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
teachers and adults free tutoring
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
available I think that
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
they've done a marvelous job
 
03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
um sometimes maybe getting the word out
 
03:19:33.410 --> 03:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
to parents and others about
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
um availability of these programs is an
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
issue that we could do better at but I
 
03:19:41.570 --> 03:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
think that they've done a great job in
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
trying to help students and recover the
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
learning loss from the pandemic
 
03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and then
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lexus I think we have to
 
03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
realize too that it's a vicious cycle
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
um public schools are kind of a keystone
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
of a community and I live in Sunapee and
 
03:20:03.769 --> 03:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
10 minutes down the road is Newport
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
and Sunapee is rated even higher than
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hoppington I think and we spend more
 
03:20:11.809 --> 03:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
money and I my taxes are a lot lower
 
03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
than Newports okay
 
03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:15.170 align:start position:0%
than Newports okay
um

03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:18.290 --> 03:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
but Newport uh because it's so close and
 
03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
because it is a town I represent until
 
03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:22.429 align:start position:0%
because it is a town I represent until
December

03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
December
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
um it's a vicious cycle for them okay
 
03:20:27.650 --> 03:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
the schools aren't doing well they can't
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
afford the what's happening there
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the people they hire at the
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
administrative level or at the business
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
administrator you talk about how many
 
03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
different superintendents Claremont had
 
03:20:41.889 --> 03:20:41.899 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how many business
 
03:20:43.849 --> 03:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
administrators different ones they've
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
had at Newport the new ones come in
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't know the system they don't know
 
03:20:49.969 --> 03:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
how to get grants they don't know how to
 
03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
effectively use the money
 
03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so the school is you know it's it's a
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
vicious cycle within the school the
 
03:20:58.250 --> 03:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
teachers leave because they aren't
 
03:21:01.130 --> 03:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
getting paid this the townspeople are
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
upset with the school so they're
 
03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
constantly on their backs it's you know
 
03:21:07.969 --> 03:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
to go to a school board meeting is is a
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
difficult thing because people are
 
03:21:12.410 --> 03:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
yelling at each other versus some other
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
school districts care Sarge for example
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
where people are very calm and very
 
03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
supportive of the school but it also
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
affects the community
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the community can't get businesses there
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
um they have one major business rugers
 
03:21:31.010 --> 03:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
and if that goes boy they're going to be
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
some hurting so they have to be very
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
careful how they deal with rugers
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um the school district
 
03:21:39.769 --> 03:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
that the kids coming out of the school
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
district there's been some that have
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
gone on to really great colleges Harvard
 
03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:45.710 align:start position:0%
gone on to really great colleges Harvard
Dartmouth

03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
um you know done well at UNH that sort
 
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
of thing but a number of them have gone
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
on to those colleges and they they can't
 
03:21:56.210 --> 03:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
take it because they're they're coming
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
from that kind of community and they
 
03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
don't have the the support at home they
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the support with the
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
community and they have the skills but
 
03:22:07.610 --> 03:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
they just can't they can't deal with uh
 
03:22:09.950 --> 03:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
what's before them and oftentimes they
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
drop out of college and they come back
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then they have student loans so
 
03:22:17.690 --> 03:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is so important not
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
only for the kids of New Hampshire and
 
03:22:22.070 --> 03:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
the students of New Hampshire but it's
 
03:22:24.530 --> 03:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
important to all the communities in New
 
03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire particularly the ones like
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin Newport Manchester because it's
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
making a difference in their economic
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
ability it's making a difference in
 
03:22:36.230 --> 03:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
their daily lives it's making a
 
03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
difference in what opportunities the
 
03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
kids have have there and how that
 
03:22:42.910 --> 03:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
Community thrives throughout
 
03:22:46.130 --> 03:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
and we're not just we're not just
 
03:22:48.050 --> 03:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
educating for soldiers to make everybody
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know into a little soldier that that
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
has the same basis we're not educating
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
kids necessarily to be workers we're
 
03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
educating them as Marjorie said
 
03:23:01.070 --> 03:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
for the for a human being for a
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
productive member of society and that
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
might mean an artist or it might mean a
 
03:23:07.969 --> 03:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
musician or it might mean an engineer or
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
it might mean somebody going into the
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
Marines okay but it means everybody it
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
can't be just the qualitative things
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
can't be so tight that we're losing
 
03:23:20.410 --> 03:23:20.420 align:start position:0%
sight of the whole child and
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive school education
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
thanks Rick let me get back to the 30
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
000 foot here for a second
 
03:23:37.729 --> 03:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
then there is a threshold question here
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
that school funding needs to address
 
03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
and that is a thing that I've said all
 
03:23:45.650 --> 03:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
along and that is
 
03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
are we going to are we concerned about
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
03:23:52.490 --> 03:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.889 --> 03:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
the issue of our kids
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
looks at all kids around all students I
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
hate that term kids all students across
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
and if you're worried about developing a
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
a Workforce
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
we can't just be worried about the
 
03:24:14.210 --> 03:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
students in Hopkinton
 
03:24:18.170 --> 03:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
more isolated students in Bedford or in
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
Newport we need to begin to look at what
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity for all of our kids
 
03:24:26.210 --> 03:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
because if I'm going to come in if I'm a
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
business person I want to start a
 
03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:29.090 align:start position:0%
business person I want to start a
business

03:24:29.090 --> 03:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
I I'm not looking at just one Community
 
03:24:32.929 --> 03:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to be gathering
 
03:24:35.809 --> 03:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
students and workers from a variety of
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
03:24:40.250 --> 03:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
and so I think one of the one of the
 
03:24:42.590 --> 03:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
things that we did on the commission
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
was really looked at the concept of our
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
students across the state
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
and where are those students that need
 
03:24:50.760 --> 03:24:52.190 align:start position:0%
and where are those students that need
help

03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:24:54.170 --> 03:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
as David was saying you know there are
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
communities that are Tapped Out
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
and what is our what's our
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state
 
03:25:02.210 --> 03:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
to look at those communities and to
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
provide some resources there that they
 
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
may not be able to provide for
 
03:25:08.210 --> 03:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
themselves just because their tax base
 
03:25:10.490 --> 03:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
is much lower than others across the
 
03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:11.750 align:start position:0%
is much lower than others across the
state

03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so for me the question is is how do we
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
take the resources that we currently
 
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
have in our state and that's what the
 
03:25:20.210 --> 03:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
commission looked at
 
03:25:22.250 --> 03:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
the commission looked at what are the
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
what's the the billions of dollars that
 
03:25:27.650 --> 03:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
were currently providing for
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
how do we allocate those in a different
 
03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:30.769 align:start position:0%
how do we allocate those in a different
way

03:25:30.769 --> 03:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:25:33.889 --> 03:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
that can help those students
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
and look at the issue of our kids
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
in a generic way across the state rather
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
than just looking at what my child is
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting in a particular community
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
I know that's a tough question to deal
 
03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
with because we all want the best for
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
our child
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
but there's a greater hole out here
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
that this is trying that this that this
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to address and I know
 
03:26:00.889 --> 03:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very difficult concept
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
because it's so intricate it's had so
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
many parts here but we I would hope that
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
based upon the conversations that we
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
have had or and will have
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
will say you know this is an issue folks
 
03:26:16.250 --> 03:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
we need to look at this
 
03:26:19.070 --> 03:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
in a systemic kind of a way
 
03:26:22.370 --> 03:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
and create a a system that's fair
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mel
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'll go go ahead
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to go back to
 
03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:35.570 align:start position:0%
I wanted to go back to
um

03:26:35.570 --> 03:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:38.450 --> 03:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
what Rhett Porter had said about the
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
number one thing which determines
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
outcome is the education level of the
 
03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:45.170 align:start position:0%
outcome is the education level of the
parents

03:26:45.170 --> 03:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I saw that in Nashua
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
um because Nash was one school district
 
03:26:54.410 --> 03:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
right and they have the same people the
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
same school board the same everything
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
and yet the different schools have
 
03:27:03.170 --> 03:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
different outcomes and you look at it
 
03:27:05.389 --> 03:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
it's not because one school has access
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
to more money than another school has
 
03:27:10.610 --> 03:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
because it's all one District
 
03:27:12.889 --> 03:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
but it's drawing the schools are
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods schools and they're
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
drawing from different education levels
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the parents and it makes a huge
 
03:27:22.250 --> 03:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
difference so I think before we say oh
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
well let's just give these guys more
 
03:27:24.239 --> 03:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
well let's just give these guys more
money

03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
let's look at what is it that makes the
 
03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:31.130 align:start position:0%
let's look at what is it that makes the
difference

03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
in those kids in how they do based on
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
the education level of their parents and
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
how what are we going to do in the
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
school that's going to make up for
 
03:27:46.070 --> 03:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
03:27:49.010 --> 03:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
that it you know that isn't happening or
 
03:27:51.290 --> 03:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
is happening or whatever I think I think
 
03:27:53.469 --> 03:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
before we start putting
 
03:27:56.150 --> 03:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
divvying up money we need to figure out
 
03:27:59.090 --> 03:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
what is it for how can we make a
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
difference what is the difference
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
between what's going on with the kids
 
03:28:05.330 --> 03:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
who have a better education better
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
educated parents and those that don't
 
03:28:11.450 --> 03:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
because you see it in Nashua and that
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with how much money a
 
03:28:16.130 --> 03:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
community can have or any of that
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
because it's all the same Community it's
 
03:28:20.769 --> 03:28:20.779 align:start position:0%
all the same school district
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:26.690 --> 03:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
types of neighborhoods with different
 
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
types of Education of the parents and so
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
I hate to just throw money at something
 
03:28:36.410 --> 03:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
and say well give it more money and and
 
03:28:39.050 --> 03:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
it'll magically happen I think we need
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be looking at underlying issues what
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um we're getting close to
 
03:28:51.050 --> 03:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
lunch here and um
 
03:28:53.809 --> 03:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
I had planned on having some you know a
 
03:28:56.090 --> 03:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
presentation from doe today on special
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
education this afternoon but she was not
 
03:28:58.080 --> 03:28:59.150 align:start position:0%
education this afternoon but she was not
available

03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh but what I'd like to do is that we've
 
03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
had a good discussion on our situation
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
we have in terms of the foundation
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
formula for the state of adequacy and
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
funding of it and I think we all have in
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
our own minds of of where we'd like to
 
03:29:16.020 --> 03:29:17.210 align:start position:0%
our own minds of of where we'd like to
be

03:29:17.210 --> 03:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:29:19.130 --> 03:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
and but the question is how are we going
 
03:29:22.010 --> 03:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
to get there I think what we need to do
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
is that we need to each of us take 1680
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
between now and the time we meet again
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
look it over look down at that and say
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
does this have some of the elements
 
03:29:35.690 --> 03:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
within it that are going to get us to
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
that Target we want to get to in terms
 
03:29:40.849 --> 03:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
of funding education in our state
 
03:29:43.849 --> 03:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
at the end of uh this whole discussion
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
we answer a subcommittee have the
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility of making a
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation either up or down or up
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
up with recommendations down for some
 
03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
reason whatever to the full education
 
03:29:58.670 --> 03:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee and then that of course report
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
goes into the calendar for the whole uh
 
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
Community to our legislature to have so
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to between now and the time we
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
meet again look at 1680
 
03:30:14.090 --> 03:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
renew yourself with what's in here
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
then come back and say here's some of
 
03:30:18.610 --> 03:30:18.620 align:start position:0%
the real components of that that I like
 
03:30:21.410 --> 03:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
here's some areas that maybe that you
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
may be looked at and and some healthy
 
03:30:26.690 --> 03:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
discussion on I don't want I I don't
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
want to come in here and not spin our
 
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
Wheels but discuss uh all the reasons
 
03:30:34.790 --> 03:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
why we had this before us we know those
 
03:30:37.490 --> 03:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
reasons we know them that there's you
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
know there are the communities that are
 
03:30:41.690 --> 03:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
like the berlins of the world and the
 
03:30:43.130 --> 03:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
new parts of the world and then we do
 
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
know that there's the lebanons of the
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
world and the the communities which have
 
03:30:51.410 --> 03:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal and and actually can
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
show us
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is great their their
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
scores reflect that and the kids are
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
going on to the world of work and and
 
03:31:02.090 --> 03:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
with the skills that they need my
 
03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
community may not need to have students
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
going off with all those type of skills
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
they may need some other type of skills
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
which are or you know taught through a
 
03:31:12.410 --> 03:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
different way but it's all part of our
 
03:31:14.210 --> 03:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
world there is different than the world
 
03:31:16.250 --> 03:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
down in Rochester
 
03:31:19.150 --> 03:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
so or or Portsmouth
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
so so yes
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
a question our is our our task here I
 
03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
a question our is our our task here I
believe

03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
is to make one of two recommendations
 
03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
right one is no we don't recommend any
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
further action or or further legislation
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
or yes we need further legislation are
 
03:31:43.250 --> 03:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
those are the two options we with that
 
03:31:44.929 --> 03:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
latter option you've always you've
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes we need further
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
legislation but we've also attached to
 
03:31:52.330 --> 03:31:52.340 align:start position:0%
many of the issues we've discussed
 
03:31:56.450 --> 03:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations to improve upon or to
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
change to get that going forward
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that's very important
 
03:32:01.560 --> 03:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
um I think that's very important
component

03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
component
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what we've got to really start
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
honing in on is if we can and we should
 
03:32:10.130 --> 03:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
everybody should be taking a healthy
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
look at this this bill
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and looking over and saying because
 
03:32:15.889 --> 03:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
I can look at that bill too and there
 
03:32:17.570 --> 03:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
are a lot of areas I like there were
 
03:32:19.969 --> 03:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
some areas which I had questioned you
 
03:32:22.130 --> 03:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how to measure the
 
03:32:23.809 --> 03:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
attitude of the teacher in the classroom
 
03:32:26.269 --> 03:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether they're you know
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's the quality teacher or not or or
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know other than through the local
 
03:32:32.570 --> 03:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
principle of doing the observations
 
03:32:35.570 --> 03:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
saying you don't meet our what we have
 
03:32:38.210 --> 03:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
for our goals in this school or the
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
standards of the state and or how do you
 
03:32:44.690 --> 03:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
measure the the the parent uh and
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
involvement in in working the you know
 
03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
we know that we have a lot of issues
 
03:32:52.010 --> 03:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
that other health impaired category
 
03:32:55.490 --> 03:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
within the IEPs is skyrocketing on us
 
03:32:57.410 --> 03:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that's the result of the pandemic
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
and and some of the parenting skills
 
03:33:02.210 --> 03:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
that have gone on and the the kids not
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
being in schools
 
03:33:06.530 --> 03:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
um so that there are a lot of issues
 
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
that I that a test is not necessarily
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
going to be the answer to assess that
 
03:33:14.690 --> 03:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
but but in order to attain the goal I
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
have of really helping the districts
 
03:33:18.910 --> 03:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
which need the help
 
03:33:21.769 --> 03:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
what are their specific needs and will
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
additional dollars do that I want to
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
really delve into that a little bit
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
myself and I think we need to and would
 
03:33:31.130 --> 03:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
you please grab a copy of that if you
 
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't have one that we commission
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
two boxes and I would recommend
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's a big doc yeah but there is an
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
executive summary
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
that does a really good job about my uh
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
what the executive summary of the
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation yeah
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
now don't let the dollar figure of
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
anything scare you away let's let's look
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
at you know the policy decisions within
 
03:34:04.130 --> 03:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
that and the elements uh I I know that
 
03:34:07.130 --> 03:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at dollars uh but in
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
for this committee we want to look does
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
this will this get to where we need to
 
03:34:12.540 --> 03:34:13.670 align:start position:0%
this will this get to where we need to
get

03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
um could you tell us about the book that
 
03:34:18.650 --> 03:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
you have over there the the name of it
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
and the author sure
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's called schoolhouses courthouses and
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
state houses
 
03:34:24.479 --> 03:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
state houses
and

03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
believe it or not when I talked with
 
03:34:31.610 --> 03:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
Bill ardinger just last Friday
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
said this book basically says we're
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
looking for performance outcomes we're
 
03:34:39.769 --> 03:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
looking exactly what the bill is trying
 
03:34:43.130 --> 03:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
to do as well it it doesn't get down in
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
all the the key elements that are within
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
the bill but it does say outputs
 
03:34:50.210 --> 03:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
performance is what we want to be
 
03:34:53.090 --> 03:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
looking at so there's a lot of parallels
 
03:34:56.450 --> 03:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
in this book here and it's a it's a yes
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
it came out a few years ago it's older
 
03:34:58.920 --> 03:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
it came out a few years ago it's older
but

03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good research there
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
then we don't want to throw it out
 
03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:04.849 align:start position:0%
then we don't want to throw it out
so

03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I I I would encourage if you can get
 
03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
a hold of something like this look it
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
over uh
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's kind of boring to read all the
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
parts within it but it has some his
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
chapters which are kind of meaty you may
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
have liked that uh uh
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
so okay so yes
 
03:35:22.620 --> 03:35:29.950 align:start position:0%
so okay so yes
March

03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if there's a interim
 
03:35:36.910 --> 03:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
study bill that I filed you know Skip no
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh meeting has been scheduled for yes
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering did we do intend
 
03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.819 --> 03:35:50.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:35:50.450 --> 03:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
ah see
 
03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:58.969 align:start position:0%
ah see
penny

03:35:58.969 --> 03:35:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.010 --> 03:36:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.020 --> 03:36:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
Glenn actually
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
I believe there was for each of the yeah
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
reach the ones I'll take a look at the
 
03:36:16.849 --> 03:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
scheduling I was yeah tied up with the
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
primary the interims for the co-ops is
 
03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%

yes

03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be meeting
 
03:37:37.610 --> 03:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of these issues are all linked
 
03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
and so if you're able to attend some of
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
these other meetings it might be wise to
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
try and just get a handle because I know
 
03:37:50.450 --> 03:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
we will be in that shortage me looking
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the pipeline and that's extremely the
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
pipeline meaning post-secondary
 
03:37:57.290 --> 03:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
education how that's impacting public
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
education availability of certification
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
people certification of people and and
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
getting more information from those
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
education departments
 
03:38:10.729 --> 03:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
important stuff
 
03:38:10.739 --> 03:38:15.650 align:start position:0%
important stuff
um

03:38:15.650 --> 03:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the 27th that's the legislative
 
03:38:19.610 --> 03:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
that's a statutory committee I'm not
 
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's already been scheduled but
 
03:38:26.330 --> 03:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
what's going to be presented at that
 
03:38:30.410 --> 03:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
might be you know Wise that you you come
 
03:38:32.690 --> 03:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
and participate
 
03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:33.370 align:start position:0%
and participate
um

03:38:33.370 --> 03:38:33.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:37.150 --> 03:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
Rick yeah if I can so so this is a a
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee actually that had been a
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
statutory Committee in law for a number
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
of years and hadn't met in a while and
 
03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
then it was well it was let go it was
 
03:38:54.729 --> 03:38:54.739 align:start position:0%
let go by us and then and then we
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
reformatted it or re did it yet we put
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
in a new bill this this yeah just a few
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
just you know this year to re-establish
 
03:39:05.170 --> 03:39:05.180 align:start position:0%
this so this will be the first meeting
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
of of it and I think you know it like I
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
said it hasn't met in a while this will
 
03:39:12.650 --> 03:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
become very active because it's about
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement and performance
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
of our academic standards right and and
 
03:39:21.050 --> 03:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of activity going on right
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
now with Ed rules
 
03:39:25.610 --> 03:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
um uh um 306.
 
03:39:28.490 --> 03:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
and and so this is an area that that uh
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that this statutory committee um has
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah what we want to do is look at the
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
next time as from that was the next
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
thing on the dock here in the calendar
 
03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
um are there any dates which are not
 
03:39:48.410 --> 03:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
good for folks on on the committee here
 
03:39:48.420 --> 03:39:50.090 align:start position:0%
good for folks on on the committee here
that's

03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:39:57.769 --> 03:39:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.290 --> 03:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
skip October 6th
 
03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:04.969 align:start position:0%
skip October 6th
okay

03:40:04.969 --> 03:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.370 --> 03:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
are you getting in any discussion on the
 
03:40:07.380 --> 03:40:13.570 align:start position:0%
are you getting in any discussion on the
Medicaid

03:40:13.570 --> 03:40:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.570 --> 03:40:16.580 align:start position:0%
automatic identification and
 
03:40:19.610 --> 03:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
implementation of meals through direct
 
03:40:22.210 --> 03:40:22.220 align:start position:0%
certification but
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
I know it's a little off from what your
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.929 --> 03:40:35.939 align:start position:0%
we haven't really gone anywhere with it
 
03:40:35.939 --> 03:40:39.170 align:start position:0%
we haven't really gone anywhere with it
yeah

03:40:39.170 --> 03:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hunger people came in
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
and talked to us and she mentioned
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.160 --> 03:41:12.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
how much time do you need everybody to
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
review 1680 and really come up with some
 
03:41:22.729 --> 03:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
to share some of your thoughts on
 
03:41:28.250 --> 03:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
whether it contains elements or some
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
areas which you know we need to discuss
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the bill we need to get
 
03:41:35.330 --> 03:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
down into that
 
03:41:38.929 --> 03:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
so it's a couple weeks needed if that is
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
then we could meet that week
 
03:41:47.889 --> 03:41:47.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:56.570 --> 03:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
yeah that's open for myself
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be here the Third
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the sixth
 
03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:08.690 align:start position:0%
and the sixth

03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.610 --> 03:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay well it's not gonna work then
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
That's The Advisory Group for your
 
03:42:24.290 --> 03:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:52.929 align:start position:0%

03:42:52.929 --> 03:42:52.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.090 --> 03:43:04.100 align:start position:0%

03:43:38.170 --> 03:43:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.330 --> 03:43:40.340 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.540 --> 03:43:46.969 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
so from all my notes on 1680 right here
 
03:43:54.410 --> 03:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'm all ready to go okay please look at
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
it and write stuff down because we need
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
to get on with it uh we're gonna have to
 
03:44:02.570 --> 03:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation here
 
03:44:02.580 --> 03:44:05.330 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation here
shortly

03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay no more said thank you for coming
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it was another comment made earlier
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
so it's not really about to build as
 
03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
much but I think um representative
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
Nelson said
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
um about the unions and they protect bag
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
teachers and it stings and we were
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the quality of teachers
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that's actually
 
03:44:30.650 --> 03:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
accurate I think
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the whole in my experience from
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
negotiations is that
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um we negotiated teach and
 
03:44:40.010 --> 03:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
differentiated teacher evaluation plans
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the whole goal of
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
if teachers aren't doing as well as they
 
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
should be then there's a plan put forth
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
how do they get better or if they don't
 
03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
perform then they can release them but
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's a step so I just wanted to say
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
that say I think years ago maybe that
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
was the way it was but right now I think
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
we do have evaluation plans
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
for teachers to improve and if they
 
03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:05.690 align:start position:0%
for teachers to improve and if they
don't

03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:45:07.370 --> 03:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
then there's a consequence for that
 
03:45:09.769 --> 03:45:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you and I actually one
 
03:45:12.769 --> 03:45:12.779 align:start position:0%
more uh just in rep in response to uh
 
03:45:15.050 --> 03:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative lakis uh in terms of
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
money and programs like even in my
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
district when they were trying to
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
address those kids and needed extra help
 
03:45:25.969 --> 03:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
then they instituted the our um response
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
to intervention RTI and that cost money
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
so even in a district that has funds I
 
03:45:32.929 --> 03:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
mean all of these
 
03:45:36.349 --> 03:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
um there are things that these schools
 
03:45:38.090 --> 03:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
do to help these kids that aren't
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
performing as well they do cost money so
 
03:45:43.250 --> 03:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's all nothing's free nothing's free
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
