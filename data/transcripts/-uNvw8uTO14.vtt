like this
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
she's Brave she puts some together
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
so there's no voting okay or do we have
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
call house finance committee to order
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're here for a public hearing on a
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment I would like to
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
welcome Chuck grassy our new member
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
through the finance committee
 
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.950 align:start position:0%
through the finance committee
um

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
and I will um
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
call on representative J.R Hull to
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
introduce amendment number zero seven
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
to introduce as you just said
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
two zero two three zero seven six seven
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
eight I'm going to be looking at both
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then there's a
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison between this and
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
an amendment that division three had
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
worked on prior that was the foundation
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the original Amendment which was 804
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
we were looking at six to twelve beds
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
this plan is an operate 12 beds only
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
um it makes and the reason that this is
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
a non-germaine amendment is on page two
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
of the comparison it has to do with a
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
bill that was adopted by the prior
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
Legislature House Bill 254
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
out of the house but I don't think
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
became law relative to who could be
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
committed to
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and this is where it
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
starts to change from the current list
 
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
of people and the various crimes that
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
they could be committed under to the
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
most serious of crimes right all all the
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
all the crimes against a person that are
 
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
significant murder or sexual assault all
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
of those type crimes and not all the
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
ones that are currently things that
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be a Class A misdemeanor because
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
of stealing an iPad right the the value
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
of goods has changed so significantly
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
over time and we haven't kept up with
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the laws that potentially you could
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerate kids for
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
um very serious crimes but very serious
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
being defined by the value of an item
 
00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:00.019 align:start position:0%
and there is at least some information
 
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220 align:start position:0%
that has been presented to the committee
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
that incarcerating youth under those
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
conditions actually causes more harm in
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
the long term it doesn't help them
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate so if we limit the number
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
of crimes that people are going to the
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
Student News Center we can keep the
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
population lower down into 12 beds
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll close my testimony
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
unless there's any other questions
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
representative hole are you aware that
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
both the chair and vice chair of
 
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:42.740 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Law have HB 120
 
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
retained in their committee and uh they
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
have uh they they would be here except
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
for their an exec session right now
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
voting but they have both told me that
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
they would prefer that any changes to
 
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
the criminal statutes be sent to them
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
because they've not had an opportunity
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
to hear it this term and they think it's
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for their jurisdiction
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
than the finance committee have you
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Edwards yes I have
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the finance side
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
we're not a policy committee
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
the current cost
 
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:28.970 align:start position:0%
the current cost
um

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're looking at like 87 I think the
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
budget request was 87 people for the
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
roughly 12 on average children that are
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the sununu center
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
we're looking at an operating budget
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's somewhere between 10 and 12
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars right so this is our
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
incarceration costs are somewhere
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
between 800 000 and a million dollars
 
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420 align:start position:0%
per child
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at what is the
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
appropriate list to put in the center
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
given the extraordinarily high cost for
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
incarceration of Youth
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
um and that was talked about in in this
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
amendment in particular regarding
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
Staffing ratios and designing a building
 
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:09.380 align:start position:0%
that long term would be set up and and
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
strategically to have lower Staffing
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
ratios I mean having 87 people
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
for roughly 12 children on average is
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
almost eight staff members per child
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's a huge number so I think
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
there may be a way long term to keep the
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
cost in line but yes to your point to
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
your question exactly I that policy
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
question was historically won by
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
children and family law but it might
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
need to be taken up this time around
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
here because of the impact on right the
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
the total cost of the facility for both
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.970 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
Hull

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hull
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee when I when I signed up to to
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill you know on the
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
signed a pink card it said uh
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
um do you support or do you oppose and I
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
was really and in a quandary about
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what to say because I very
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
strongly support the overall thrust of
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
this bill to close the sununu center and
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
build a new facility and and build it in
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
accordance with uh you know the terms
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
that are set set out in the uh in the uh
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.810 align:start position:0%
in the bill
um

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
I I have concerns about the what I would
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
refer to as the 254 aspect of it that's
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
the bill number from last year that
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
purports to change the
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
um the crimes for which a person can be
 
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.769 align:start position:0%
um the crimes for which a person can be
committed

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I would say I've had
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
extensive discussions with with
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative erf and representative
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards about this and I think that the
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
proposal as it is reflected in the
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just referred to by
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
representative Hull
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I I'm all right with that I think
 
00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
I think that that
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
um you know that uh
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
is is okay in the sense that it it my
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
main concern last year and this year has
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
been that
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the there was a prior version that
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
did not that would have excluded
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
any potential for someone being
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
committed for serious property crimes no
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
matter how serious and so the example
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
that you know that what I what the
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
example I've used before and I think
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
really would highlight this is if
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
someone if a if a juvenile even a
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile with a serious prior record
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
were to were to come in and you know
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
burglarize your home when you weren't
 
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
there so there was no danger of physical
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know of physical harm but literally
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
clean out your home destroy it
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
um uh unless you unless the the terms
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
that were included in the most recent
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative oh uh
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
proposed there would be no possibility
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
of a juvenile being able to be committed
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
for even one day and it just seems to me
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't make sense
 
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:24.860 align:start position:0%
so I I guess what I bottom line is I I
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
think the proposed amendment is is sort
 
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
of acceptable
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
with one caveat and that is that and
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked to representative erf about
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
this and I've actually submitted a
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment which I think maybe
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards may talk about at
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.689 align:start position:0%
some point
um

00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the the proposal
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
allows for commitments of juveniles
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
for certain offenses that are specified
 
00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:56.509 align:start position:0%
for certain offenses that are specified
in

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
section 169 B
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
um uh uh 19 1 J and 1M
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
in order to have the bill make sense
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
you need to make a similar change in in
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
terms of what for what offenses can
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
somebody be detained
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that that is not in
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
the bill right now it is in my Amendment
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh I think my amendment is eight number
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
eight ninety two but if you don't make
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
that change
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
you would you could literally have a
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
situation I think and this to me just
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
sounds crazy it doesn't make any sense
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
you could literally have a situation
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
where a juvenile is arrested for a very
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
serious property crime or maybe even
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
some other crime that's that's very
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
serious but is not among the the ones
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
that are that are listed
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
um in J and you could have a situation
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
where everybody knows from the outset
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
that this is an offense that that merits
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
the the child is going to get some
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
period of commitment at uh at a secure
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
facility and yet the judge has no power
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law would be precluded
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
from detaining the child so I mean you
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
know I I mean literally I I this is so
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
maybe I I'm I'm making up a you know
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
sort of an absurd situation but
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
literally under the law this would apply
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
you could have that situation like that
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
I gave the example of the judge of the
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
person trashing the house when you're
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
not home the person could literally be
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
charged with uh uh under subsection M
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
come into court for the preliminary
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and tell the judge you know
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
listen judge I'm not going to show up
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do about it and
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
the answer the judge would the judge
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
would have to say nothing because the
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
law if you don't make the change that
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
I've suggested the law would be sorry
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
even though everybody knows that this is
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
a very serious crime a very serious
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
juvenile offense that the person might
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh be committed for or would be
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
committed for you you have to let the
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
person there you you could not impose A
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
A detention you can impose some other
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
things but you can't impose detention
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
which to me doesn't doesn't make sense
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
um the last point I would make and I
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
have to say honestly I had not thought
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
about this but I hope you'll pay
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
really careful attention to what
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
director ribsom has to say because he
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
raises a very good point about
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the uh the situation of changing the
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
law from what it is now to remove things
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
which the which the both my Amendment
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
and representative wolves remember do to
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
remove simple assault from the offenses
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
that that are potentially the basis for
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
detention or commitment and he gives
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
really good examples of sometimes there
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
are situation not very often doesn't
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
happen often but sometimes there can be
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
situations and I think he gave the
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
example of a child that assaults his
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
parents and the child doesn't there
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
aren't any other family members
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
available or there's no there isn't
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
foster care or whatever available and If
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
you if the if the law is that even that
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances the the uh the
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
the court can't commit the juvenile to a
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
secure facility even for a few days
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um but then what happens I mean what are
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
you going to do in that kind of
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
situation is the the juvenile can't go
 
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.110 align:start position:0%
situation is the the juvenile can't go
home

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's it just seems to me that that
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
to make the law so strict that it
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the flexibility to
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
accommodate that I think is is really
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
problematic and I guess then the last
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
thing that I would say is is this
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
I think there's much to representative
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh Edward's point about this uh this
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill not having gone to
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
the policy committee uh for review
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I would also note I I just I I think
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to note this it seems to
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
me getting the sununu center done the
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
new sunun said done is is crucial it's
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
got to be a number one priority
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that injecting this aspect
 
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:16.940 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
puts that at least to some extent at
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
risk uh because they're I I my
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
impression is that the Senate may not
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
have the same view
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
about this 254 aspect of this
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
um as as these proposed amendments do
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
um and and why raise why
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
why raise that issue why not have that
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
just as a separate matter get the sununu
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
Center built a new one done and and and
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
then deal with this as a separate issue
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would be my my uh my suggestion but
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh anyway thank you that's all I have to
 
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.409 align:start position:0%
uh anyway thank you that's all I have to
say

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
questions from any Committee Member
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and then
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire uh thank you uh
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I think there's a couple
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
three questions I'd like to ask
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn that are all related
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
to one another
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
um I I'm a little confused by your
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
testimony sir I I at one point I thought
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that you support uh
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven six seven and then
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
as you continue to talk it sounded to me
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
like you weren't really in support
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
because you had concerns about how
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
simple assault and property crimes might
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
be treated and so I I just want to make
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear on what your position is
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
if is it yes or no on zero seven six
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
seven so I get I mean I guess I guess
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
what I would what I meant to say is zero
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
seven six seven I think is an
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
improvement over the bill that didn't
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
have any potential for hold for property
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
crimes but I think it is I I I could not
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
support it if the if if the terms of the
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
change the that allow that would allow
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
detention are not included and and those
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
are only included in my in the amendment
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
that I proposed which is I think eight
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
nine two so without that I could not
 
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.130 align:start position:0%
nine two so without that I could not
support

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
um 767. the other point that I the other
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
point that I would make is although with
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
that oh well with that change I I I
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
could support 767 I think that they're
 
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460 align:start position:0%
that director ribson has very valid
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
concerns about excluding simple assault
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
if uh you know is it is it something
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
that would cause me to vote against this
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
bill if it came to the floor assuming
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
the other changes were made I I I don't
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
know but I think it I think he does have
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
valid concerns that I think you should
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
pay close attention to follow up follow
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
up so so I I've heard you mentioned a
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
couple of times that you have an
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
amendment that you think improves zero
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
seven six seven and I'm I'm I guess the
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
question is to the chair uh at what
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
point should we be entertaining that
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
alternative that representative Lynn
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
thinks may be an improvement
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
I don't have a copy of it um Mr Ripple
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we'll finish the hearing
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
on 767 before we introduce the next one
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
represent and then I have just another
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
question yes sir this is this is sort of
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
my final one in this bucket
 
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.750 align:start position:0%
my final one in this bucket
um

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn I I have in talking
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
to people about the changes and
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
narrowing of the possible charges under
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
which somebody may be detained or
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
committed to the the new center
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard concerns that if we narrow it
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
in the real world what we may end up
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
having is the undetended consequence
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of having
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutors or judges uh thinking that
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
the the kid needs to be put somewhere
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
safe for Public Safety and and that may
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
tend to cause overcharging to be taking
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
place and and if and if that is true I'd
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
like to know if you think that that may
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
be a valid concern and if it is a valid
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
concern might we end up doing
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um sort of you know some harm to some
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
kids because they end up getting
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
overcharged I think that's a very a very
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
real concern that that I mean if you
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
know if you if
 
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
put yourself in the position of a
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and and in the first instance
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
and maybe a judge if if the if the
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances are such that that it's
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
clear to the prosecutor and and later
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
down the road to the judge that this
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
person needs to be detained or needs to
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
be committed
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and and the law you know the law of
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
let's say of of charging it as a
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor just completely precludes
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that then the the prosecutor is going to
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
make a strong may very well make a very
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
strong effort to charge it as a felony
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
um and and so you know the question I
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
guess is do you really want
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
do you really want to sort of tie the
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's hands so that that that
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's the only alternative you leave
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
them I I would suggest that
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't want to do that and
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
particularly I would suggest that you
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't want to do that where under
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the existing law you've had such a a
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
very significant reduction in the
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
population of the of the current sununu
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
Center that's under existing law
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
um so it that tends to show that you
 
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
know prosecutors and judges are
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
exercising their discretion
 
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.789 align:start position:0%
exercising their discretion
appropriately

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you I I wasn't going to ask us
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
but I think it it dovetails nicely with
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
that last remark is it is it is it a
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
correct understanding that currently
 
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:58.340 align:start position:0%
under the existing New Hampshire law
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
that this state
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
holds the high honor of having the
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
various very lowest level in the nation
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
in terms of per capita kids being
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
committed or detained we're already
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
number one in the lowest how low can you
 
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.250 align:start position:0%
number one in the lowest how low can you
go

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
I you know I have not done any
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
independent investigation of that but
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
I've heard that that's true and I guess
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
the other just one other point that I
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
would make on that is I and maybe some
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses if they've done further
 
00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:30.419 align:start position:0%
research can correct me but at least as
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
I know that
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
um from from others I have again I
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
haven't done any independent
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
investigation of this but what I was
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
what from things that other people have
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
said it's my understanding that if you
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
were to adopt the restrict the new
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
changes that are proposed to to further
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
restrict offenses that can be the basis
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
of commitment no other state has gone
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
that far Illinois I think has maybe has
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
come the closest but no other state will
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
have gone as far as we have gone
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for question
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:09.049 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
but isn't there a connection between the
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
list of crimes that can cause commitment
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
and the size of facility that we need
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
the number assigned to the facility has
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
gone down you're attributing it to
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
um the attitudes of Judges now but but
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
if the law doesn't doesn't do that
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
restriction could later judges
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
start ballooning the number and now we
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
have a facility that's inadequate well I
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
I I I mean is it possible that judges in
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
the future will begin to act
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
unreasonably I suppose yes I suppose it
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
is and I suppose if they do
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um then that would be the time to change
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
the law but given given that you know
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the existing law the the
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
population has gone down tremendously
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
you know everybody
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
has sort of thought that you know that
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
that has had a different attitude about
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
the way that that juvenile offenders
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
should be dealt with
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a pretty Broad
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know sort of across the board
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
spectrum of of of uh where people stand
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
see none thank you representative thank
 
00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:37.010 align:start position:0%
see none thank you representative thank
you

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%

the next call on representative Marjorie
Smith

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Marjorie Smith
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
representing Durham I'm in my 13th term
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
and for many of those terms I sat where
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
you are sitting now
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
with any number of you on the committee
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
for two of those terms I was chair of
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
and it is because of that that my
 
00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:20.049 align:start position:0%
and it is because of that that my
conscience

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:20.059 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
weighs so heavily on me because we have
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
known for many years
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
of what was happening at the sununu
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
center and for any number of reasons or
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
unable to find a way out
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
my conscience is heavy
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
there was a time when uh
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
the department wanted to have
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
young people children who were in sununu
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid not necessarily
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to have access to
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
health care for them but because they
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
wanted the revenue
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government came in and we
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
met with them
 
00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:11.900 align:start position:0%
and they refused to go along
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
not because there was barbed wire around
 
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:19.700 align:start position:0%
sununa which is one
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
reason why you would not be eligible for
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but because
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
within the facility itself the people
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
who were operating the facility then
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
were violating not just federal law but
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
the federal representative said you are
 
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.470 align:start position:0%
the federal representative said you are
restraining

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
restraining
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
juveniles in your facility and you're
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
putting juveniles into solitary
 
00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.889 align:start position:0%
putting juveniles into solitary
confinement

00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
and the state representative said well
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
yeah but but we're working on that we're
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we can find
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
in violation of what the law that we in
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
this body had passed that juvenile
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
should not be restrained
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're not talking here about baseball
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
we're not talking here about if you
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
build it they will come we're talking
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
about young people who are in a system
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that is separate from the adult system
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
because we all know and each year we
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
find more research that that makes clear
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
that juvenile brains are not fully
 
00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:44.210 align:start position:0%
that juvenile brains are not fully
developed

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
and juveniles cannot be held or should
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
not be held accountable to the same
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
standards that you must hold adults I've
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
listened to words this morning including
 
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.330 align:start position:0%
listened to words this morning including
crimes

00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
and criminals
 
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:04.340 align:start position:0%
juveniles are not
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
criminals they are juveniles and that is
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
very very different do we have
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
horribly troubled confused young people
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
of course we do and we know that do we
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
know that the worst thing we can do
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
is to institutionalize those young
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
people particularly with other people
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
who have some of the same problems take
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
them out of their own communities deny
 
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
them out of their own communities deny
them

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to try to find a way
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
through to where they could become
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
responsible adults
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
so my concern is I I disagree as you can
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
well imagine with the Senate approach of
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
saying the more the merrier I think we
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
should have the smallest possible system
 
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:04.100 align:start position:0%
I think we should have a system that
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
makes sure that the greatest extent
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
possible children are cared for in their
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
own communities perhaps not in their own
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
homes but certainly in their own
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
communities because we want them to be
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
able to come back and function as adults
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
in those communities and that is why we
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
created a juvenile system years ago I
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the the my
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
current chair on Judiciary Committee
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the attempts that are
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
being made in this amendment to
 
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.049 align:start position:0%
being made in this amendment to
recognize

00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
um that yes we need a facility
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
for for juveniles but we need it to be
 
00:32:56.529 --> 00:32:56.539 align:start position:0%
small we needed to make sure that
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
behaviors which are certainly not
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
acceptable to an adult and certainly are
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
not acceptable for children are treated
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
in a way that acknowledges the
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
difference between a juvenile brain and
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
an adult brain I I was interested to
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
hear the representative Edwards I don't
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
like to I mean he's just left the room
 
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.250 align:start position:0%
like to I mean he's just left the room
but

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:21.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:27.260 align:start position:0%
talk about uh the child and family law
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
committee wanting to have this bill to
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the crimes because if we're
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
talking about crimes then I think the
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
bill should go to criminal justice
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about juveniles
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
then I think that we see the difference
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
right there between an adult and a child
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
and as a long time member of this
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
committee and chair this committee I go
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
back to what representative McGuire
 
00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
talked about we have very limited
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
dollars available in this state and we
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
have to use standards that are very
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
clear and are designed to make sure that
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
we meet the essential needs of the
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and know more the
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
cost that we are incurring in operating
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
the sununu center the way we are now is
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
really not justifiable when we see the
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
long list of other issues that do demand
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
public attention so I hope that you will
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
support this effort which as you can see
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
clearly is a it's not just a bipartisan
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
effort it's an nonpartisan effort to put
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
young people
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
who are in trouble and need help first
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
and help us find a way to bring those
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
young people back into society where
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
they can be productive members so yes I
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and I thank you
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
members

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
the next call on director Joe ribson of
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
the Department of Children Youth and
 
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:25.250 align:start position:0%
the Department of Children Youth and
Family

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody Joe ripsom
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
director dcif good to see
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
um this committee on this issue for I
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't know third time in our division
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
three colleagues for
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know 8th 9th 10th time
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
um this session so glad to continue the
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
conversation hopefully we can get um
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
across the Finish Line with something
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
that works for for kids and families
 
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.430 align:start position:0%
that works for for kids and families
here

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
so I do have
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I first want to be clear we very
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
strongly support the
 
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:56.300 align:start position:0%
replacement of sysc with a smaller
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed program ideally
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
co-located in your facility where we
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
could share services and drive down
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
operational costs but also ideally share
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
services that mutually benefit the two
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
programs so for example if this was to
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
be co-located near say Hampstead you
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
would have common clinical common
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
education Etc if it was to be co-located
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
near the hospital of New Hampshire
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
hospital you wouldn't be able to share
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
this clinical and Education Service
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
would you be able to share other types
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
of services to help drive down the
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
operational costs but there are many
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
things in this amendment that I am very
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
very worried about and I'm going to just
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
try to quickly go through some of them
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm less worried about than others but
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to mention them just so that
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
folks have that information for the
 
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.630 align:start position:0%
folks have that information for the
future

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
that talks about changing the name of
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
the facility I have no problem with
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
changing the name of the facility but
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that line was not to
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
actually rename the facility the purpose
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
of that line was to make sure that the
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
new facility lined up with the rest of
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
the statutory scheme in terms of a Youth
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
Development Center which is how the rest
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
of the statute refers to this facility
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
so if folks want to change the name to
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
juvenile Treatment Center I wouldn't
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
object but somebody then has to do the
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
find and replace through the rest of the
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme to make sure that those
 
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 24 I have really big
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
concerns about this
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
so as representative Edwards mentioned
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
as representative Lynn mentioned we
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
currently have the lowest rate of
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment in the country
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
that's because of a couple things and
 
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.650 align:start position:0%
that's because of a couple things and
and

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire mentioned you
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
know that the law needs to align with
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
what our expectations are for what kids
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
can be detained or committed I would say
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
that that's happened largely already and
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'll go into more detail about that in a
 
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
I'll go into more detail about that in a
minute

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.050 align:start position:0%
minute
um

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what is driven down
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
the need for a detention or commitment
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
the other big pieces I've shared with
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
the committee in the past and won't go
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
super deep on is the creation of a
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
system of care that's actually allowing
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
us to Care overwhelmingly for kids in
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
their own communities right when I came
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
to this state five years ago we
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
typically had 70 kids in that building
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
today we typically have 12. when I came
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
to the state five years ago we typically
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
had 200 juveniles and residential
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
programs Juvenile Justice Youth and
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
residential programs today we have about
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
110. so the use of institutionalization
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a remedy for juvenile justice has
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
gone down radically and not just because
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
of the change in the law though that was
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
part of it also because we've built a
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
robust system of care for Behavioral
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Health that's meeting kids needs where
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
they are based on their needs and not
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
based on the offenses that they
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
committed which is the right way to do
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
this work I'm not going to go too deep
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
in that but what that ends up resulting
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
in is the few kids that do get sent to
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
sysc are very very high needs and very
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
very intense when you look at Staffing
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
ratios which shall not exceed those
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
supported by national accrediting bodies
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
in K I'm very worried for a couple
 
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
things one I don't know what these
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
National accrediting bodies are because
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
most juvenile detention centers are not
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
accredited by a national entity so I'm
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
not even sure what standards are talking
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
about but if you Google Staffing ratios
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
for Juvenile Justice entities what
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
they'll point to is the Prius standards
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
the prison rape elimination act
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
standards which is a one to eight ratio
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
one staff to eight youth we currently
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
have 12 very high needs in that facility
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
if we were to be operating under a Pria
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
standard of one to eight we would have
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
two staff for that building
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
that would be absolutely absurd we would
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
have law enforcement needs 24 7 to keep
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
that building just safe and we would
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
never ever come close to being able to
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
implement the trauma-informed care that
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
this bill talks about so I think I have
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
really big problems with that maybe the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the drafters had a different idea
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
about what that meant but that's how I
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
would read this and I think we need to
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
be very very cautious about that
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
the next three lines here 25 through 27
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a problem with us
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
talking about using this I would just
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
say that we did result we did consult
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
this as part of the process that
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
happened 18 months ago when we came up
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
with this plan in the first place and
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
that there are other parts of this plan
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
that we would continue to consult as we
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
move through the rest of a closure of
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
the facility the other things I would
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
mention though is that this plan was
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
really drafted not with the intent of
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
closing the only secured facility in the
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
state which is what we're talking about
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
here but it was drafted when talking
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
about closing one of many
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
secured facilities in a state right how
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
do you make the choice between the 20
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
facilities that you're operating which
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
one is the one to close so there's a lot
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
of things in this plan that aren't even
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
applicable to our situation that being
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
said the things that are applicable
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
applicable we looked at the other point
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'd mentioned is we're actually been
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
invited to this organization's
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
conference in two months to present on
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
how we've done this work better than any
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
other state in the country so you know I
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't really have a problem with with
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
including this in here but right the
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
meaning isn't all that isn't all that
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
significant for our current work
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
and then I would move forward to
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
so page five line 11 through 15 does two
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
different things it talks about the
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
operating budget not being more than the
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
average cost operating similar or
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
Juvenile facility in New England and
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
that sub and that biannually that that
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
be reviewed
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
with the lowest census in the country
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
with the highest need kids
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
we are not running the average facility
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
of anybody else we're running a much
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
different facility than everybody else
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
so having us try to have an operational
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
budget consistent with with averages of
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
any region or anything doesn't make any
 
00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:22.069 align:start position:0%
any region or anything doesn't make any
sense

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I know there was a report handed out
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
at a committee meeting that I wasn't at
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
that was talking about the cost of
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerating children per child if you
 
00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
review that and you were to compare the
 
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
other report that I shared about
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment rates you would
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
see that the states that have the lowest
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
cost per child also lock up the most
 
00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:39.410 align:start position:0%
cost per child also lock up the most
kids

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
what that really is it's a list of who
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
locks up the most kids and how that's
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
the cheapest window on your system and I
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
personally can't be part of a system
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
that that's the goal of and I don't
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
think many of us want to be part of a
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
system for which that's the goal so I
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
think we need to be really really
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and careful about things that
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
would limit the operating costs not
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
based on the needs of the kids that we
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
serve or based on the needs of of the
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
communities but rather based on some
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
type of average of a facility that is
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
nothing like the type of thing that
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
we're doing in New Hampshire because we
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
are so far ahead of the curve that you
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
can't compare us to the balance of the
 
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.270 align:start position:0%
can't compare us to the balance of the
Curve

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
um page five paragraph or section 7
 
00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:19.970 align:start position:0%
um page five paragraph or section 7
16-24

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
16-24
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not generally opposed to this what
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
this talks about is the requirements of
 
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.510 align:start position:0%
this talks about is the requirements of
the

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
um director of the facility
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
our last facility director retired in
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
January it took us till August to
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
replace that person and the main reason
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
why it took so long is that we wanted
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
somebody that met these criteria that
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
they actually had an advanced degree
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
that they're actually licensed clinician
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
that they actually did all that work so
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
we did fill that position this is in
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
line with the person that's currently
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
running the facility who I think is
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
doing an amazing job and it's in line
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
with what I would hope going forward I
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
would just caution that when you put
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
these types of things in statute it does
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
tie hands and who knows years from now
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to have a hard time
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
finding somebody with those
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications again I I don't really
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
oppose it because it's exactly what
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
we've looked for and exactly what I
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
think we'll continue to look for but you
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
know we are you're tying the hands of
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
future people that might have to make
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
decisions in in scarcity and that that's
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
a tough thing I'd point to the example
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
of our colleagues down in Rhode Island
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
who have been out without a permanent
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
child welfare director for almost four
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
years now because there is requires that
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
it be a master's prepared social worker
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
and they've been unable to find a
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
master's prepared social worker willing
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
to step into that job
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
now the biggest concerns that we heard
 
00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
most about have to do with these next
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
few sections section eight and nine
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
which start on page five line 24 and go
 
00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:44.630 align:start position:0%
which start on page five line 24 and go
through

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
page I guess you're referring to a
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
different uh Amendment oh I'm sorry am I
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
I I think you just meant line 25 not 24.
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
page five yeah page five line 25 through
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I am working on a printout that I
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
got before this morning so it is
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
through Page 721 so this is what's been
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
referred to as the HB 254 language
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
so a couple things that I think the
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
committee needs to understand one I do
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to have you
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
know the other committees look at this
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
who who go deeper into this work on a
 
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.060 align:start position:0%
regular basis but moreover
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
this language talks about commitment
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
right and we've had this conversation
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
before but commitment refers to the time
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
at which we're making a decision that a
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
child needs to be placed after you've
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicated them but other parts of the
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
law disallow you to also detain a young
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
person that's a temporary immediate
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
detention for things that are not
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
committable right so even though this
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
talks about commitment it equally
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
applies to detention
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
the big change here is
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not so concerned with the first part
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
of this because the second part is you
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
know is where most of this would come in
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's section nine
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
So currently very very few kids get
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
detained or committed at sysc the
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
reasons for that like I said system of
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
this document which I'm happy to share
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Kevin
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
that is the detention assessment and
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
screening tool
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
which is a court form which was put
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
together by people who actually work
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
with kids in these situations on a
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
regular basis right public defenders
 
00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:50.900 align:start position:0%
prosecutors probation officers
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
clinicians judges they put this together
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
to help them guide the decision as to
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
who gets detained or committed
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
I heard comments when I shared the data
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the past about how you saw the
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
commitment levels drop so radically but
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
detention levels really didn't move that
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
radically that's because they were using
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
this for years before the change in the
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
law that's what drove detention levels
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
down and it was done not just because of
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
the change in the law but because the
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
people who do the work care to try to
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
get that done
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
and what this sets up is different types
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
of offenses
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
and you can see that on the back couple
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
Pages here
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
and it sets up different scores for
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
different types of offenses as to when
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
they'd be eligible for detention or
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
commitment really this is just for
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
level four offenses are similar to the
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
things that are listed in the statute
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
right murder stuff like that absolutely
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
level three offenses little less severe
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
typical felonies though level two
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
offenses are things like Class A
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors things like simple assault
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and yes as
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
representative wholes said stealing an
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
iPad could be a Class A misdemeanor but
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
that is not the extent of what consists
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
of Class A misdemeanors and they have
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
never seen in five years a kid go to
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
sysc because they stole an iPad that's
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
not why they go there they go there
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
because there's issues of violence in
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
the home violence somewhere in the
 
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.250 align:start position:0%
the home violence somewhere in the
community

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
and this tool is what's guiding that so
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
if you look at the back two pack few
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
pages of this it has a list of all the
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses and it gives them a
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
level score
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
you would notice on here that simple
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
assault and domestic violence are only a
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
out of four if you go back to the first
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
page here
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see that a level two offense only
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
gets four points
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
the way that this process works you need
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
to get 12 points to be recommended for
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
detention so typically a simple a
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
smaller domestic violence Class A
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is not going to get you
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
detained or committed but what the rest
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
of this tool does is it goes through the
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
more nuanced things that a judge has to
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
think through when measuring Community
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
safety and risk to the child themselves
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
things like what other charges are
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
currently pending or have been recently
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
disposed of
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
has this child recently absconded or run
 
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.510 align:start position:0%
has this child recently absconded or run
away

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know there's also score things
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
that reduce the score right if the kids
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
got you know a safe place to return to
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
and this allows a judge to actually make
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
a nuanced decision about whether it's
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate to detain or commit a kid
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I would say the evidence that this
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
is working is the fact that we have the
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
lowest rate of detained kids in the
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
country there is one state that has a
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
lower detained alone than us that's
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
Maine they report zero I believe that
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's inaccurate I think it's a
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
semantical issue because they called
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
attention shock commitment so their
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
commitment numbers are really high their
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
detention numbers are zero if you
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
exclude that we have the lowest level of
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
detained kids in the entire country not
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
just attending committed combined but
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
detained and that's because we're really
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
good at trying to be careful not to use
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
this where we don't need to use it
 
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.609 align:start position:0%
this where we don't need to use it
so

00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
I am really worried about these changes
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
in section 9 because
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
where you put a Class A misdemeanor as
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
only being eligible for detention where
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
there are three prior defenses within
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
the past 12 months there is a potential
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
for a situation where you have a young
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
person who may be committed an act of
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
and is not safe to return home because
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
but it cannot be elevated to a felony
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
level because of the severity of the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
injury the biggest difference between
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a simple assault and an
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
aggravated assault or assault too is the
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
severity of the injury it's not really
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
about the incident or what the kid did
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's about how bad was the other person
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
hurt right and that really isn't the
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
measure I think that should be kind of
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
the end all be-all of the consideration
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
of whether safe kid is safe to return
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
home or safe to go somewhere else it
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
needs to be more nuanced in the way that
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
the courts and the people who do this
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
work have already thought through very
 
00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
work have already thought through very
thoroughly

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.870 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
um

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
moreover than that though this change
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
will not meaningfully impact the census
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
of sysc
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
there are almost no kids that get
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
detained for a single simple assault or
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
a single domestic violence charge
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly those kids are already
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
going to residential settings but the
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
fact that that safety valve exists
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
within the system allows law enforcement
 
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutors to feel comfortable
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
deferring bringing charges against kids
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
so you heard a bit of a conversation
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
with representative Lynn about concerns
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
that you could see prosecutors or judges
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
up charging kids or more more
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
significant that what I'm more worried
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
about as you see prosecutors being less
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
willing to defer bringing charges at all
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
because they're going to feel like they
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
need to get their three priors to make
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
sure that that kid's eligible for sysc
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
and doing this now when we're just in
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
the midst of implementing what I think
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
is a revolutionary change in the way
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
that we make these decisions for kids
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
would be terrible we just passed SB 94
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
about a year or so ago we've been
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
implementing it for a year now what SB
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
94 does is every time law enforcement
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
has contact with a kid
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
they come to us we do a child adolescent
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
needs and strengths tool assessment and
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
then we make a recommendation back to
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is this a kid that needs
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
to go to court or is this a kid that we
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
can use one of our many Community
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
Options instead
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
72 percent of the time we're saying
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's this kid shouldn't go to court
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't even bring this kid to
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
court in the first place this kid should
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
go to a community-based service and
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
totally avoid the Juvenile Justice
 
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.430 align:start position:0%
totally avoid the Juvenile Justice
System

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
System
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
94 of the time law enforcement is
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
agreeing with us
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
that's under the current system where
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
they know they have that safety valve if
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
they really need it if we were to change
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics here I very much worry that
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to find law enforcement
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
being really reluctant to defer filing
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
cases against kids because instead of
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that they have a safety valve
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
just in case things get too heavy and
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
there's an incident violence that they
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
need to respond to they're going to be
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
thinking I need to get three strikes or
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
else I'm not going to have that safety
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
valve in place
 
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
and at the time when we're really seeing
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
radical change in our system as a result
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
of the implementation of SB 94 I think
 
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
that would be devastating I think we
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
would see all the progress that we've
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
seen over the past couple years start to
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
erode because you would have law
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement not trusting the ability of
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the system to respond to community
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
safety when necessary and again it
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
almost never happens I hear of it
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
happening one or two times a year of a
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
kid who has less than three priors but
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
when it happens it's typically
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
short-term detention it's typically to
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that the family is safe
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
and that you have a safe place to have
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
that kid go and then within a couple
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
days you're able to work it out where
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
either the kids able to safely return
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
home or go to another family member or
 
00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
anything else the other thing that
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
impact this is that there's no ability
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
in our system to temporarily hold a
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
child anywhere other than detaining them
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
at sysc right you can't temporarily hold
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
a child in an adult a municipal facility
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
the laws around that are that kids can
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
only stay there for a matter of a couple
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
hours for processing and they need to
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
move to sysc so if you take this tool
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
away you don't even have the opportunity
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of let some the colder heels at
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
the county or at the local local jail
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
while you're working things out you just
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
take that totally away from the system
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
and then I have a couple other
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with the changes that start on
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
page seven regarding trauma-informed
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
care that's that's fine with me if this
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
was to go forward I do think there's an
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
error in the applicability at least on
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
the version that I was working on let me
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
double check if it's the same in this
 
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.750 align:start position:0%
double check if it's the same in this
version

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so page eight
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
line one talks about sections seven and
 
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.109 align:start position:0%
line one talks about sections seven and
eight

00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
applying to cases where a dispositional
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
order is not up in order section seven
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
was about the qualifications of the sysc
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
director so I don't think that's what
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
the intent was I think the intent was
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
for that to be eight and nine
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
not seven and eight and with that I am
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative welcome to you next thank
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%

thank you Commission
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
commissions a lot of information
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
could maybe write us a
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
that includes all the
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions and comments you had
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
I could I'm not I'm very busy and and it
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
will take me a minute but if that's
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
something that the committee would like
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
I I could do that I I didn't hear the
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
a summary of all the comments he's made
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
and all the corrections and
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
ideas he had for changes in the bill I
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
think they're significant and helpful
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy to if there's a work
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
session where folks want to go through
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
this I'm happy to sit through that too
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
um the uh the handout that you gave us
 
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
on the state of New Hampshire judicial
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
branch the the multi-page document where
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a page number but it's it
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
headlines detention assessment screening
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
instrument instructions
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
there's RSA cited there are specific
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
offenses cited uh I I I I see crime
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
levels those all look like criminal code
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
issues to me so my my question is that
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
since we formed a
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
a new general court in January of 23
 
00:55:40.569 --> 00:55:40.579 align:start position:0%
just a few weeks ago
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
bills in this area have been heard and
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
voted out 24 to nothing by the Senate
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
children and family law have looked at a
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
similar bill that they've retained
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
because they think they they want to be
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
able to work on it division three
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
finances has worked on it is this the
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
first time in this legislative session
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you've seen a specific Amendment or
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
discussion related to changing the
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses for which a juvenile
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
could be detained or committed yes
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you commissioner for
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
being here so this form that the
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uses is it spelled out
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
in statute for the judges to use this
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
form or is this a practice that they've
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
adopted that they could change so it's
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
not spelled out in statute but the
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
courts the courts instructor judges that
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
they have to use these forms when
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
they're doing these things and this was
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
this was originally written I don't know
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
tenor so years ago and then it was
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
updated with the Law changes that
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
occurred whenever that was 2018-ish to
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
that so you see that kind of section B
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
here that's to incorporate this stuff
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
from 2018 that occurred so it's
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with the law but the law
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically require that the
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
form be used thank you very much
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.890 align:start position:0%
and we'll look forward to you at work
sessions

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can can Mr ribson stick around
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%

he affirms that thank you sir and we'll
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%

bellander I'm from Epping former member
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
of the past legislative session
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you remember I stood before our
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
session and told you that I have
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm also the chair of the Juvenile
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
Justice Reform Commission which has
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm tired of watching this get punted
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
I look at the bills I pay attention and
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
what I see is very similar to Washington
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
DC it's not a clean bill
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
trash

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
we have been excuse me
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been looked at
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to build a
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art facility
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
a facility
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
not policy
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're getting there
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
through diversion programs that have
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
been established over the years we have
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
seen a decline in committed youth
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
we have what what's the census today
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
10. students
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
or juvenile offenders if you will
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
when I was there
 
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
when I was there
bull

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
they've all told you we want a facility
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
a new facility one that's home base
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
we had a work session and my first term
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
for the summer
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
where we heard so many solutions brought
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
someone had the audacity to recommend
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
how depressed do you think that that
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
student or juvenile offender would be if
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
he rolls up to Rockingham County jail
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
and sees all the barbed wire
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
not very
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
be very depressed
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that's before you is to
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
build a facility take the policy out of
 
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.490 align:start position:0%
build a facility take the policy out of
it

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
put the policy into a separate bill
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
18 bits
 
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
you've we've seen the numbers that's
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
what supports
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
we had a whole two years
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
when I was in the legislature
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to do to do this right and
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
here we are again
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 93 or 98 director last year
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me Senate bill 94.
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
provide a diversion
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
to prevent kids from even being arrested
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking about the habitual
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
offenders the 10 out of 10 offenders
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the kids with
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
low-level crime
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire a population of one
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
point almost 4 million people
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
we don't have very many high risk
 
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
we don't have very many high risk
offenders

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
but you can't just go to zero you'll
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
never be able to do that
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
we'll never be able to completely wipe
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
out not having a facility which has been
 
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.770 align:start position:0%
out not having a facility which has been
floated

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
floated
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
so then what
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to send these kids to
 
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.410 align:start position:0%
you're going to send these kids to
Massachusetts

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.730 align:start position:0%
 
Illinois

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
Illinois
 
01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.490 align:start position:0%
Illinois
Tennessee

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
article after article after article has
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
proven that kids are successful if only
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
one adult shows that they care about
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
these kids I am living proof that that
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
can happen I've sat on the other side of
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
this table because one person cared
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
about me enough and told me that they
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
loved me
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
when I thought the end was never going
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
now of course some of you might be
 
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
thinking I'm not going to listen to this
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
guy he didn't win
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
he's just on a soapbox
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody on the other side of the
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
screen watching
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
of the other 400.
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
but the opportunity to build a facility
 
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
that fits the need of the system of care
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
that we've been building for years even
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
before I became a legislator when I was
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to do that what we
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
need to focus on what I believe should
 
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
be the focus is the building and what
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
goes on and how it's built
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
not what goes on on the inside that
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
should not be the focus
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
that can be a focus for the second part
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the session
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
but the main focus
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
should be the studs the brick and the
 
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.069 align:start position:0%
should be the studs the brick and the
mortar

01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
mortar
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and I'm happy
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
members

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards all right thank
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um thank you uh
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
honorable Belanger hey I think I heard
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
you essentially testify that you're
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to zero six zero seven six seven
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
and if I heard you right as a former
 
01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:05.299 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that perhaps this bill
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
should be redirected over to Children
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
and Family Law so that they can consider
 
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
it as the policy committee
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Edwards for
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
the question as a member of a former
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
member of that committee I do believe
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
that if this is policy that's where that
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.730 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
members

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:39.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
other interested people I have seven
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
cards before me people wishing to
 
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.730 align:start position:0%
cards before me people wishing to
testify

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
testify
um

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
we've gone fairly long on many of these
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
people testifying so if there's
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
something that's mostly been said and I
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
see the majority of you are opposed to
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
the bill if you could just
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
not repeat repeat any of the testimony
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
we've heard but give your personal
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why you oppose the bill I would
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it may I ask for
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
clarification sir you're saying they're
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill or they're opposed
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
to this amendment I I just want to be
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
clear all I have is what's checked on
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights Center
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the disability
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
rights Center as well as on behalf of
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
the juvenile reform policy Group which
 
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:50.540 align:start position:0%
is an advocacy group comprised of
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center New Hampshire
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
legal assistance the ACLU of New
 
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.849 align:start position:0%
legal assistance the ACLU of New
Hampshire

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
um the um oh my goodness I'm gonna
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
forget Waypoint new Futures and the
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center of New Hampshire
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
and that those pink cards are
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
challenging so I mean if you don't color
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
well inside the lines so the position
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we're taking is this we fully
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
support the development of a replacement
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
facility for the sununu center however
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
we have issues with the amendment that's
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
under consideration right now and
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
concerns about those and that's what we
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
will highlight so I will limit my
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
testimony to a few of those issues and
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
then one of my colleagues who is much
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the juvenile
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
sentences and Provisions will address
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
those and I'll do my best to keep it
 
01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:41.870 align:start position:0%
those and I'll do my best to keep it
short

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.250 align:start position:0%
short
so

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
um with that clarification
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
the provision that I believe director
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
ribson did address has to do with staff
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
ratio it's section two
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
um Roman three
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
small letter J it's on page 24.
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so as the Director explained to you
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
there really aren't a lot of Standards
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
or accreditation for Juvenile Justice
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and what we look to are
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
things like the prison rape elimination
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
act or Priya which calls for a one to
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
eight ratio and I understand the way I
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
look at this provision
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's an effort to be in line
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
with this committee's responsibility
 
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:25.220 align:start position:0%
spending State dollars responsibly
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
but I also think the committee needs to
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire dollars responsibly
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
and with an eye towards how we can do
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that in a way that will ensure good
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes the best outcomes for kids who
 
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.020 align:start position:0%
are really vulnerable and in our state
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know with so few children who are in
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
this system eligible for commitment that
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
will do it in a way that these children
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
will come out better than when they went
 
01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:52.670 align:start position:0%
will come out better than when they went
in

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.049 align:start position:0%
in
so

01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:56.529 --> 01:07:56.539 align:start position:0%
you know we are not a state that
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
subjects kids to secure confinement when
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
they are when they shoplift graffiti do
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
minor crimes like we're talking about
 
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:09.020 align:start position:0%
some pretty serious offenses that are
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
causing kids to be ordered to a new new
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
center and there aren't very many of
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
them so when we're looking at economies
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
of scale here you know and and what's
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
required for these children they're
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to need adequate staff because
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
these are children with very serious
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
emotional issues very serious trauma
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
and behavioral challenges that are
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
what I think is that the only way that
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
this really small population of really
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
high-end challenging children could be
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
addressed with a ratio of like one to
 
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
eight would be essentially to keep kids
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
locked in their rooms because otherwise
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to have kids and staff in
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
unsafe situations
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's like putting kids into solitary
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
confinement that's not therapeutic
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's counter therapeutic it's not what
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
the goal is here the goal is to provide
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic evidence-based
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed treatment center for
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
these kiddos and can room confinement to
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
keep them safe because we don't have
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
adequate staff to supervise and engage
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
with them just shouldn't be an option
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
for this committee
 
01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
for this committee
um

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
the provision I don't really understand
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
is the following one letter k
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
um the Strategic downsides and
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
considerations I've really I'm baffled
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
by why it's there
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
um as I understand what this um
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
Council on juvenile Corrections
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
administrators did was they helped
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
develop a format for states that have
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%
multiple facilities to consider how they
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
can shut down facilities I didn't read
 
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
the information I was able to find
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
online to suggest that it would me it
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
would be for the closure of all
 
01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:52.819 align:start position:0%
facilities in a state and I think that
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Alvarez and Marcel report all the
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
community meetings that took place
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
really were in keeping with a lot of the
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I don't I guess I
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't understand why it's there the next
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
section that I want to address is the
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
the excuse me
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
the operating budget
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
I mean similarly to what my first point
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think what we're talking about here is
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
yes we have an obligation to spend State
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
dollars responsibly but we also need to
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
invest them responsibly and and Staffing
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
and numbers of children go hand in hand
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
um there is the provision requires a
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
budget that is I think commensurate with
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the average cost per child to operate a
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
similar Juvenile Justice Facility in New
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
England there aren't any
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
there just aren't
 
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.930 align:start position:0%
there just aren't
so

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:47.300 align:start position:0%
um our goal is to do something different
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
and and the operating budget the per
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
child operating budget is going to be
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
higher than it is to operate a Juvenile
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
jail essentially where your housing
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
40 50 80 100 children so when we're
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
talking about 12 children
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
it is going to cost more I mean there's
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
there's no way to hide that but we've
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
got to keep the needs of our children
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
front and center here their treatment
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
and safety needs and the goal that when
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
they leave this facility they'll be
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
better off than when they went in
 
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.729 align:start position:0%
better off than when they went in
so

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:22.739 --> 01:11:23.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's just it is going to be more
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
expensive to
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
for do you have an adequate operating
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
budget for students and children in a
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
facility that promotes healing and
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care while simultaneously
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
protecting the security and safety of
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
our communities and that's going to be
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
much more expensive than warehousing
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
children in a Juvenile Justice Facility
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
that houses many more lower level
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
offenders so for all these reasons the
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony you heard from director ripson
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
in particular I ask that you vote
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
against this proposed amendment and that
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
you support something more along the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
lines of what representative Edwards had
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
put forward in his Amendment and I'll
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
take any questions you might have
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.050 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
members

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you well next call on Susan
 
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:36.110 align:start position:0%
thank you well next call on Susan
Stearns

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Susan
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
Stearns I'm the executive director of
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire the National Alliance
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
on Mental Illness
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
the testimony that's being passed around
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
was actually written by our director of
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
public policy Holly Stevens who is
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
literally digging her way out of her
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
home still and unable to be here today
 
01:12:56.699 --> 01:12:58.669 align:start position:0%
home still and unable to be here today
so

01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
um Nami New Hampshire is a Grassroots
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
organization working to improve the
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
lives of all people impacted by mental
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
illness and suicide through support
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
education advocacy
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
um while we applaud the work of this
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
committee and I actually feel privileged
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
to have been in the room today to hear
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
the discussion and recognize
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire is such a leader in
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
this field I'm grateful that opportunity
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this amendment and I won't
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
go into detail you have heard clearly
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the concerns around sufficient funds
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
for the staffing ratio as well as
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the treatment does meet
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
the needs of these high need children I
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
will say we know that many of these
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
children have mental health challenges
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we know that statistically children
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
with mental health challenges are far
 
01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
more likely to wind up in our adult
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system so investment
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
Here and Now for these kiddos will
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately save us money long term as
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
well as well as probably lead to much
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for most of them
 
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions although
 
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
I really wish Holly were here to respond
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your brevity questions
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
from the committee members
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you well let's next call on Renee
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
um so this is actually going to be quick
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
because what I prepared was kind of
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
covered by everyone so uh but I wanted
 
01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
to thank you for recognizing yes I
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of give a practical
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
um uh opposition if you will so I am the
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
executive director of Dover Children's
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
Home I also sit on the Juvenile Justice
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
Reform Commission
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so we run a level two residential
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
treatment program which essentially is
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
community based so our kids go to school
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
in the community they work in the
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
community and they live in a home-based
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
environment we run our program uh
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion free and we have
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
for 17 years
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
however we are able to do that because
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
we run our program on a ratio of one to
 
01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.330 align:start position:0%
we run our program on a ratio of one to
three

01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
what this is asking for is a ratio of
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
one to eight if we line it up with Prius
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
standards which is completely
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate unsafe and absolutely will
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
never meet the treatment needs of Youth
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
questions from any committee members
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you well next call on
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
running honorable chair at members of
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Michelle
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
wongren I'm the youth Law Project
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
Director at New Hampshire legal
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
assistance and I'm also here testifying
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the juvenile reform policy
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
group as my colleague Karen Rosenberg
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned so I'm going to
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
focus my testimony today on the HB 254
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment so that would be Section 8 and
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
9 of the bill and
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved in in this project
 
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
redeveloping this new new center this
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
was a standalone Bill several years ago
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
and has been through the policy
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
committee several times well I think
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this is an improvement to some of
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
those earlier versions of the bill which
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
were very confusing I continue to have
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
some major concerns about both the bill
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
itself and also the need for the bill so
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
first of all I think that this needs to
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
be done separate from Redevelopment of
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
the student center and the reason for
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
that is because it doesn't actually
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
affect the census of the sununu center
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
as you heard from director there may be
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
one or two kids that it it could impact
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is that the way it's
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
morphed over time is that although their
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
um the initial provisions of the bill
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
try to limit the door to Serious violent
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
crime there are enough catch-alls now in
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
this version of the bill that my
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
perception is that it's a net zero it
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually do anything so what
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
what that leads me to do is if we're
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
writing legislation that does nothing we
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
have to be concerned about what harm it
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
will do and what we just heard from
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
director ribsum is very concerning there
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
has been great work with SB 94
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the the front door has been narrowed
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the sununu center in recent years not
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
because of closure
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
um of closing off the offenses but
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
because we have prioritized diversion
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that is a very real policy goal that
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
has had very real impact if we want to
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
further narrow the door I don't think
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the right way to do that is by by
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
closing the door but by building up the
 
01:17:51.169 --> 01:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
system of care those kids who are
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
first-time offenders committing domestic
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
violence offenses at home either against
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
their parents or their siblings we need
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
to build up the system of care to be
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
able to manage those kids in the
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
community if they are low-level
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
offenders we shouldn't just say well
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're not welcome at the sununu center
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
because because you have to go somewhere
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
else but where else do we where else do
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
we send them or better what services do
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
we provide to them are we sure that
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's mobile crisis services that are
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
effective enough to deal with that
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
situation if not let's look at that
 
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
because the reality is is that when kids
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
are determined to need commitment and
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
the door is closed to them
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
they don't go home they don't go to the
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
community-based services or the judges
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
would be ordering those community-based
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
Services instead where they go are out
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
of state facilities like Mill Creek and
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you and Mill Creek in Arkansas and
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at Mill Creek's website
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
they build themselves as a long-term and
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking like
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
nine to 18 months long-term treatment
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
facility for out-of-state students or
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state youth not even their own
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
youth but out of state youth why are we
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
sending kids to an out-of-state facility
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
that welcomes in out-of-state youth to
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
provide long-term treatment to them
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's not who we are as a state that's
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
not where we're going as a state and so
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
rather than looking at can we stop two
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
kids from going to the sununu center and
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
risk completely upending HB or SB 94
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
let's look at doing something meaningful
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
to these kids in the policy group where
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think that bill belongs and where that
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
work belongs so all of this to say is
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
that I strong I'm here strongly in
 
01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:42.140 align:start position:0%
support of amendment
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
804h and strongly against 767 age for
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
all of the reasons that you've heard
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
today I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
01:19:53.219 --> 01:19:55.130 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
Bruce

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
Bruce
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
we will next call on Cassandra Sanchez
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members and thank
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
you for my for your time today I will
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
share that I will keep it extremely
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
brief many of my colleagues before me
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
did share many of the concerns that I
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
have here I'm just going to focus as my
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
role as a child advocate for the state
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
is the best interests of these children
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
and keeping our children in New
 
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.290 align:start position:0%
and keeping our children in New
Hampshire

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
um so what I will share with you is my
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
concern for the statement around ratio
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the children and staff in the
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
facility I will share I had an
 
01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go out to Arkansas over
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
the summer and I had an opportunity to
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience their Treatment Center where
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
they house over a hundred youth in one
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
Center and in that sense as their
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
juvenile detention center and in their
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Detention Center
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
they had very low staff ratios and at
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
the time that I was visiting one of the
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
Cottages they had a ratio of two staff
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
to 12 children and what that resulted in
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
was what they called a cottage system
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that half of the
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the children were in their rooms for
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
half of the day while the other children
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
can move about the cottage then they
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
would take turns switching the other
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
half would be released they would move
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
about the cottage the other half would
 
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
remain in their rooms for for that time
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
period and the time that I was there
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
that because there were additional
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
um adults in the room they were allowed
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
to let the children out and so we had an
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with the children
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
in groups and what they shared was how
 
01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
that felt for them to be trapped they
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
shared the experience of feeling like
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
animals all day long and they did not
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
have any dignity and respect because
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
they were held in their rooms because
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
Staffing did not allow for any changes
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I was there with an advocate from
 
01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:50.219 align:start position:0%
Arkansas who was working diligently to
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
remove that Cottage system for these
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
kids because she recognized how damaging
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
that system was I do not want to see us
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
join in Arkansas and treat the children
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in that same way our
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
children deserve much more dignity and
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
respect and what they truly deserve is
 
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
treatment we understand these are
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
children with extremely high needs and
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
to be able to deliver trauma-informed
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
care and utilize a therapeutic
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
approaches that we would like to see in
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
the sununu center we need a new facility
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
that the building spaces trauma informed
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
and that the ra the ratios are similar
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
to what we just heard from Dover
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
Children's Home that therapeutic
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
approach we need to be looking at this
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
new facility and comparing it closer to
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
what our residential facilities look
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
like because those are the areas in the
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
state where our children get treatment
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to make the
 
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
necessary changes to be successful and
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
safe in the community and then they have
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
those opportunities to return to the
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
community and be successful
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
we have seen that work for our children
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so we need to look for that for the
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
new facility I will also share in my
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
time in Arkansas I had an opportunity to
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
visit Mill Creek in Arkansas I did visit
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that residential facility and under
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
and met with the children from New
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that reside there and I
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand as a state of New Hampshire
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
we send many children there what I will
 
01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
say is that is a practice that I would
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
like to see us be able to scale back on
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
and in doing that we need to ensure that
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
we have the appropriate Treatment
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
available here we are doing that through
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
building out the children's system of
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
care we need to continue to pour our
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
money and our efforts into that
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
community-based system so that we can
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
keep our children here and in programs
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
or in the community in New Hampshire it
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
is quite unfortunate to see that we are
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
sending children to a facility where
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
their own state will not send their
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
children there although they are
 
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
licensed they will not send their
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
children there because they hold
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
concerns for them and so realistically
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that even even our
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
children in the in juvenile justice
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
system we want to keep them here to get
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
treatment here so in the long run as
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
they as they moved into adulthood
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
they're not costing the system more
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
money on the other end when children
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity to get the
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment and reform we see
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
them costing more money in the adult
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
system and if it although it is a lot of
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
money we're asking up front now to
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
invest in our children we believe that
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
the long run outcome will be worth it
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you can you give us a number of
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children and why they were
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
sent there was it the court or was it
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
some other function I don't have the
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
exact number for today
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
um when I visited there were four
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
children there
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we do have times where there's more
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
or less children at the facility some
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
have been sent there because their needs
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
could not be met at a residential
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
facility in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
with again with building out the
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
children's system of care as well as
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
investing in Hampstead Hospital and a
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
level 5 prtf to be built at that
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
facility that can resolve some of this
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
issue and sending children to to out of
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
state but that a lot of it is that their
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
needs could not be met at the level of
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
programming here
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
so this was less confining than if we'd
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
I some of the some of the children that
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
I do understand that have gone to Mill
 
01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
Creek were eligible for the sununu
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
center um but ultimately
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
um they were able to with with great
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
advocacy on their end
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
um were able to go the route of
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
placement in a residential facility as
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
opposed to sununu Center
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I in the future if that if if we are
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
struggling with said Youth and they have
 
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
that level of charges and we know that
 
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
the new replacement facility is a
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
treatment facility where they're getting
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
adequate care and they have that option
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
or to go out of state the advocacy may
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
be otherwise the the attorneys that are
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
supporting these youth May advocate for
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
them to stay at sununu knowing that
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
they're getting the treatment that they
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
need and that's one of the reasons why
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
we need to have the facility that has
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
that approach in this state
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
members represent Edwards and
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
representative bucco so thank you Mr
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
chair I I just to let you know I think I
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
have three questions that may require a
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph answer so sorry
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
um because she's the state's child
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
advocate I just want to make sure I'm
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
clear on a few points
 
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:06.260 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
experienced senior legislators who have
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
proposed that if we do not have the
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
capacity at our new facility that we
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
ought to just be prepared to send
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
juveniles out of state what what what do
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
you think our position as a state ought
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
to be on the option of removing
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
our citizens to another state for
 
01:26:29.699 --> 01:26:31.310 align:start position:0%
our citizens to another state for
confinement

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's quite concerning to consider out of
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
state the option the solution as you
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
heard before me some are speaking about
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
families these children have families
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
they have connections to this state they
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
have friendships they have other
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
motivators to stay on track and to do
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the right thing and if we keep them in
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
their Community close to those
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
motivators then they have the success to
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
return back to their communities and to
 
01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair and similarly I've
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
heard from many of the same senior folks
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
that if we have a capacity issue at the
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
new facility and we end up with
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
additional placements that need to be
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
made that what that ought to do is
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
trigger sort of a mandatory release of a
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
resident prior to them having completed
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
their treatment what what what what do
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
you think the appropriate State position
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
ought to be relative to an artificially
 
01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
ought to be relative to an artificially
early

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment release of a resident who
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
is otherwise supposed to be at a at this
 
01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:37.669 align:start position:0%
is otherwise supposed to be at a at this
facility

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
those administrative releases need to
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
consider the clinical impact there is a
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
great clinical team that exists in the
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
current facility and there may be times
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
where an administrative releases a
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
conversation but they have a seat at
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
that table to say what needs to be in
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
place for that youth to be successful so
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
there may be times where the youth may
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
not be have completed their treatment at
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
the facility but there may be adequate
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
treatment options in the community that
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
they can transition to as long as that
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
is being explored in the clinical lens
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
is part of that conversation then that
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
could be reasonable but if it's
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
administrative release only for capacity
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
and not taking into account that child's
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
needs and treatment needs then that
 
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
could create a problem because that
 
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
could be a youth that's released too
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
early and will end up right back in the
 
01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.850 align:start position:0%
early and will end up right back in the
system

01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
follow up okay and I I've also sort of
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh and previous hearings heard people
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
bring up the the horrible history of the
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
sununu center relative to the abuse of
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
kids and uh the basic question you know
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
why would you know insanity is doing the
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
same thing over and expecting a
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
different result well I I is it your
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
understanding that we're what we're
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
proposing with these other amendments is
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
something fundamentally different than
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
what we've done historically in terms of
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh providing for the issues related to
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh that that's where the
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic trauma-informed care comes
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
in that is fundamentally different than
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
the way in which the facility was
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
operated in the past it takes skilled
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
staff who understand what these children
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
have experienced in their lives prior to
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
getting to the setting to uh to be able
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
to engage in that trauma-informed care
 
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
and so if we're looking for more skilled
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
staff hopefully salaries that match that
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
skill level will be getting staff that
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
can't adequately meet these children's
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
needs not staff who are are frustrated
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and burnt out within their positions and
 
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to deal with some
 
01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:38.780 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties that come with
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
managing their trauma in this setting
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
and settling into an Institutional like
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
setting so I do believe we have that in
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
place we also have the office of the
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
child advocate which did not exist at
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
that time and my office receives in real
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
time the any restraint and seclusion
 
01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's occurring or any incidents in
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
general that occur at the facility and
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
so we're able to look at those in real
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
time as they come in assess what has
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
happened and any concerns that we see
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
within the facility within specific
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
staff or specific children the ways in
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
which they're responding to those
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
children we can intervene early on
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
before it gets too far thank you Mr
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you Mr Sanchez thank you
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
representative Buco for a question
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Advocate
 
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
Sanchez this uh this Arkansas facility
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
with the cottage facility is this a
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
for-profit facility because that's what
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
it sounds like yes
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on that is is a for-profit
 
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.390 align:start position:0%
follow up on that is is a for-profit
facility

01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
um would that be adequate for the type
 
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.169 align:start position:0%
um would that be adequate for the type
of

01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:47.780 align:start position:0%
inmates or
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
people that need to be in this in this
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
facility I don't believe for-profit
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
should be an option on the table when
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a replacement for the
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
current sysc I believe what needs to be
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
state run it allows the level of
 
01:31:03.649 --> 01:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
oversight that we currently have in the
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
facility to ensure safety of the
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
children and it also allows for some of
 
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
those shared services as you as you've
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
heard from director ribsum and sharing
 
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
services with a facility like Hampstead
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
Hospital or um or new or um
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
the hospital in Concord so with the
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
shared services as well as the skill and
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
ability of the staff differs when you
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
take a look at at private versus
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit so I don't even believe that
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's something we should be bringing
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:43.610 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.890 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:02.990 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
dejoy

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
dejoy
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
I rise in full support
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
as I'm sitting listening to the
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
testimonies that I feel I remember Yogi
 
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.530 align:start position:0%
testimonies that I feel I remember Yogi
Berra

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
Berra
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
I remember Yogi Berra because this
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
really does feel like deja vu all over
 
01:32:22.679 --> 01:32:24.709 align:start position:0%
really does feel like deja vu all over
again

01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
um we I'm working on this issue for more
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
than a decade and I'm very proud of the
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
work that I've done
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
much of it with my former colleagues who
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard testify against this
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important
 
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't make a decision
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
because we're frustrated
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't make a decision
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
this is a decision that affects the
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
lives of currently all 12 children
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
now admittedly it's a low number
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
it may be the lowest in the country
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that's irrelevant for this
 
01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.010 align:start position:0%
but I think that's irrelevant for this
discussion

01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
because we're still talking about the
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
lies of 12 children
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the decisions you make today will
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
affect their lives
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
this is very much a financial Bill even
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
with the policy implications because the
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
policy implications go directly to the
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
census of the facility you've heard
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
people testify that that the sections
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
that are known as House Bill 254 would
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
have no impact on the census I disagree
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you if I'm wrong
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
two years from now I'll stand up here
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
and testify that I was wrong
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I am
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is not nor ever has been about a
 
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.930 align:start position:0%
this is not nor ever has been about a
building

01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
but most of the discussion over the last
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
decade and in the last two years has
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
focused on what the building's going to
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
look like how big the building's going
 
01:34:01.689 --> 01:34:01.699 align:start position:0%
to be how many beds there are
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
and we have very little conversation
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
there has been some today but very
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
little conversation about the treatment
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
children need
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that is and always should be our Focus
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest to this
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
incarcerating children is not in their
 
01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
we know that because research tells us
 
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.510 align:start position:0%
we know that because research tells us
that

01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
we also know the legislature understands
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
that because throughout the statutes it
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
says repeatedly least restrictive
 
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
says repeatedly least restrictive
alternative

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
children should not be incarcerated
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
unless it is the least restrictive
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
alternative but we've heard today lots
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
of reasons why children should be
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that are not least
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
I want to share some data that I've I
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
haven't I've
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
I've just tried to decide whether I
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
should share it or not this is data from
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
the department and I'm sure the
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
department can get you the full report
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
from 2021.
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
let's understand who these children are
 
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
let's understand who these children are
okay

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
we know from past testimony from the
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
Department that maybe 75 percent it's
 
01:35:19.729 --> 01:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
not my number
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the children have Behavioral Health
 
01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.689 align:start position:0%
of the children have Behavioral Health
needs

01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
many children have learning disabilities
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
many children live in poverty
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
what we've never talked about beyond
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
that who these kids are well the report
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.050 align:start position:0%
indicates that
most

01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
that many of these children are children
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm referring to the Department's
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
data this is I just printed out a few
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
pages which I can share I'd recommend
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
you get this from the Department not for
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
me but this looks at calendar year 2017
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
18 and 19 regarding Juvenile Justice
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
and in 2019
 
01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.870 align:start position:0%
and in 2019
17

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
of all arrests referred to the court
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're children of color
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
in that year children of color
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
represented 13 of the entire child
 
01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.450 align:start position:0%
represented 13 of the entire child
population

01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:25.460 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
but when you look at kids referred for
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
forty percent of the kids referred for
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
secure 37.9 percent of the kids referred
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
for secured attention are children of
 
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.350 align:start position:0%
for secured attention are children of
color

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
color
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
but yet they represent
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
a quarter of that
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
and 49.3 of all children committed to
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
the center of Youth Services Center are
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
We Believe very for there's a there is a
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
policy disagreement
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is affecting the budgeting and the
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
we believe that children who are
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at sununa Youth Services
 
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
Center or the replacement facility
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
should be kids who commit or are charged
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
with serious violent offenses
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
we believe the system of care exists
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
to treat the remainder of the children
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
who do not commit serious violent
 
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.490 align:start position:0%
who do not commit serious violent
offenses

01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
I have always argued to close the senior
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center lock it up and
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
throw away the key
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
through this process over the last
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
several years it has become clear that
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
there will be a small fraction of
 
01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.930 align:start position:0%
there will be a small fraction of
children

01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
who we need to have the ability to
 
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.189 align:start position:0%
who we need to have the ability to
incarcerate

01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
incarcerate
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
because of Public Safety or the
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
perception of Public Safety
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
but contrary to representative Lynn I do
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
not consider property crime
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be a serious violent offense I
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
consider to be an offense I consider it
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
something the child should be held
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
accountable for
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I consider it something that the
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
child should pay
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
compensation or provide service for I
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
incinitiative Services Center or any
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
other incarcerated setting
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about trauma-informed care which
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
is there's Universal agreement that is
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
the approach
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care begins with the
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
culture of the facility
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
when you folks
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
two decades ago decided to build this
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
new Services Center part of the reason
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
was that YDC
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
was having significant issues with
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
also had a very high recidivism rate
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
you folks decided to build a snowy
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
Services Center which you were assured
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
at the time by the people who aren't
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the treatment would be better at
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
this in Union Services Center
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
and we picked up YDC and moved it to
 
01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:27.709 align:start position:0%
and we picked up YDC and moved it to
sysc

01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we had the same issues at sysc
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
as we had at YDC
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
I believe the number today is more than
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
a thousand children have alleged sexual
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
you have a generational decision before
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
you once this is decided we won't
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
revisit this for at least a decade and
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably two
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to take steps
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the facility that it
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
replaces this
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's today tomorrow or next year
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
is an optimal treatment facility for
 
01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.149 align:start position:0%
is an optimal treatment facility for
children

01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this amendment does it adds
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
prevents children who who don't commit
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
serious violent offenses from being
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or detained
 
01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:26.699 align:start position:0%
and adds pieces to explain what
 
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care is and to try to
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
put safeguards in place to make sure
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
that charm and Ford care is actually
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
what is delivered
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
I can go through the 254 pieces line by
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
line event we would like me to I've done
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
that before this committee a couple
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
times in the past some of you weren't
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
here many of you were I will remind the
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee this was part of the budget
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
when you all had the courage to set a
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
closure date for sysc
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
now we had to push out the closure date
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
but the only reason we're here having
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
those conversations because you had the
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
courage to do that
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to have the courage to
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
disc continue disagreeing with the
 
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.629 align:start position:0%
disc continue disagreeing with the
Senate

01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
to move forward with what is truly going
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
to help children
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
and worry less about what the facility
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
looks like and what the treatment
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
delivered inside the facility consists
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
of we think this amendment does that
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to support the
 
01:41:25.739 --> 01:41:26.810 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to support the
amendment

01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:30.659 align:start position:0%
I would say representative rice
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to be here
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
she was unable to be here because she's
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
still stuck in her driveway she did
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
submit testimony electronically and has
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
I could keep going Mr chairman I won't
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
but there were a lot of things said
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
previously that I normally would comment
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
on I think I'd like to focus my
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
testimony as I have that this is a
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
generational decision and it's in your
 
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.750 align:start position:0%
generational decision and it's in your
hands

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
hands
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll support this amendment
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
which Builds on the work of
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
Representative Edwards in the Senate and
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
adds important pieces to it to fully
 
01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:14.780 align:start position:0%
flesh out what this facility ought to
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%

funny question today I represent myself
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%

I do not have a client that's asked me
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
to represent them on this issue thank
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.330 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
representative

01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
my questions I just have two
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
um does this amendment take a position
 
01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
on sending children out of state
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative in fact nothing in this
 
01:43:05.699 --> 01:43:06.910 align:start position:0%
representative in fact nothing in this
amendment

01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
specifies a particular standard for for
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
Staffing Nora does it contemplate
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
sending children on a state we we agree
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
that sending children out of state is a
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
last leased alternative and as I
 
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand it it's typically done today
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
for Unique types of treatment needs that
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
the state does not have the ability to
 
01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
offer in state I would say further that
 
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
we actually looked at the Prius
 
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.370 align:start position:0%
we actually looked at the Prius
standards

01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
and rejected the priest energy of heard
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
the one to eight we don't believe that's
 
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.590 align:start position:0%
the one to eight we don't believe that's
reasonable

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
so it was an intent that St that
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
statement was an intent to address what
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
is seen as a bloated budget
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
for this facility
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
if it's causing more confusions
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
um by all means remove it
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
however it does not refer to the prehist
 
01:43:56.219 --> 01:43:57.890 align:start position:0%
however it does not refer to the prehist
standards

01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
all right follow up thank you
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
and are there non-detension facilities
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
so the system of care as I understand it
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to be speaking out of turn
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
because this is not my expertise Mr
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
ribsum can speak to this more expertly
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
than I can but the system of care
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
provides a number of types and
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
intensities of care as I understand it
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
there are group homes which are go up to
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
a level four type group home which based
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
on the contracts can deal with children
 
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
who are adjudicated
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
um so yeah there are there are and
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're technically considered
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
non-secure I believe
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for uh Mr dejoy for
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question I
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I it it's my impression that one of
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
the reasons that there hasn't been as
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
much dialogue this term as opposed to
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
previous terms but in this term about
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
the the operations of the facility is
 
01:45:09.609 --> 01:45:09.619 align:start position:0%
because there's just
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
devastatingly broad consensus that we're
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
trying to build an entirely new model
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
here a therapeutic model that's
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed and since there's not
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
really been any disagreement on that I
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's been much
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
discussion on it the discussion for
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
quite a while has been focused on
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
something very specific and and my
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
um the the specific issue has been the
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
maximum capacity of the facility there
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
were advocates for six then there were
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
advocates for 12 with the potential of
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
going up to 18 should a exigent reason
 
01:45:49.199 --> 01:45:50.810 align:start position:0%
going up to 18 should a exigent reason
exist

01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
what is your position on the maximum
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
capacity do you have a number that you
 
01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
would tell us
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and just to
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
start I reject the premise that this
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
broad consensus there is Broad consensus
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
regarding trauma-informed care and I can
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know right after you folks set a
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
closure date I met with the commissioner
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the director with a number of other
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
Advocates and the commissioner asked me
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
the very same question how many beds do
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
you want
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
my answer then is the same as it is now
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
the number of beds is relevant
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's the number of children who are
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
incarcerated there that's relevant to me
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
and the treatment that those kids who
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
are there received that's what's
 
01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:37.970 align:start position:0%
are there received that's what's
relevant

01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none will next hear from The
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Neil
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
Kirk I live in Ware and I'm representing
 
01:47:05.699 --> 01:47:07.450 align:start position:0%
Kirk I live in Ware and I'm representing
myself

01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:07.460 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
as others who have spoken I've been
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
involved with this issue for at least
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and I can see it's finally coming to
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
I support
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment 767.
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
because it's a comprehensive
 
01:47:29.159 --> 01:47:31.189 align:start position:0%
because it's a comprehensive
compromise

01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
that re deals and resolves the sununu
 
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.330 align:start position:0%
that re deals and resolves the sununu
issue

01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
at least for the next decade
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
if you look at the co-sponsors and
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
these folks got together and they came
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
up with a comprehensive solution and
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
what does that do
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
first of all it builds the replacement
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
facility 12 to 18 18 beds but staffed
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
for 12.
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
appropriates 21.4 million dollars to do
 
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.450 align:start position:0%
appropriates 21.4 million dollars to do
this

01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:10.370 align:start position:0%
this
secondly

01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to repeat the
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
disastrous history of YDC and sununu
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to abuse situations it puts
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
in place a different philosophy a
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
different culture of how this operation
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be run you've heard it
 
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:31.139 align:start position:0%
mentioned trauma-informed care
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
the director is required to have certain
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
criteria and staff members are required
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
to implement certain criteria so that
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
the children will be receiving the care
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
that they need here and the staff
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
will not be the kind of Staff who
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
staffed YDC and sununu it will be a
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
different breed of person with different
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
training and that's very important we
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat what's happened in
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.129 align:start position:0%
 
thirdly

01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment puts into effect what
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
this house over years has decided is
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
important and it's been referred to in
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
the offenses for which
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
commitment detention at sununu are
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
further Limited
 
01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
if you look at the charts that the
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
department is presented you'll see that
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
the census tsunu has dropped from 120 to
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
12 over the past five eight years and
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's largely not exclusively but
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
largely because of the statutory changes
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
because the philosophy of this house has
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
been children should receive treatment
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
in the community rather than in the
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
facility and it's only for the most
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous children
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
this comprehensive solution includes
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
that so there will be a further
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
reduction we believe in the number of
 
01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:03.229 align:start position:0%
reduction we believe in the number of
children

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
who are committed or detained in the
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
replacement facility
 
01:50:12.530 --> 01:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
it's true that the current house has not
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
acted on this
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
but if you look back at the at the years
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
and the various children and fat youth
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
family law committee actions you'll see
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
that it's consistent in this area let's
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
put only the most difficult children
 
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
put only the most difficult children
violent

01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
violent
 
01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
children into this kind of a secure
 
01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:36.350 align:start position:0%
children into this kind of a secure
facility

01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
fourthly with respect to budgets there's
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
been some discussion today of those and
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps a reminder of how the
 
01:50:46.129 --> 01:50:46.139 align:start position:0%
budget process works would be helpful
 
01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.390 align:start position:0%
budget process works would be helpful
um

01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
let's call them
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines about Staffing using some
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
sort of regional average
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
remember how and I'm sorry to have to
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
say this publicly but I think the P some
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the people testify need to hear this
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you folks don't
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things when you put something
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
in statute is that the department when
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that It prepares its budget has to
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow the statute
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
so this committee is going to get a
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
budget for the replacement facility
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
based on the criteria in this bill
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
it won't be Priya
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
that was a red herring it will be
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
whatever standards are used now you've
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
also heard some information which
 
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
suggests these standards the average
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
don't make sense
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
and guess what that's the purpose of the
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
finance committee the department will
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
come in and present a budget that
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
represents what the statute requires
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
they will also because this committee
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
will ask them certainly division three
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
will will ask them well is this adequate
 
01:51:54.590 --> 01:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
do you need more and then director
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
ribsum or his replacement if this
 
01:51:57.970 --> 01:51:57.980 align:start position:0%
happens in the future
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
will come before you and say look our
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
facility has a relatively small number
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
of children
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
and these children are much more in need
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
of or much more dangerous perhaps than
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
in other facilities so our staffing
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
ratios cannot be the average and he will
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
make his case
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
and you will evaluate that
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
so the actual budget is not going to be
 
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
determined by the language here
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
this language only talks about what is
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee what the
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
governor will present in his budget what
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
the department will present in its
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
budget but you will make the ultimate
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
decision and I'm quite sure it's going
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
to reflect the reality that you can't
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a very small number of Staff
 
01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
members for this these kinds of children
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
this bill a comprehensive solution gets
 
01:52:58.209 --> 01:52:58.219 align:start position:0%
this new new issue off the table
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
and resolved and for those folks like
 
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn who have a
 
01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:05.540 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
or the department which has some
 
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.109 align:start position:0%
or the department which has some
concerns

01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:53:11.689 --> 01:53:11.699 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned there is House Bill 120
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
where these issues can be worked out and
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
any changes that that body feels are
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
necessary made
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's important that we take a major step
 
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
forward not just simply put into a place
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
a building but also the comprehensive
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
part that is this
 
01:53:30.659 --> 01:53:34.370 align:start position:0%
part that is this
767.

01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that Advocates and lobbyists
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
raised can be handled in 120. but right
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
now you've got a very comprehensive
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
package that deserves to go forward
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
there were some technical corrections I
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
understand that need to be made but
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
beyond those this is really a solid
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation thank you Mr
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be pleased to answer any
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
members representative McGuire
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
Kirk

01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to go along with your
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
position but I want to ask you about
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
possible other sort of negative
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
consequences of reducing the population
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
even more severely that it's already
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
been reduced
 
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
so in my mind one of the reasons we have
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
um commitment or incarceration or
 
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.669 align:start position:0%
um commitment or incarceration or
whatever

01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:39.659 align:start position:0%
is a consideration for the victims of
 
01:54:39.659 --> 01:54:41.090 align:start position:0%
is a consideration for the victims of
crimes

01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.649 align:start position:0%
crimes
that

01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
that we remove criminals from their
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
presence so that they will not be
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
further victimized
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
and is there any
 
01:54:54.729 --> 01:54:54.739 align:start position:0%
do you think there's any concern here
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
that by having by releasing or not
 
01:54:58.679 --> 01:55:00.830 align:start position:0%
that by having by releasing or not
committing

01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
committing
 
01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:01.570 align:start position:0%
committing
um

01:55:01.570 --> 01:55:01.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
children who juveniles who don't who
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
commit crimes that we will expose the
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
public to further crimes and further
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
victim victimization thank you thank you
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
for that question representative McGuire
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a danger but that's a
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
danger at whatever level or whatever
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
standard you use for commitment
 
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be an important
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
factor taken into consideration when
 
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
children are committed to the sununu
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
center but it is certainly a risk and I
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill or any bill is
 
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
really going to be able to answer that
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
unless you want to take the position
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
which I know you don't and I certainly
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't that all children who commit
 
01:55:47.169 --> 01:55:47.179 align:start position:0%
just about any kind of inappropriate
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
abusive activity should go to some sort
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
of facility like the sununu center which
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
had 144 beds at its maximum and I think
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've all agreed over the decades that
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
that is not the right place for most of
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Edwards
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I don't want to
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
refer to it as 254 because that's a dead
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill from a previous era but I will
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
refer to zero seven six seven sections
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
eight and nine I believe your testimony
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
was that these items have not been heard
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
yet anywhere in the senate or in the
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
house and that this is the first time
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
this topic has been introduced
 
01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:38.900 align:start position:0%
um would you would you believe that
 
01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:42.659 align:start position:0%
both the current chairman and current
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
Vice chair representing our two great
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
parties have both independently and
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
collectively told me that they want
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
since they've retained HP 120 they want
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
to bring sections eight and nine into
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
their process because they're the policy
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
committee and this is Major policy would
 
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
you believe one that they've told me
 
01:57:09.010 --> 01:57:09.020 align:start position:0%
that at and and two if you accept that
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we respect uh their opinion on
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
what's in their jurisdiction and what is
 
01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.209 align:start position:0%
what's in their jurisdiction and what is
not

01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:20.300 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I certainly
 
01:57:23.089 --> 01:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
accept your characterization I have no
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
reason to to doubt it
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
um but I would say this
 
01:57:27.239 --> 01:57:29.810 align:start position:0%
um but I would say this
um

01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
while the legislature each year is new
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
and each year can undo whatever has been
 
01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
done in the past and there's no
 
01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
certainty in that
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
this house as a body does have a history
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
and the history is 254 which is my
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
shorthand for sections eight and nine
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
it's most appropriate for this body
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
to recognize that history
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
included in this bill recognizing that
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
there is another bill House Bill 120
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
which is before that committee which
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
next year and they've retained it and
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
which next year they can work on it and
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
if and in fact they decide that these
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
things need to be changed and I my guess
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
is that because the house has been so
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
consistent over the years in doing this
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
that they will make some slight tweaks
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
but not change the basic policy that
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
this ha this body can go ahead with
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
in relative comfort that it is doing the
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
advancing the policy positions of this
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
house and its children and family law
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
answer

01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Miller
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
I've you know we've listened to a lot of
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
testimony and personally I'm really
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
conflicted here because on one hand this
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
seems to be a generally a good direction
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
but there have been a lot of concerns
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
raised about the language and the
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
possible side effects and undesired
 
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
consequences of some of those
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know changes and you were saying
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
earlier that any concerns about this
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
could be addressed by the policy
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee my question to you is
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
you know why would this committee not
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
just focus on just the dollars and you
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
know hope that the policy committee will
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
include this language that we are
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
proposing in this amendment and fix you
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
know the possible concerns so basically
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
this is still contains policy this bill
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
and this is the finance committee so I'm
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to get your you know
 
01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
take on this
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that
 
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
certainly is one reasonable approach
 
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
but I'd point out to you that Amendment
 
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
804 and some of the other amendments
 
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't deal exclusively with the building
 
01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
and its funding there's trauma-informed
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
care in these is that a policy decision
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
which we should wait and send back to uh
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
children and family law in 120 I think
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we go ahead
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
with a comprehensive solution
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
and nobody is ever going to get it right
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
the first second or third time and we
 
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
will polish it next session with 120 and
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
the following session of the legislature
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
it will be further refined because we
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
can always make things better
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we take a
 
02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
significant step now rather than try to
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
do this thing piecemeal because
 
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
piecemeal sometimes creates more
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
problems than a comprehensive solution
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
which can be amended in the future
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie thank you Mr
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
question nice to see you
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
same here sir is there is there a danger
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
of uh these juveniles sidestepping the
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
juvenile just uh Juvenile Justice System
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
you see in uh on our Southern border
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
they use juveniles because they know
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:01:03.609 --> 02:01:03.619 align:start position:0%
punishment or whatever
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
care whatever you want to call it is a
 
02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
care whatever you want to call it is a
problem

02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie um
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
like you I've probably watched enough
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
television programs over the decades to
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
know that in police dramas it's a common
 
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
constant to use juveniles as various
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
a Bettors Lookouts
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
mules because everyone knows that no
 
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
matter what the state juveniles receive
 
02:01:35.209 --> 02:01:35.219 align:start position:0%
different treatment
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that issue is
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
determinative of this bill
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
I think that issue will be here no
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
matter what happens
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the extent that these juveniles are
 
02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:50.219 align:start position:0%
in fact extremely violent
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
then this bill deals with those and they
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
will be properly committed detained
 
02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you Mr
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
there had been a plan if the time
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
permitted to do work session on this
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
obviously there isn't it's noon we have
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
a we're coming back here at one to exec
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
several bills
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
for full committee so let's have a lunch
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
if I may real quickly
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
um only because simple assault came up I
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
want everybody on the committee to
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
understand there's a 2006 New Hampshire
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
that was prosecuted by ayotte
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember the name of it but
 
02:02:52.729 --> 02:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
it had to do with the definition of
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
simple assault and it was where one
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
attorney on leaving the courtroom pushed
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
another attorney with their thumb
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
against the shoulder
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
and that wrote that case went all the
 
02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
way to the Supreme Court and simple
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
assault is taking your thumb and pushing
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
someone else's shoulder I I want us to
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
understand the legal definition when we
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
start talking about some of these things
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
because there is a there is a criminal
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
element in all of this
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that is not the same as some of the
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
serious crimes that we hear thank you
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%

02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
and there also will be some written
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that you can read that has
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
been submitted online uh we'll ask Mr

02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
are and whether or not it's going to be
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%

02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:27.650 --> 03:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
agreement all right committee members
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
each of you has received a packet of
 
03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:35.150 align:start position:0%
each of you has received a packet of
bills

03:02:35.150 --> 03:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:02:37.010 --> 03:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
you may not have all the same bills as
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
you should have the bills already in
 
03:02:46.309 --> 03:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
your possession for your division
 
03:02:48.769 --> 03:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
the bills you have in this packet are
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
for the divisions that you're not in
 
03:02:53.690 --> 03:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
because you need to be familiar with
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
those when we exec them
 
03:02:59.389 --> 03:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
we have a deadline on
 
03:03:03.170 --> 03:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
49 House Bill 49 tomorrow
 
03:03:05.330 --> 03:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
so since we had a work session and it
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
went right up to lunchtime and I decided
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
to stop then and have lunch
 
03:03:14.570 --> 03:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to proceed forward and try
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
to get something passed on 49 since it
 
03:03:19.070 --> 03:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
has a deadline
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
so we had discussions this morning on
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
our on our Amendment 767
 
03:03:29.090 --> 03:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
and there were some weaknesses and I'm
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to discuss those with two other
 
03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
chairmen the chairman of Judiciary who's
 
03:03:36.530 --> 03:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
here representative Lynn and the
 
03:03:39.849 --> 03:03:39.859 align:start position:0%
chairman of Children and Family Law
 
03:03:43.370 --> 03:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson so first I'll
 
03:03:45.830 --> 03:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
allow representative Lynn to briefly
 
03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment and if we've
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about what it's going to do
 
03:03:51.170 --> 03:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go into the too much
 
03:03:52.849 --> 03:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
detail I hope
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.889 --> 03:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
the committee and what I I guess I try
 
03:04:05.090 --> 03:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
to make is really very brief because I
 
03:04:06.290 --> 03:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
would just be repeating what I said
 
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
earlier the amendment that I have
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
proposed and which I guess would would
 
03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
need to be introduced by a member of
 
03:04:14.330 --> 03:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
um which I'm not on but uh it's eight
 
03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's 892 and and what I would say is
 
03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:22.550 align:start position:0%
it's 892 and and what I would say is
892

03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
892
 
03:04:27.050 --> 03:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same literally word for
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
word as 767 except that
 
03:04:34.969 --> 03:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
it adds it adds a new
 
03:04:37.490 --> 03:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
section eight
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
to the bill and then renumbers what
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
comes after Section 8 in 767 renumbers
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
it so that there's when you get to the
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
end there's one more section and in the
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
section eight
 
03:04:52.849 --> 03:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
which is what's new
 
03:04:55.730 --> 03:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
it just makes a two-word change it it it
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
it deals with
 
03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 169 b14 which is a section of the
 
03:05:04.490 --> 03:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice Act
 
03:05:06.650 --> 03:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
that that talks that deals with
 
03:05:06.660 --> 03:05:07.730 align:start position:0%
that that talks that deals with
detention

03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
detention
 
03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
and it basically adds the words
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh quote or 169 B colon 19 1
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
parenthesis M close parenthesis and the
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
purpose of that is simply to make to
 
03:05:24.889 --> 03:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
03:05:26.990 --> 03:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
since you're since you're creating the
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
section m in 19 as an as another basis
 
03:05:30.960 --> 03:05:32.030 align:start position:0%
section m in 19 as an as another basis
for

03:05:32.030 --> 03:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
commitment I think you need to make the
 
03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
change to 14 so that it's consistent so
 
03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:38.090 align:start position:0%
change to 14 so that it's consistent so
that

03:05:38.090 --> 03:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know it I I completely agree with
 
03:05:42.530 --> 03:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
the idea that somebody shouldn't be able
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
to be detained for an offense that they
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't be committed for but since
 
03:05:49.130 --> 03:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
you're now saying well you can be
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
committed for M it seems to me you have
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
to change 14 to be consistent so I guess
 
03:05:57.530 --> 03:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that that's that's
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
really the the sum and substance of the
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm happy to answer any
 
03:06:01.200 --> 03:06:02.210 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm happy to answer any
questions

03:06:02.210 --> 03:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:06:08.929 --> 03:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.010 --> 03:06:12.020 align:start position:0%
where is their Chief questioner
 
03:06:13.540 --> 03:06:13.550 align:start position:0%
oh there he is
 
03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:21.309 align:start position:0%
oh there he is
[Music]

03:06:21.309 --> 03:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:06:28.370 --> 03:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.010 --> 03:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
there were some thought earlier that
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason we had a a
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
specific hearing for the previous
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
um amendment was because it was getting
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
into policy areas and it was a little
 
03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
non-germaine to the what the original
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 was now we know you have
 
03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 120 and I believe you have
 
03:06:58.370 --> 03:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
retained it with the thought that if
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
there was something that needed more
 
03:07:02.690 --> 03:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
work on what we might pass here today
 
03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
because we're on a cup on a deadline
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
that you could put it in 120
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
which you've retained and then bring it
 
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
back in January does that sound
 
03:07:13.319 --> 03:07:14.269 align:start position:0%
back in January does that sound
reasonable

03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:07:17.450 --> 03:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.530 --> 03:07:20.540 align:start position:0%
Amanda if you want to send us Amendment
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
767 our way to we'll be working on this
 
03:07:26.090 --> 03:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh individuals have already been so
 
03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
excited about it that they're starting
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
to ask questions all over the place and
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think they're going to do it
 
03:07:34.250 --> 03:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
what's on our summer vacation list but
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we would be very happy to take up
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh 120 with this 767 Amendment or
 
03:07:43.070 --> 03:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
anything else you care to send us this
 
03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:44.570 align:start position:0%
anything else you care to send us this
policy

03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you that that helps us try to get
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
49 out of here today so it can make the
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
the deadline
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
all right division three chair how do
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I think we have zero zero seven six
 
03:08:11.929 --> 03:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
seven in in in in the Lynn amendment I I
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
think they are slightly competing uh I I
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
would like to move actually uh that we
 
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
accept the Lynn Amendment
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and I I
 
03:08:29.690 --> 03:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
that motion would need to be seconded
 
03:08:35.830 --> 03:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich seconds the
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
motion to pass Amendment zero eight nine
 
03:08:44.809 --> 03:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
two H for house bill 49.
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
further questions from many committee
 
03:08:46.859 --> 03:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
further questions from many committee
members

03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that there are not
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
so everybody seems to understand what
 
03:08:57.170 --> 03:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn made the changes
 
03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
to this amendment that he spoke of this
 
03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:02.210 align:start position:0%
to this amendment that he spoke of this
morning

03:09:02.210 --> 03:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:09:14.450 --> 03:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
as you heard we also have another shot
 
03:09:20.690 --> 03:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
at 120 so anything that we Overlook now
 
03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully can go forward in 120 and be
 
03:09:30.650 --> 03:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:37.389 --> 03:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
Joe ripsom director dcyf
 
03:09:43.490 --> 03:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate representative Lynn
 
03:09:44.809 --> 03:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
was trying to do with this amendment in
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
terms of reconciling the detention and
 
03:09:48.290 --> 03:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
the commitment changes my biggest
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
concern in the immediate term is that if
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
eight and nine become law and become
 
03:09:55.730 --> 03:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
applicable before 120 fixes them right
 
03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
because for some reason it seems like
 
03:09:59.450 --> 03:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
we're deciding to move the policy
 
03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
through here and then fix it later
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
instead of actually fixing the policy
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
before we move it through
 
03:10:07.010 --> 03:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
if those become law immediately they
 
03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
will undermine SB 94 which is wildly
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
successful in a national model today
 
03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
and that would be devastating how will
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
they underline it because you will
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
change the incentives of law enforcement
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
to be willing to accept our
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations to not send kids to
 
03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:23.929 align:start position:0%
recommendations to not send kids to
court

03:10:23.929 --> 03:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
what will happen instead is law
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement will be afraid that if they
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't stack up three prior charges for
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
things like domestic violence and simple
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
assault that those kids will then not be
 
03:10:35.809 --> 03:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
able to be eligible to be detained in
 
03:10:37.250 --> 03:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
case it becomes necessary in the future
 
03:10:40.010 --> 03:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
and will be more likely to say we're
 
03:10:41.889 --> 03:10:41.899 align:start position:0%
going to charge these kids each time
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
instead of letting them be deferred
 
03:10:45.769 --> 03:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
which is what's happening today with
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
wild success under SB 94 the other thing
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
that will happen that happens today with
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think great success is kids who are
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
currently on probation
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
they typically don't get new charges
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
they just get violated on probation and
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
the court brings them back you know
 
03:11:01.969 --> 03:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
reads them the riot act whatever but
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
they don't get new charges with this
 
03:11:06.050 --> 03:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
change you're going to incentivize that
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
those kids stack up new charges so
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
you've really changed the process by
 
03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
which folks are going to have to make
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
their decision about whether or not to
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
bring charges and the entire system
 
03:11:19.370 --> 03:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
we've built in the past couple years is
 
03:11:21.530 --> 03:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
not just around keeping kids out of sysc
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's about keeping them out of the
 
03:11:24.769 --> 03:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
system as a whole not bringing charges
 
03:11:27.230 --> 03:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
at all and what this is going to do is
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
incentivize the exact opposite behavior
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement and prosecutors
 
03:11:32.090 --> 03:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
when they're worried about maintaining
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
Community safety
 
03:11:36.230 --> 03:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay and we're gonna let Judge Lynn
 
03:11:39.050 --> 03:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
respond my experience was when we asked
 
03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:40.130 align:start position:0%
respond my experience was when we asked
the

03:11:40.130 --> 03:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
County attorney to give us a list of of
 
03:11:46.370 --> 03:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
the cases they had virtually everybody
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was arrested had five charges
 
03:11:51.530 --> 03:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
against them I was always resisting
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
arrest attempting to leave and all this
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
kind of thing nobody ever got arrested
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
for one thing and and if it was if you
 
03:12:01.849 --> 03:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
had if they had any drugs it was intent
 
03:12:04.610 --> 03:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
to distribute possession all those
 
03:12:06.290 --> 03:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
things everything got added on to it so
 
03:12:07.969 --> 03:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know is that would be any
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
different when they arrest because it
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be a pattern anyway so this
 
03:12:15.469 --> 03:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
this this requires that there'd be three
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
separate incidents not multiple charges
 
03:12:19.849 --> 03:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
on a single incident right so that's
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually not not the circumstance that
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you could have three
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
separate incidents of 10 charges each
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
but they'd have to be three separate
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
incidents in here it's not just one
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
incident with multiple charges and it's
 
03:12:31.490 --> 03:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
three separate incidents that have been
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
proven or adjudicated within a 12-month
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
period so again I don't think it
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
meaningfully changes the census of who's
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
at sysc because when we look at that the
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
kids who actually get detained and
 
03:12:44.090 --> 03:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
committed have dozens unfortunately a
 
03:12:46.969 --> 03:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
prior incidence but what it will do is
 
03:12:48.769 --> 03:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
meaningfully impact the decisions that
 
03:12:50.450 --> 03:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in law enforcement make on
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
the ground about whether to bring a
 
03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
charge in the first place and that's
 
03:12:54.650 --> 03:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
what I'm really worried about more than
 
03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
what I'm really worried about more than
anything

03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Lynn yeah uh
 
03:13:00.530 --> 03:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members committee I guess I
 
03:13:02.330 --> 03:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say so because I don't
 
03:13:05.450 --> 03:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
want the committee to misinterpret my
 
03:13:05.460 --> 03:13:06.410 align:start position:0%
want the committee to misinterpret my
position

03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
when when I offered Amendment 892 with
 
03:13:12.290 --> 03:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
the change that I explained a moment ago
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
I did that after discussions with
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
because because basically what what I
 
03:13:22.010 --> 03:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
said to him and what I say to this
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee is if you're gonna Inc if
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
you're gonna include
 
03:13:29.809 --> 03:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
the the the changes that are now in
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
sections eight and nine of of amendment
 
03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
767. if you're gonna do that
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
then I hope you will consider my
 
03:13:40.250 --> 03:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment instead which which makes the
 
03:13:43.130 --> 03:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
change to section 14. but
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's really sort of my fallback
 
03:13:48.530 --> 03:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
position if you will I agree completely
 
03:13:52.130 --> 03:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
with with Mr ribson but I I think that
 
03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
the best if the committee wants to know
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the best thing to do here at least
 
03:13:58.190 --> 03:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it would be just
 
03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
don't take that 254 language the eight
 
03:14:01.740 --> 03:14:02.809 align:start position:0%
don't take that 254 language the eight
nine

03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
nine
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
Section 8 and 9 out of this completely
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
don't deal with that at all let that go
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
to child and family I think that would
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
be the ideal resolution that's what I
 
03:14:15.889 --> 03:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
would suggest suggest but that's in in
 
03:14:18.889 --> 03:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
your Amendment though no it isn't
 
03:14:21.130 --> 03:14:21.140 align:start position:0%
it's not 254 language
 
03:14:25.010 --> 03:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
my language includes the the 254
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
language that is was in representative
 
03:14:28.849 --> 03:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
Earth's and representative holds
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it added that one other
 
03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
section I talked about before I guess as
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
I said my position I guess my view is if
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna
 
03:14:41.929 --> 03:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
you know pass the 254 as part of this
 
03:14:44.809 --> 03:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
bill then please include
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know please do it via my Amendment
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the 767 Amendment but I
 
03:14:52.370 --> 03:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
would prefer I would think the better
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
thing to do is not not pass not include
 
03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
the 267 uh the 254 language at all
 
03:15:05.210 --> 03:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair I representative if I may I
 
03:15:09.410 --> 03:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
would like to change my motion and my
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
motion would be and I hopefully the
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
person who seconded will support this I
 
03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
would like to have both zero eight nine
 
03:15:21.050 --> 03:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
two zero seven six seven both retained
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that children and family law can
 
03:15:27.230 --> 03:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
consider it as part of HB 120. does this
 
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
affect the funding going forward
 
03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
there are two other amendments before us
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
my amendments that both address the
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
funding and the operations they're both
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
good bills that get us extremely close
 
03:15:40.849 --> 03:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
to sb1
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
are they simply uh providing the the
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
wherewithal the move forward on the
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
construction and funded and pick the
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
spot uh yes sir one of the two
 
03:15:53.650 --> 03:15:53.660 align:start position:0%
amendments is very short and very
 
03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to to that the other
 
03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
one incorporates all of the operational
 
03:16:01.969 --> 03:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
aspects that the community has been
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying for for two years on having a
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed therapeutic based model
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
do we have that Amendment before us we
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
have both and they were both basically
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
introduced last time we heard 49 a week
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
one one is zero eight zero four
 
03:16:27.590 --> 03:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
03:16:29.690 --> 03:16:29.700 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to just do
 
03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
something short and simple is zero seven
 
03:16:34.190 --> 03:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
three eight
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
between the two I I prefer zero eight
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
zero four because it gets us closer to
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
being at sb1 but if all we want to do is
 
03:16:46.610 --> 03:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
to get this onto the floor and have the
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
money taken care of then zero seven
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay we need a second on that so your
 
03:17:01.269 --> 03:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
motion was to retain both 767 and air
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.410 --> 03:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't care if we do them one at a
 
03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
time or together but yes retain zero
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
all right since we started with zero
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
seven six seven
 
03:17:31.010 --> 03:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to retain amendments if
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
it would be easier if you withdrew that
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
what would be a superior motion I I
 
03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't I really don't want the committee
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
to to to pass these out of the committee
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
today because there are better
 
03:17:55.309 --> 03:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and the children and family
 
03:17:58.849 --> 03:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
law has not yet heard these policy
 
03:17:58.859 --> 03:18:00.590 align:start position:0%
law has not yet heard these policy
issues

03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
then I would suggest you withdraw the
 
03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:05.269 align:start position:0%
then I would suggest you withdraw the
amendments

03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.130 --> 03:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I would suggest
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
you just move the amendment that you
 
03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:10.730 align:start position:0%
you just move the amendment that you
prefer

03:18:10.730 --> 03:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
03:18:14.410 --> 03:18:14.420 align:start position:0%
the the one I prefer is
 
03:18:17.690 --> 03:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
zero eight zero four that we haven't
 
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
heard for from about in a week
 
03:18:21.240 --> 03:18:22.610 align:start position:0%
heard for from about in a week
both

03:18:22.610 --> 03:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
the other two are were current today but
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
I did introduce zero eight zero four a
 
03:18:30.889 --> 03:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
week ago
 
03:18:33.230 --> 03:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
and for anyone who's been following this
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
and when they read this this is this is
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
essentially the completion of the
 
03:18:43.210 --> 03:18:43.220 align:start position:0%
Senate's sb1 that passed 24 to nothing
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
and zero eight zero four I think I can
 
03:18:52.010 --> 03:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
say ex that all of the activists here
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
have looked at it and have supported it
 
03:18:57.889 --> 03:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
and I I think the department has
 
03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
supported zero eight zero four the
 
03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
governor's office has called me and said
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
it the Senate voted 24 to nothing so I
 
03:19:08.210 --> 03:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
the preponderance is that we really
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
ought to just pass zero eight zero four
 
03:19:14.530 --> 03:19:14.540 align:start position:0%
uh in an earlier time when we looked at
 
03:19:17.570 --> 03:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
0804 and representative hole brought up
 
03:19:20.090 --> 03:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
the fact that he thought the uh that
 
03:19:22.490 --> 03:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
might be a challenge on using arpa funds
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I forwarded that question that's
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
about a week and a half ago to the
 
03:19:29.330 --> 03:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
attorney general and said what do you
 
03:19:31.849 --> 03:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
think of this is it true that Maine has
 
03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
been sued for trying to use arpa funds
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
to fix a jail he wrote back and said he
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
found no evidence of that he said they
 
03:19:40.969 --> 03:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
had been a story and someone had written
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
a letter to the paper saying we
 
03:19:44.929 --> 03:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do this but he said there was
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
no formal thing filed and he and the uh
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
attorney for the Opera funds had both
 
03:19:54.190 --> 03:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed the
 
03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
proposal so that's again another reason
 
03:19:59.570 --> 03:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
why we have to move forward while These
 
03:20:02.450 --> 03:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
arpa funds have to be committed
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
within the year and then the bill the
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
building has to be built within by 2026
 
03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
I believe is that what do you recall
 
03:20:14.090 --> 03:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so there is there is
 
03:20:16.130 --> 03:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
a reason to move forward on something
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
that they can begin to go and request
 
03:20:21.769 --> 03:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
These arpa funds so a short and sweet
 
03:20:24.170 --> 03:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
one would be a good way to go
 
03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
one would be a good way to go
um

03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:27.889 --> 03:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
so now the amendment the motion we have
 
03:20:31.250 --> 03:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
before us is to accept zero eight zero
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
four Amendment which will be followed by
 
03:20:37.450 --> 03:20:37.460 align:start position:0%
a not to pass as amended Mr chairman
 
03:20:41.290 --> 03:20:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.929 --> 03:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
amendment 0804 was that was introduced
 
03:20:46.670 --> 03:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
in the division three
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
it was well
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
I I thought it was also in full Finance
 
03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
it was in full Finance
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
was introduced in full Finance it was
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
introduced to full Finance okay
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh yeah I want to get the procedures
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
right don't we that's right because I
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to don't want to hold on
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
something I've never never seen or has
 
03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
never been introduced yes that's that's
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
and I have notes on it that's where
 
03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative hole brought up the fact
 
03:21:14.580 --> 03:21:15.950 align:start position:0%
representative hole brought up the fact
about

03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:21:17.210 --> 03:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a challenge to
 
03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
using arpa funds so I run that by the
 
03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at the request of the
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
committee he's come back and said not to
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
worry that the arpa attorney and himself
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
think it's it easily satisfies the arpa
 
03:21:32.630 --> 03:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's an important way
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
to get this
 
03:21:36.530 --> 03:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
um funding going so we can start to
 
03:21:44.889 --> 03:21:44.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't know
 
03:21:48.590 --> 03:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
whether the question is appropriate at
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
this time or not but I I'm just trying
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
to understand whether
 
03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for example
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
we would maybe be better off if we just
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh looked at the 892 Amendment and just
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
change the effective date to something
 
03:22:07.490 --> 03:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
like July 1st 2024 to address director
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
ribsam's concerns that the changes may
 
03:22:11.450 --> 03:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
be effective immediately while at the
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
same time giving a bit of time you know
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
giving a clear idea of what we want and
 
03:22:18.170 --> 03:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
letting the department the appropriate
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
policy committee work on this
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the director already had concerns with
 
03:22:26.410 --> 03:22:26.420 align:start position:0%
what it would do to to
 
03:22:28.849 --> 03:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
incarcerating people that were brought
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
before if it becomes applicable
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
immediately you know what if it would be
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know in effect 60 days after the
 
03:22:37.969 --> 03:22:37.979 align:start position:0%
passage I was asking about a July 1st
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
2024 effective that would require
 
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
further amendments which I'm trying to
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
get the process moving
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I I don't want to
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
put words in Mr ribson's mouth but I
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe he's on record as already
 
03:22:51.840 --> 03:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
believe he's on record as already
supporting

03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
um my Amendment from last week zero
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
eight zero four and that he's shown up
 
03:23:02.750 --> 03:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
here today to oppose zero seven six
 
03:23:04.969 --> 03:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
seven and that when you add
 
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's concern I think by
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
extension he would probably oppose zero
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
eight nine two so of these three there's
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
one that you and are currently in favor
 
03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
zero eight zero four is that true that's
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:25.389 --> 03:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt Amendment 0804
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
does everyone understand that and have
 
03:23:34.370 --> 03:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
it before them
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:23:43.070 --> 03:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative walner yes I I just want
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm going to vote
 
03:23:47.330 --> 03:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
um no on this
 
03:23:51.190 --> 03:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
because for me the most important piece
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
in zero seven six seven
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
was the area where we limited what
 
03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
children would be placed in the sununu
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
center or the new sununu center and I'm
 
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
just gonna I'm I'm not gonna talk for
 
03:24:09.050 --> 03:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
very long I'm going to be really short
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I would like to bring everyone's
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
attention to the first
 
03:24:17.929 --> 03:24:17.939 align:start position:0%
um five lines of the bill
 
03:24:20.269 --> 03:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
of all of the bills every bill that
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've seen so far has these lines and
 
03:24:24.290 --> 03:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
the line says
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
placement in Corrections settings can be
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
harmful to children
 
03:24:32.809 --> 03:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
and lead to increased delinquency and
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
adult criminal Behavior
 
03:24:37.729 --> 03:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
it should therefore be reserved for
 
03:24:40.490 --> 03:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
those circumstances in which the safety
 
03:24:42.969 --> 03:24:42.979 align:start position:0%
of the child and of the community
 
03:24:46.010 --> 03:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
requires such confinement
 
03:24:48.889 --> 03:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
that to me sums it up we need to be sure
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
that this is limited to just the
 
03:24:55.969 --> 03:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
children who need this level of care
 
03:24:59.210 --> 03:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
and that is the reason I will be voting
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
it has that language that you just
 
03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:06.650 align:start position:0%
it has that language that you just
quoted

03:25:06.650 --> 03:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
but it does not have the sections in the
 
03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:12.349 align:start position:0%
but it does not have the sections in the
bill

03:25:12.349 --> 03:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:25:15.050 --> 03:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
does not have the sections around
 
03:25:18.349 --> 03:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
limiting who can be placed at the sununu
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
center which is on page six
 
03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:24.849 align:start position:0%
center which is on page six
of

03:25:24.849 --> 03:25:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
0767 from line 17. down through line 32.
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is zero eight zero
 
03:25:35.210 --> 03:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
four right and that's the one I'm going
 
03:25:37.130 --> 03:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
to vote against thank you
 
03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yeah I mean I
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
thought would the discussion we just had
 
03:25:43.849 --> 03:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
said that that decision would be going
 
03:25:45.650 --> 03:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
to Children and Family Law
 
03:25:47.150 --> 03:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
and that they would look at that and
 
03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
bring something in in January basically
 
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
to to address that issue and that that
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
was probably the more appropriate place
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.380 --> 03:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused I don't want to
 
03:26:06.530 --> 03:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
discuss 767 yet since it's not
 
03:26:08.809 --> 03:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
apparently up for discussion at this
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
point although I thought that's where
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to start today
 
03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:13.309 align:start position:0%
we're going to start today
but

03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against this as well
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
the points that were made this morning
 
03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
are essentially the ones that have been
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
made all along in this process which
 
03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
have been the hold up here
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's not enough just to build a new
 
03:26:26.399 --> 03:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
it's not enough just to build a new
building

03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's the whole idea behind 767 it
 
03:26:34.130 --> 03:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
brings together the new building along
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
with an approach that will over time
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the census at sununu and more
 
03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
reduce the census at sununu and more
importantly

03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
03:26:43.849 --> 03:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
Give Kids the opportunity not to be in
 
03:26:45.530 --> 03:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
sununu but that might otherwise be there
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
I understand there's disagreements
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
between the director and other people
 
03:26:52.010 --> 03:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
both in the community and out of the
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
community and I would like the chance to
 
03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
discuss the details of sections eight
 
03:26:59.570 --> 03:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
and nine but we can do that later I just
 
03:27:01.010 --> 03:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
want to say at this point I'm voting
 
03:27:01.020 --> 03:27:02.389 align:start position:0%
want to say at this point I'm voting
against

03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
against
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
084 and I'll also point out that 08 Ford
 
03:27:06.050 --> 03:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't allocate any funding so I'm not
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how that's going to help
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative hole
 
03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to take a brief minute and
 
03:27:19.130 --> 03:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
go back in history because this is
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
clearly an issue that is difficult to
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
resolve to approve July 13 1855 at a
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
meeting of the governor and Council July
 
03:27:29.330 --> 03:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
20th 1855 honorable Frederick Smith of
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
Manchester honorable Matthew Harvey of
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
Concord and Jose Eaton a squire of New
 
03:27:35.090 --> 03:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
Ipswich who are appointed to
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners agreeably for the
 
03:27:38.330 --> 03:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
provisions and the purposes named in the
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
foregoing resolution I will skip to the
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
resolution this is about the design and
 
03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
installation of a Reformation of
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
juvenile and female offenders who have
 
03:27:48.530 --> 03:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
committed the offenses against the state
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is part of what was the deed to
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
donate the property to the state
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
why I bring this up is it is to take the
 
03:28:01.130 --> 03:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
and I quote it is to take those who
 
03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
would otherwise fill our jails and state
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
prison and place them in an institution
 
03:28:06.290 --> 03:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
where they will both be morally and
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
physically trained away from the vicious
 
03:28:11.090 --> 03:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
influence of hardened convicted
 
03:28:13.490 --> 03:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
it says sorry hardened convict where
 
03:28:15.170 --> 03:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
they will receive the advantages of a
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
common school education where all
 
03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts will be made to
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
prepare them to earn an honest
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
livelihood honorable industry and in
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
some trade or other respectable
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
employment I think the appointment is
 
03:28:28.610 --> 03:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
we've been wrestling with this for 170
 
03:28:30.769 --> 03:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
years almost at this point this is a
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
difficult task but I I believe there is
 
03:28:35.690 --> 03:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
a group here who wants to see
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
a change in our statutes so that we are
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
not sending someone there inadvertently
 
03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I know that everybody in this room
 
03:28:45.229 --> 03:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
cares about the kids we all have a
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
common goal here
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
but when I read this document that was
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
handed this morning to us about the way
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
you could end up in the sununu center I
 
03:28:54.610 --> 03:28:54.620 align:start position:0%
could imagine
 
03:28:58.250 --> 03:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
easily okay where a trafficked teenage
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
girl ends up with three or four of
 
03:29:02.210 --> 03:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
offenses on this and when we do the the
 
03:29:04.130 --> 03:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
tally at the end of the day
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
with an overzealous prosecutor and the
 
03:29:08.450 --> 03:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
wrong judge
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
she might end up at the sununa center
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
and that is not the place to send a
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
female a young female person
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
that would be the wrong possible the
 
03:29:22.190 --> 03:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
worst thing you could do to them
 
03:29:23.929 --> 03:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
I believe we all want to do the right
 
03:29:25.370 --> 03:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
thing I believe we all want to make sure
 
03:29:27.410 --> 03:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
that the right kids are taken care of
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and some of them need compassion and
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
love as we heard this morning from
 
03:29:32.809 --> 03:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
former representative Blancher when he
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
heard I love you
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
I pardon for those who
 
03:29:41.819 --> 03:29:43.190 align:start position:0%
I pardon for those who
um

03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:44.570 --> 03:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share a piece of scripture
 
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
and it's it and it's
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's out of the Gospel of John and it
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
has to do with the adulterous woman and
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
I say this because
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
he shows the mercy and care that's
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
necessary for someone who has been
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
caught by the law back then adultery was
 
03:30:02.809 --> 03:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
a capital punishment offense and he said
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
let he who is without the first sin cast
 
03:30:07.130 --> 03:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
the first stone why do I say that
 
03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
because it was that love and mercy that
 
03:30:12.170 --> 03:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
changed her life we need to do the same
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
I cannot support this amendment the
 
03:30:16.969 --> 03:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
changes that are in 767 and subsequently
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
in 92 I think okay
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
um are the next step to make this work
 
03:30:27.410 --> 03:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
are we ready for a vote on 804 that's
 
03:30:34.250 --> 03:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:34.260 --> 03:30:35.450 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to support the motion I'm
 
03:30:41.150 --> 03:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
going to vote yay on this I I want to
 
03:30:42.769 --> 03:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
point out that the despite the
 
03:30:45.950 --> 03:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetical uh example of the sex
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking girl we have no testimony to
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
suggest that's ever really happened it
 
03:30:53.809 --> 03:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
it it and I don't think any of us would
 
03:30:55.490 --> 03:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
want it to but I think fortunately
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
reality is that it probably hasn't we
 
03:31:00.290 --> 03:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
heard from represent or on the honorable
 
03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
Cody Belanger who basically uh was
 
03:31:06.010 --> 03:31:06.020 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
767 and uh and I and I and from talking
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
to him I believe he would support zero
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
eight zero four this bill has been
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
worked for two years we have all of The
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
Advocates supporting zero eight zero
 
03:31:25.969 --> 03:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
four we have the department supporting
 
03:31:30.769 --> 03:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
zero eight zero four the Senate passed
 
03:31:33.170 --> 03:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
what the elements of zero eight zero
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
four and sb1 24-9 nothing the governor's
 
03:31:40.070 --> 03:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
office is in favor of zero eight zero
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
four so I so despite kind of this last
 
03:31:46.969 --> 03:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
minute let's change it and delay it and
 
03:31:49.550 --> 03:31:49.560 align:start position:0%

03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%

03:35:29.330 --> 03:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and I I Look to Him
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
regarding that one additional line but I
 
03:35:33.889 --> 03:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
know it hasn't been discussed in the
 
03:35:33.899 --> 03:35:35.450 align:start position:0%
know it hasn't been discussed in the
committee

03:35:35.450 --> 03:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:35:38.570 --> 03:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
um like the the whole 767 Amendment if
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
we move this I do know that the good
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
news is even if it passes the house as
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
is there's the Senate this doesn't
 
03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
become law Tomorrow there's lots of
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
times to make a small one-line tweak
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
along the way if we move 767 it gets
 
03:35:54.769 --> 03:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
from this house finance onto the floor
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
headed to the Senate which is the right
 
03:36:00.530 --> 03:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.929 --> 03:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Earth
 
03:36:06.050 --> 03:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
seconds at the motion before us is for
 
03:36:08.929 --> 03:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
zero zero seven six seven which we all
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
heard this morning
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion from the
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman thanks Mr
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
chairman again I
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not entirely familiar with all
 
03:36:25.729 --> 03:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
the division three material that we see
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
but I guess I'm concerned when I've
 
03:36:30.769 --> 03:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
heard that the advocates
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
have been supportive of the amendment
 
03:36:37.010 --> 03:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we just voted on and defeated and
 
03:36:40.190 --> 03:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the department is in favor of the
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
motion that we just defeated so I'm
 
03:36:44.570 --> 03:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
really concerned where this is going and
 
03:36:46.969 --> 03:36:46.979 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody could speak to me
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
why The Advocates were in favor of the
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
last bill or maybe they're not in favor
 
03:36:53.870 --> 03:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
of this one but I'm a little concerned
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
when The Advocates have been so loud and
 
03:36:58.010 --> 03:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
clear of their support
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill we just defeated and along
 
03:37:04.010 --> 03:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
with the department so I'm a little
 
03:37:05.769 --> 03:37:05.779 align:start position:0%
concerned about that Mr chairman
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative Hull sure if I I'm
 
03:37:10.729 --> 03:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
willing to take my best to summarize
 
03:37:14.330 --> 03:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
several of The Advocates came in on page
 
03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:15.410 align:start position:0%
several of The Advocates came in on page
two

03:37:15.410 --> 03:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:37:18.290 --> 03:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
um lines 24 and 25 in particular right
 
03:37:20.690 --> 03:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
and this has to do with the concerns
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that were raised regarding the Staffing
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
at the center several of them mentioned
 
03:37:27.229 --> 03:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
the Prius standards which is the prison
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
rape elimination act standards I think
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
all of those who looked into this who
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
were part of crafting this amendment
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
weren't looking for ratios at one to
 
03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
eight we heard discussions where's my
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
notes we heard discussions by some of
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
the outside that they have ratios of two
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
to twelve in other places one even said
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
one to three I think there's the reality
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
is that the children that are in this
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
Center are going to require a certain
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
level of attention that attention is
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
greater than one to one when we were
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
just discussing this amendment we were
 
03:38:01.330 --> 03:38:01.340 align:start position:0%
trying to be at one to four
 
03:38:05.050 --> 03:38:05.060 align:start position:0%
I did some research and in hb1 of
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
2016-2017 which was when director ripson
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
would have been operating in the budget
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
that he would have come into there was
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
90 staff members allocated the sununu
 
03:38:18.410 --> 03:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
center for 70 kids we have 87 in the
 
03:38:20.750 --> 03:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
current budget request I think the goal
 
03:38:22.370 --> 03:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
of this was to try and make sure the
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
facility was designed to be at the four
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
or five members per child there not at
 
03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:31.729 align:start position:0%
or five members per child there not at
eight

03:38:31.729 --> 03:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:34.370 --> 03:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson shook his head I'll ask him to
 
03:38:37.010 --> 03:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
what his comment would be about the
 
03:38:37.020 --> 03:38:39.769 align:start position:0%
what his comment would be about the
Staffing

03:38:39.769 --> 03:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
03:38:42.590 --> 03:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
I started here October 2017 I wasn't
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
part of that budget process but when I
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
came here there was well over 100 staff
 
03:38:49.729 --> 03:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
at sysc so I'm not quite sure what that
 
03:38:50.990 --> 03:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
budget process was or what the language
 
03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
was it's being talked about there but
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
there were well over 100 staff at that
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
point at this point I think it's
 
03:38:58.490 --> 03:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the mid 80s that includes
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of staff that we say we
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
would no longer need if we were to be
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
able to co-locate and be able to share
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
services like maintenance laundry
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
nutrition etc etc etc
 
03:39:11.690 --> 03:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:13.190 --> 03:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative erf do you want to
 
03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:15.290 align:start position:0%
representative erf do you want to
comment

03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:39:18.050 --> 03:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
any of the other people that uh that did
 
03:39:18.060 --> 03:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
any of the other people that uh that did
not

03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll I'll be brief I'm I'm
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
pretty disappointed with what we're
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
doing right now and what it feels like
 
03:39:29.450 --> 03:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
this committee is doing I think we're
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
all operating under the correct
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
assumption that we do have to build and
 
03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
construct a new new Youth Services
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
Center or a Youth Detention Facility
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Detention whatever we want to
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
call it we have to do it and we
 
03:39:43.849 --> 03:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
recognize that to use the bill to
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
construct the new center as leverage for
 
03:39:50.690 --> 03:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
policy changes that should be made in
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
the policy committee is where we should
 
03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
be focused on we should be tasked with
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
the financing of the new facility
 
03:40:00.969 --> 03:40:00.979 align:start position:0%
that is our job as the finance committee
 
03:40:04.370 --> 03:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
allow the policy committees that are new
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
since the last time this language was
 
03:40:09.309 --> 03:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
discussed to work out among themselves
 
03:40:12.170 --> 03:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
the criminal codes and the ways that
 
03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
people get to the sununu center the
 
03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
youth detention center and let us be
 
03:40:19.969 --> 03:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
tasked with building the thing that's
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
our job and I I we're not Washington DC
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be leveraging must pass
 
03:40:28.610 --> 03:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
legislation in order to pass in other
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
policy priorities that haven't gone
 
03:40:32.929 --> 03:40:32.939 align:start position:0%
through the current year policy
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I'm going to vote no on
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment there's another amendment
 
03:40:39.050 --> 03:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
that is more watered down that if we can
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
pass it we can actually make sure the
 
03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
construction gets handled and let's let
 
03:40:46.130 --> 03:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
other members of the legislature in the
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
policy area for criminal activity and
 
03:40:51.769 --> 03:40:51.779 align:start position:0%
for children and family law to focus on
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the statutes that are sending people to
 
03:40:56.090 --> 03:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
the center and let us focus on what we
 
03:40:58.910 --> 03:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
need to do to build the new facility so
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm voting no on this I'd love to vote
 
03:41:02.809 --> 03:41:02.819 align:start position:0%
Yes on another amendment and get this
 
03:41:04.490 --> 03:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
bill out of here today but we should not
 
03:41:04.500 --> 03:41:05.690 align:start position:0%
bill out of here today but we should not
use

03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
honestly bad objects and bad politics to
 
03:41:08.399 --> 03:41:09.290 align:start position:0%
honestly bad objects and bad politics to
lever

03:41:09.290 --> 03:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
lever
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
different policy positions onto this
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill that haven't been fully vetted by
 
03:41:15.410 --> 03:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
the appropriate policy committee thank
 
03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:16.190 align:start position:0%
the appropriate policy committee thank
you

03:41:16.190 --> 03:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I had hope not to
 
03:41:23.210 --> 03:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
go down this road I thought we'd be
 
03:41:25.610 --> 03:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
discussing the bills but it seems that
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
what's really important to folks here is
 
03:41:30.290 --> 03:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
that this is supposedly we're rushing
 
03:41:33.650 --> 03:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
this through at the last minute
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
we need a little history of what's going
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
on this term first of all if you look at
 
03:41:39.530 --> 03:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
this bill the actual underlying Bill
 
03:41:42.849 --> 03:41:42.859 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today it's a bill to
 
03:41:46.010 --> 03:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
extend the closing date of the sununu
 
03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
center and allocate the funds to pay for
 
03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
the sunundo center through the rest of
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's a bill that should have been
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
rushed through because what was the
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
deadline we had to meet
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
we had to stop the sununa center being
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
closed in March did we rush this bill
 
03:42:00.660 --> 03:42:01.610 align:start position:0%
closed in March did we rush this bill
through

03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
no no we didn't
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
what happened and what happened behind
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
the scenes unbeknownst to most of us
 
03:42:10.130 --> 03:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
here certainly most of us or I should
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
say maybe just some of us in division
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
three the Senate put together a bill not
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
only to extend the dates and fund for
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
the FY 23 period of time
 
03:42:23.690 --> 03:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
but also to do a whole massive amount of
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
other things and they rushed that bill
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
through over in the Senate and in fact
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that 24 to nothing vote was actually not
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
a 24 to nothing vote because that was an
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
illegitimate vote that was held in the
 
03:42:34.140 --> 03:42:34.849 align:start position:0%
illegitimate vote that was held in the
original

03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
um or committee dual committee meetings
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
like we held here
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
one that came over here to the house it
 
03:42:42.290 --> 03:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
was rushed through children and family
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
law I didn't even learn about it until
 
03:42:46.610 --> 03:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
the day literally the day of the hearing
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
in children and family law and there
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
were folks in children and family law
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
that I spoke with that were kind of
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
surprised that it went through as
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
quickly as it did so the process has
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
been rushed that's absolutely true
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
then it came here to finance and we were
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
actually able to to take out most of it
 
03:43:03.469 --> 03:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
and leave in there the critical pieces
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
the date change the funding and finding
 
03:43:09.410 --> 03:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
a site for the facility and starting the
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
design process all of that is already in
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
process and all of that is going to take
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
time nothing we're doing here today is
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
going to impact the construction of the
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
sununa center it that couldn't be
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
handled in another month or two months
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the whole process is concerned
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm frustrated as well absolutely for
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
sure but this language has been vetted
 
03:43:33.769 --> 03:43:33.779 align:start position:0%
through this house last year were there
 
03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
issues with it as Judge Lynn has pointed
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
out absolutely and as Judge Lynn has
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
pointed out he was very gracious in
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
working with me to help improve it to
 
03:43:45.290 --> 03:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
the point where it's at now we do have a
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
minor disagreement I'd call it a minor
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
agreement he'd call it major regarding
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
one piece that he asked about but we
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
have been working through this in in the
 
03:43:54.889 --> 03:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
most in the most effective way we can
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
given the constraints this is an early
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
bill this has to be out tomorrow
 
03:44:01.849 --> 03:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
whereas it doesn't need to be this issue
 
03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:03.779 align:start position:0%
does not need to be resolved tomorrow we
 
03:44:06.050 --> 03:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
have the budget the normal process that
 
03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
Finance runs and you'll see that through
 
03:44:09.050 --> 03:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the bills we're going to
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
exec today
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
is bills that are going to be that have
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
money they get they get held retained
 
03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
and they get put into the budget this
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
process this particular process has been
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
completely out of the ordinary
 
03:44:24.769 --> 03:44:24.779 align:start position:0%
as far as the way Finance works and the
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
way bills normally proceed through the
 
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
entire process so I am voting in favor
 
03:44:31.370 --> 03:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
of this because I do think it is the
 
03:44:34.130 --> 03:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
seven I'm sorry I'm voting yes the favor
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
of 767 because I do think you need to
 
03:44:38.929 --> 03:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
put together both it's not just about
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
building a new facility this new
 
03:44:43.309 --> 03:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
facility will not be built we started we
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
allocated funding appropriate funding
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
for the forensic prison forensic
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that we call it it's like
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatric whatever it is
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
four years ago and it still hasn't
 
03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
broken ground so
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
let's be realistic in terms of time
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
frames what we're talking about today is
 
03:45:00.889 --> 03:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
trying to rush what we were talking
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
about in the last vote we took was
 
03:45:04.610 --> 03:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
trying to rush things through
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting is a better
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
alternative which will do all the things
 
03:45:10.610 --> 03:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
that one does and in fact it's based on
 
03:45:13.610 --> 03:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
the original Amendment the 767 is based
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
on the original amendment that was voted
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
out of our division three slash division
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
one meeting several weeks ago which
 
03:45:21.410 --> 03:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
you'll note you didn't see here today
 
03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason so I am voting in
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
favor of this and I think it is the
 
03:45:28.190 --> 03:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
right thing to do for the children
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I'm I'm not
 
03:45:36.370 --> 03:45:36.380 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this amendment because
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
but the amendment I would vote for is
 
03:45:39.479 --> 03:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
but the amendment I would vote for is
892.

03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
892.
 
03:45:43.809 --> 03:45:43.819 align:start position:0%
that's different by two three four words
 
03:45:46.729 --> 03:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
and it fixes a serious problem in the
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have in front of us
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
the the amendment we have in front of us
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
has a different set of crimes for
 
03:45:54.120 --> 03:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
has a different set of crimes for
commission

03:45:55.190 --> 03:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
to commit someone or to detain them that
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
makes no sense
 
03:46:04.010 --> 03:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
um zero eight nine two h
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same set of crimes for which
 
03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
someone can be committed and detained
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
right otherwise they're identical so why
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
should we pass something we know right
 
03:46:16.010 --> 03:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
now is flawed when right on the table in
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
front of us is something that's less
 
03:46:21.410 --> 03:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
flawed you know which I would vote for
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.319 --> 03:46:32.050 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:46:32.050 --> 03:46:32.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to state that
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
because of the concerns expressed by
 
03:46:39.650 --> 03:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
director ibsum by the because of the
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
impact of this immediately I'm not gonna
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
support this amendment even though I do
 
03:46:46.849 --> 03:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
like it in principle but I'm concerned
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
about the immediate effective date so uh
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.729 --> 03:46:57.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
just a quick one the the the the section
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
in here sections eight and nine it's
 
03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
without doubt been in testimony that
 
03:47:13.370 --> 03:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
these were the very first times those
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
two sections have been heard anywhere in
 
03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
the house anywhere in the Senate since
 
03:47:20.450 --> 03:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
this calendar year began and this
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislature began so so this is brand
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
new stuff this is the example of rushing
 
03:47:29.690 --> 03:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
things through that could very well at
 
03:47:31.610 --> 03:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
the request of the chairman of Children
 
03:47:34.010 --> 03:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
and Family Law go over to them for the
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
policy issue so so I'm going to vote
 
03:47:36.479 --> 03:47:37.849 align:start position:0%
policy issue so so I'm going to vote
against

03:47:37.849 --> 03:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
against
 
03:47:37.859 --> 03:47:39.130 align:start position:0%
against
um

03:47:39.130 --> 03:47:39.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:43.130 --> 03:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
767 and I hope you will as well I might
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
be inclined to vote for zero eight nine
 
03:47:48.050 --> 03:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
two as an alternative to this horrible
 
03:47:48.060 --> 03:47:50.630 align:start position:0%
two as an alternative to this horrible
alternative

03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:47:55.729 --> 03:47:55.739 align:start position:0%

this committee zero seven three eight
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
this is a skinny Bill all it does is it
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
gets us out of the policy issues
 
03:53:19.969 --> 03:53:19.979 align:start position:0%
entirely does an appropriation and
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
designate who makes the decision on the
 
03:53:26.090 --> 03:53:26.100 align:start position:0%

final site selection and size it also

committee
 
03:53:40.969 --> 03:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
has it had a discussion before the full
 
03:53:43.849 --> 03:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
committee I attempted that last week and
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
I was stopped because there was a
 
03:53:48.050 --> 03:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment that we were
 
03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
supposed to discuss today and we've done
 
03:53:52.250 --> 03:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a copy of that
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment you said zero eight zero seven
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
three eight I do have a copy of it it's
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
just it's just basically a front page
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
with a tiny amount on the back all this
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
does is it has Finance do Finance stuff
 
03:54:09.290 --> 03:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
it appropriates the money gets us out of
 
03:54:10.969 --> 03:54:10.979 align:start position:0%
the policy issue we've heard that
 
03:54:14.330 --> 03:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
chairman of uh children and family law
 
03:54:17.570 --> 03:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
say please let them do policy so this is
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
us where we can just do the money and
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
do you understand this would cancel the
 
03:54:27.170 --> 03:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
one that just passed with a fairly good
 
03:54:27.180 --> 03:54:28.849 align:start position:0%
one that just passed with a fairly good
vote

03:54:28.849 --> 03:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
I I still wanted to get a vote because I
 
03:54:39.050 --> 03:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
I guess we can do that representative
 
03:54:40.859 --> 03:54:43.550 align:start position:0%
I guess we can do that representative
hole

03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:46.729 --> 03:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
is everyone familiar with it
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:54:54.410 --> 03:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
will you just restate and be clear that
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
if we pass this amendment the previous
 
03:55:00.530 --> 03:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment 892 would be voided
 
03:55:00.540 --> 03:55:02.689 align:start position:0%
Amendment 892 would be voided
yes

03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I understood that there is a
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
possibility that OLS can can merge when
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
they're too accepted amendments or or in
 
03:55:13.010 --> 03:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
this if there are two accepted bills
 
03:55:16.370 --> 03:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
from the house floor that contradict
 
03:55:19.130 --> 03:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
each other a little bit I understood OLS
 
03:55:21.530 --> 03:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
can do some merger is there no merging
 
03:55:21.540 --> 03:55:22.670 align:start position:0%
can do some merger is there no merging
of

03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:55:27.530 --> 03:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
depends on what the motion is for once
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
we have established amendments what
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass has amended States
 
03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:40.250 align:start position:0%
ought to pass has amended States
place

03:55:40.250 --> 03:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.330 --> 03:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe to
 
03:55:49.130 --> 03:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
answer representative Edwards question
 
03:55:51.490 --> 03:55:51.500 align:start position:0%
in amendment number
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
0738 line five it does say the bill
 
03:55:58.370 --> 03:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
replaces all after the enacting Clause
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
to me that's a replacement Amendment
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
so though some amendments could be
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
compatible this does not appear to be a
 
03:56:08.570 --> 03:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
compatible one it appears to be a
 
03:56:11.330 --> 03:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
replacement thank you Mr chair thank you

any question about it
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
um this original bill
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
did something that was in the budget
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
last time which was to have the state
 
04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
pay out of General funds seven and a
 
04:03:51.769 --> 04:03:51.779 align:start position:0%

retirement part of their expenses
 
04:03:56.880 --> 04:03:58.370 align:start position:0%
retirement part of their expenses
and

04:03:58.370 --> 04:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we tried the the bill itself uh
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
deadlocked in our division four to four
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
as is
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
so we proposed this amendment
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
um which was unanimous to instead uh
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
instead take a similar amount of money
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
in this case 50 million dollars and put
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
it into the against the unfunded
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
liability of the retirement system and
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
that has the effect of saving uh money
 
04:04:29.929 --> 04:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
to similar effects saving money to towns
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and uh other employers but it does
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
it slowly over time rather than all at
 
04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
once just in this biennium now you
 
04:04:42.050 --> 04:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
should all have a kind of a gray looking
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.969 --> 04:04:48.979 align:start position:0%
this is the analysis of this amendment
 
04:04:52.250 --> 04:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that
 
04:04:54.530 --> 04:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
um spending 50 million dollars in this
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
way will save the uh towns and and other
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
employers a hundred and five million
 
04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
dollars over the next
 
04:05:07.849 --> 04:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
um 20 years
 
04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
all right due to the magic of compound
 
04:05:13.130 --> 04:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
interest so so this is the
 
04:05:15.650 --> 04:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
fix the problem slowly sort of amendment
 
04:05:18.370 --> 04:05:18.380 align:start position:0%
rather than um yeah
 
04:05:20.929 --> 04:05:20.939 align:start position:0%
rather than dump some money all at once
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
and still have a serious problem next
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
time so
 
04:05:24.840 --> 04:05:25.550 align:start position:0%
time so
um

04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so 50 million dollars cost now
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
gains us 105 over the over the decades
 
04:05:35.809 --> 04:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
um now my particular plan for this
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
amendment and I would invite comment is
 
04:05:41.330 --> 04:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
to treat it sort of Senate style and
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
that is this is a big change from the
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
way the original bill was written it's
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
the same subject but it's so I think
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
it's completely germane but it's it's a
 
04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
change of tactics sort of and um so I
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
would like this committee to vote this
 
04:05:58.010 --> 04:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass send it to the house floor
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully get an off to pass there and
 
04:06:03.170 --> 04:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
then ask to table it
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
um and then put it in to our budget
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
right so so do it sort of Senate style
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
where we pass the policy and then that
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
will be the house the house policy
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
um and then but it will it will be in
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
the budget we will not pass the bill on
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
clerk will call call a role on adopting

04:13:51.530 --> 04:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
now I'll speak to my motion okay there
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
were several changes we we worked on
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
this quite a bit within the within the
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
division there are several changes to
 
04:14:01.969 --> 04:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the first change is
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the amount of 25 million dollars is
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
going to be appropriated to the
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
instead of to the legislative branch the
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
division was persuaded that from an
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
oversight and experiential standpoint
 
04:14:21.050 --> 04:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
Das was the appropriate
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
um agency to to appropriate the money to
 
04:14:28.729 --> 04:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
and to oversee the project and there was
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
consensus on that uh within the division
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
the second change that was made was that
 
04:14:36.239 --> 04:14:37.689 align:start position:0%
the second change that was made was that
um

04:14:37.689 --> 04:14:37.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:40.849 --> 04:14:40.859 align:start position:0%
22.5 million dollars will be coming out
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the general fund but 2.5 million
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
dollars will be coming out of the
 
04:14:48.530 --> 04:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
legislative account so that the
 
04:14:51.050 --> 04:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
legislature uses some of the money that
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
we appropriate to it to construct its
 
04:14:57.290 --> 04:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
garage so that was the second point I
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
would just add here that in the
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
governor's budget he appropriated
 
04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
um 15 million dollars so this is 10
 
04:15:09.170 --> 04:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
million more than uh what the governor
 
04:15:09.180 --> 04:15:10.849 align:start position:0%
million more than uh what the governor
appropriated

04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
minus the 2.5 that is coming out of the
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislative account so we thought that
 
04:15:19.370 --> 04:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
was a good uh change the next thing
 
04:15:21.650 --> 04:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're doing I don't know how many of you
 
04:15:24.050 --> 04:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
are familiar with what we call the
 
04:15:27.650 --> 04:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview committee the
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
way things uh had usually been capital
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
projects went through the capital budget
 
04:15:36.530 --> 04:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then they would go for oversight to
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget overview committee
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
the way things have been going now
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have capital projects going
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget sometimes as
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing today we have projects
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
going that are capital infrastructure
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
projects going through the operating
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
budget we all agreed and so did the uh
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house that
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of how they were funded they
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
still deserved oversight and so there
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
was great consensus on our committee
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we should convert that that
 
04:16:12.769 --> 04:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
overview committee to the capital
 
04:16:15.530 --> 04:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
project overview committee so that's
 
04:16:18.530 --> 04:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
what we did the next thing that we did
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
was we created a joint legislative
 
04:16:24.889 --> 04:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
parking garage oversight commission to
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
specifically oversee this rather large
 
04:16:30.650 --> 04:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
project which is going to involve the
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
construction of the parking garage
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
raising the doj building and also
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
raising the much beloved store street
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
and what you'll see here you can see
 
04:16:47.929 --> 04:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
with who the appointees are a couple of
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
important important points here is that
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate and the
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House in addition to
 
04:16:57.170 --> 04:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
having a senator and a representative
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
they can also designate someone who can
 
04:17:03.370 --> 04:17:03.380 align:start position:0%
be a public member who might bring more
 
04:17:06.110 --> 04:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
experience to the um
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
to the project
 
04:17:08.399 --> 04:17:11.330 align:start position:0%
to the project
and

04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
that is it there is a reporting
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
requirement you'll see on page three
 
04:17:21.650 --> 04:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
line four that Das is going to provide
 
04:17:21.660 --> 04:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
line four that Das is going to provide
um

04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:25.330 --> 04:17:25.340 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports to this legislative
 
04:17:28.490 --> 04:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
parking garage oversight Commission
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
so that's what the amendment does we
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
sought to really build in more oversight
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the project and I hope that the
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee will support the amendment
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
can we adopt the amendment by a show of
 
04:17:48.170 --> 04:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
hands representative Hewitt Mr chairman
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%

seamless in our division I read the
 
04:18:03.729 --> 04:18:03.739 align:start position:0%
wrong number
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%

construction of a rail chilled box
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
tunnel in Dairy this was quite a lively
 
04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
discussion so I like to turn this over
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
to representative McGuire

04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
here a second
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.689 --> 04:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
further discussion would you like me to
 
04:21:28.849 --> 04:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
explain please all right so um this is a
 
04:21:30.889 --> 04:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
bill uh brought To Us by representative
 
04:21:34.130 --> 04:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
Pearson who I see in the room and he
 
04:21:36.530 --> 04:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
made a fairly strong case for this this
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
is um there's there's a very uh High
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
expensive construction on ion-93 EX
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's a brand new exit exit 4A it's a
 
04:21:49.570 --> 04:21:49.580 align:start position:0%
construction is I think at this time
 
04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
over 125 million dollars worth and in
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
their original design they they had a
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
crossing for a rail trail that would go
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
through a tunnel under the Connector
 
04:22:03.290 --> 04:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
Road and
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
um as the design progressed D.O.T
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
changed the design to have both the
 
04:22:09.120 --> 04:22:10.750 align:start position:0%
changed the design to have both the
surface

04:22:10.750 --> 04:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
surface
 
04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
Crossing as well as a kind of a
 
04:22:17.090 --> 04:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
circuitous second crossing under a
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
bridge that was nearby and
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so we we had a lot a testimony on
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
this it was very active but at the end
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
of the day our division decided not to
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
second guess Dot's actions which seemed
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
to us to be reasonable and also not to
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
add any kind of potential delays to such
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.170 --> 04:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
motion before us is inexperienced
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislative bill 506.
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
04:22:56.530 --> 04:22:56.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add one thing to Mr
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire's comments a second there is an
 
04:23:03.370 --> 04:23:03.380 align:start position:0%
existing contract between Dot
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the town
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
and this would put us in the middle of
 
04:23:08.760 --> 04:23:09.769 align:start position:0%
and this would put us in the middle of
that

04:23:09.769 --> 04:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation which would be a bad thing I
 
04:23:12.600 --> 04:23:15.889 align:start position:0%
situation which would be a bad thing I
believe

04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
see another hand over there
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Muller
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
first I would like to thank division one
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%

04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%

04:23:35.929 --> 04:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
that you put in second I would like to
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
note that um
 
04:23:40.370 --> 04:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
I would normally vote no on this ideal
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
but this is the original version of the
 
04:23:44.929 --> 04:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
bill which includes the criminal
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
penalties and all that and uh
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
even though I would support the
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill I will be unable
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
to support that particular language so
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'll be unable to you know do that but I
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify thank you
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman the bill was actually
 
04:24:08.090 --> 04:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
amended we took that language out of why
 
04:24:10.490 --> 04:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have a corrected copy I'm not
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
sure but just so the record is clear we
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
did take that punishing language out
 
04:24:17.450 --> 04:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you it is the original language
 
04:24:17.460 --> 04:24:18.530 align:start position:0%

04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
appropriating state general fund Surplus
 
04:26:05.570 --> 04:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
towards a retirement system
 
04:26:08.450 --> 04:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and thank you Mr
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
chairman I vote I I move
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the house bill 555.
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
representing whole seconds
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
so may I speak yes so this one is a
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
policy straight policy bill that has no
 
04:26:28.370 --> 04:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
Financial impact but it's about our
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
policy in finance so what it says is
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that if at such time the amount in the
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund is equal to 10 percent of
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
the biennial amount of the general fund
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
which today would be something like 300
 
04:26:47.530 --> 04:26:47.540 align:start position:0%
plus million dollars
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
then any further surpluses
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
75 percent of them would go to pay off
 
04:26:56.090 --> 04:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability of the retirement
 
04:26:56.100 --> 04:26:57.170 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability of the retirement
system

04:26:57.170 --> 04:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a it would only take effect if
 
04:27:02.880 --> 04:27:03.469 align:start position:0%
so it's a it would only take effect if
um

04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the general fund has a very adequate
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
cushion or the rainy day fund has a very
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
adequate cushion and such and then we
 
04:27:13.610 --> 04:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
would start move start paying off our
 
04:27:15.410 --> 04:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
debts in the form of the unfunded
 
04:27:15.420 --> 04:27:17.030 align:start position:0%
debts in the form of the unfunded
liability

04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:27:17.040 --> 04:27:17.630 align:start position:0%
liability
um

04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet but should we get
 
04:27:22.610 --> 04:27:22.620 align:start position:0%

uh Amendment 0933
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
for consideration
 
04:29:14.880 --> 04:29:16.189 align:start position:0%
for consideration
uh

04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
basically modifies the original bill
 
04:29:24.290 --> 04:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
that was submitted and also the original
 
04:29:27.649 --> 04:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
some of the original language it was in
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of the amendment uh
 
04:29:34.849 --> 04:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
in this amendment packet and basically
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
it takes the bathroom installation
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
language out of the original RSA and
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
just says what made it made available
 
04:29:46.370 --> 04:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to the school district on
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
where they're going to how they're going
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
to handle this or the school
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
it changes girls to menstruating student
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
in order to resolve future complications
 
04:29:58.729 --> 04:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
the money has been deleted this is a
 
04:30:00.490 --> 04:30:00.500 align:start position:0%
free free of charge
 
04:30:04.729 --> 04:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
the 28-a suggestion was uh negated
 
04:30:06.530 --> 04:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
because we actually give that the
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
schools over a billion dollars a year
 
04:30:10.250 --> 04:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
and we figure hygiene products could be
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
covered by that
 
04:30:12.600 --> 04:30:13.550 align:start position:0%
covered by that
um

04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:15.050 --> 04:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's it for the
 
04:30:15.060 --> 04:30:16.309 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's it for the
amendment

04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:16.319 --> 04:30:20.450 align:start position:0%
amendment

Bill 129.
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%

Mr chair does the fiscal note change
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
well since we took since we took the
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
money out of the bill
 
04:31:32.330 --> 04:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
I would assume there wouldn't be a
 
04:31:36.110 --> 04:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal motor any longer yeah
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I have a question about that
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
I as I recall a fiscal note it's been a
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
while since I looked at it the fiscal
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
note was meant to reflect the cost of
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
the current law to the schools did it
 
04:31:52.010 --> 04:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
not or or was it the fiscal notes
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
strictly what it would cost the state if
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
we met our 28a obligations can you can
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
you remind can you remind me Fiscal note
 
04:32:01.849 --> 04:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
was calculated based on the original
 
04:32:01.859 --> 04:32:03.849 align:start position:0%
was calculated based on the original
bills

04:32:03.849 --> 04:32:03.859 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:32:08.090 --> 04:32:08.100 align:start position:0%

04:32:12.410 --> 04:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
costs and retroactive payments thank you
 
04:32:15.410 --> 04:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
some previous cases have gone to the
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on 28a issues for schools
 
04:32:22.189 --> 04:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
and the decisions I recall were you're
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
already getting a billion dollars
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
find the money in that
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
so that was the way that it was decided
 
04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court it isn't like
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%

perhaps too narrowly when we think we
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
need to take a broader look at it
 
04:46:13.500 --> 04:46:26.650 align:start position:0%

three o'clock or so yep
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
so does anybody wish to do another roll
 
04:50:06.150 --> 04:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
call on this I am so tired of this bill
 
04:50:06.160 --> 04:50:10.550 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]

04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:50:12.770 --> 04:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
just the question uh did that end up
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
and this and another rule we usually
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow if there's money in a bill it
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't go on consent unless it's itl we
 
04:50:31.550 --> 04:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
see a lot of FN bills on consent with an
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
Ito that's fine
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
but if there's money to be spent it's
 
04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
not good to have it on the consent
 
04:50:37.620 --> 04:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
not good to have it on the consent
calendar

04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%

now tomorrow the
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative walner I think you're
 
04:50:59.570 --> 04:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
getting ready to do just what I was
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to ask you could you kind of
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
outline for us what we have for the next
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks what our schedule is
 
04:51:07.610 --> 04:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
what our deadlines are particularly
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
we have deadlines at the end of March
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
we'll probably go before
 
04:51:15.660 --> 04:51:16.250 align:start position:0%
we'll probably go before
um

04:51:16.250 --> 04:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:19.550 --> 04:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
let's see Mr Ripple or Mr landrigan can
 
04:51:21.288 --> 04:51:21.298 align:start position:0%
tell us when we have to come before the
 
04:51:28.610 --> 04:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think it might be on Thursday the 30th
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon
 
04:51:46.010 --> 04:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna work starting from today so
 
04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
looking into next week we have a couple
 
04:51:50.208 --> 04:51:50.218 align:start position:0%
house session days the 22nd 23rd we do
 
04:51:52.368 --> 04:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
have session tomorrow as well the 23rd
 
04:51:53.810 --> 04:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
was the day that we've been kind of
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
holding as the division deadline
 
04:51:58.368 --> 04:51:58.378 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping everything is decided at
 
04:51:59.810 --> 04:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
the division level by that day that will
 
04:52:02.090 --> 04:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
give us that weekend to put together the
 
04:52:03.770 --> 04:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
detail changes the packages all the
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
Amendments for that following week which
 
04:52:08.090 --> 04:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
is Monday the 27th
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
those days is when will exec House Bill
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
one and two here from the division
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
shares do the presentations of the
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
divisions recommendations as well as
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
boy 20 30 however many more bills that
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
the committee still has we'll have to
 
04:52:22.490 --> 04:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
exec that week
 
04:52:25.550 --> 04:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
jumping forward after the final data
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
report the budget will be the 30th
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
jumping forward that following week
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
there would be a House briefing to uh
 
04:52:32.930 --> 04:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
the finance committee would brief the
 
04:52:34.850 --> 04:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
house on the House pass budget excuse me
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
the house finance pass budget
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know the exact date for that
 
04:52:40.550 --> 04:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
usually as either that Monday or Tuesday
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
so the third or the fourth and I don't
 
04:52:44.690 --> 04:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
think that's been scheduled yet
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
the third or fourth of April April yes
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've we've got some time
 
04:52:51.480 --> 04:52:52.190 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've we've got some time
um

04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
in in divisions can you brief us on the
 
04:52:58.128 --> 04:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
plan that you have
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
we will probably meet again to exec some
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
some more bills that we still have
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
before us I believe
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.050 --> 04:53:14.060 align:start position:0%
representative leishman do you want to
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
spell out your plans sure Mr chairman
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
we're just about done with meeting with
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
everyone we've uh I would say about
 
04:53:26.650 --> 04:53:26.660 align:start position:0%
85 or 90 done with our work
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
we should have no trouble meeting the
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
deadline of having everything ready for
 
04:53:31.798 --> 04:53:34.550 align:start position:0%
deadline of having everything ready for
presentation

04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:37.330 --> 04:53:37.340 align:start position:0%
by the 23rd do you have anything
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
immediately ahead that you want to
 
04:53:39.360 --> 04:53:41.330 align:start position:0%
immediately ahead that you want to
discuss

04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple of bills that are
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
holding us up on retirement that's
 
04:53:48.490 --> 04:53:48.500 align:start position:0%
pretty much our only concern House Bill
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
463 436.
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
and 571 is that the right one
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
other than that uh we'll have about 20
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%

04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%

Provisions in House Bill 2 currently
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
greater than 50 percent of the pages uh
 
04:54:26.930 --> 04:54:26.940 align:start position:0%

that
 
04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
division two
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%

Edwards for division three
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
I think we're getting pretty close we
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of discussion it hurt not
 
04:55:17.448 --> 04:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
having uh yesterday's work day
 
04:55:20.570 --> 04:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
um but I I I think we're going to end up
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
making all the deadlines anyways I don't
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be in agreement but
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
we'll be done because we'll be out of
 
04:55:26.638 --> 04:55:30.368 align:start position:0%
we'll be done because we'll be out of
time

04:55:30.368 --> 04:55:30.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative Hull thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
the schedule that was given to us for
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
the calendar is there a way to get that
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
as a document so those of us who are
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
visual can look at it and know when we
 
04:55:46.250 --> 04:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.288 --> 04:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
yeah let's I think it'll all go in the
 
04:55:48.298 --> 04:55:50.448 align:start position:0%
yeah let's I think it'll all go in the
calendar

04:55:50.448 --> 04:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
04:55:53.090 --> 04:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
um representative yes there's also
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
um on the on the cork board here in
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
Janet's office is a is a calendar which
 
04:56:00.890 --> 04:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
you can pull down and copy and put back
 
04:56:00.900 --> 04:56:02.030 align:start position:0%
you can pull down and copy and put back
so

04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:02.040 --> 04:56:03.410 align:start position:0%
so
foreign

04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all your patience for the
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
long public hearing we had it was
 
04:56:11.930 --> 04:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
shorter than many that some of us have
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
sat through
 
04:56:16.368 --> 04:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
I think I I had one for 10 hours some
 
04:56:17.570 --> 04:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:56:19.970 --> 04:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
this was a little under four I think
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
that was pretty good and I appreciated
 
04:56:25.128 --> 04:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
the fact you all listened and took any
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
notes you wanted to and we'll be
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
bringing those up some of the things as
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
you look at those sections of the budget
 
04:56:34.670 --> 04:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for us to have
 
04:56:37.250 --> 04:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
everybody that comes to us wanting to
 
04:56:40.090 --> 04:56:40.100 align:start position:0%
spend more money that's usually the way
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
I think one time somebody came and said
 
04:56:45.410 --> 04:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
I think you should cut the budget
 
04:56:50.330 --> 04:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:50.340 --> 04:56:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:56:53.090 --> 04:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the fact you were all there
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and you were all patient and you all
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
listened and attentively and I think
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
that's what the public appreciates I've
 
04:57:04.128 --> 04:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
got to congratulate Joe who said time
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
and nobody argued that was also very
 
04:57:07.200 --> 04:57:09.410 align:start position:0%
and nobody argued that was also very
uncommon

04:57:09.410 --> 04:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
uncommon
 
04:57:11.690 --> 04:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
because normally we'd say time and
 
04:57:13.970 --> 04:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
they'd say I just got two more pages or
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
something like that and then I'd have to
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
say please wrap it up in about three
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
sentences and sometimes I was successful
 
04:57:23.930 --> 04:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
and then we also had to brief the
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
sergeant arms staff and they would start
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
moving slowly up the aisle to take the
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
person out but we're never allowed to
 
04:57:33.650 --> 04:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
grab them I'll put hands on them but
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
some of them finally took the hint that
 
04:57:40.250 --> 04:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay you've said enough and especially I
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
was glad that some people appreciated
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
the fact I was able to not everybody put
 
04:57:46.610 --> 04:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
who they were speaking for but when they
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
put what group they were speaking for I
 
04:57:50.330 --> 04:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
could group them together and then say
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay those are the three you're all
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing you don't
 
04:57:55.368 --> 04:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
need to say the same thing just if you
 
04:57:56.570 --> 04:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
agree or if there's something to add
 
04:57:59.570 --> 04:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
that was successful saved us probably 10
 
04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
or 15 minutes throughout the night so we
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
finished in less than four hours which
 
04:58:06.170 --> 04:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of a record so I appreciate
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
all the patience you had sorry I didn't
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
provide a meal I was thinking if if it
 
04:58:11.448 --> 04:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
was going to go real late I'd have to
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
order out but it went pretty well and I
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the attendance of this
 
04:58:18.650 --> 04:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee and the fact that you're all
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
willing to work so hard on this because
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
the budget is a challenge and it's game
 
04:58:24.890 --> 04:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
it came to us this is one of the more
 
04:58:28.250 --> 04:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
challenging times on this budget two
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
years ago we found that it was the
 
04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
governor's budget was 70 million more
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
than what ways and means told us this
 
04:58:38.810 --> 04:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
time Ways and Means was two weeks late
 
04:58:41.810 --> 04:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
and then told us they were 85 million
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
over what they said we could spend so
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
that left us right away trying to do
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
cuts and then when we had all those
 
04:58:48.480 --> 04:58:49.490 align:start position:0%
cuts and then when we had all those
bills

04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
52 of them all wanting to spend more
 
04:58:53.690 --> 04:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
money it's another challenge so I
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact you've all studied
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
very hard and tried to figure out a way
 
04:59:00.050 --> 04:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
to make it all work because that's what
 
04:59:01.610 --> 04:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
we have to do that's why we're here on
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
the finance committee that's why some of
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
us come back year after year to do this
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
because it is an intellectual challenge
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
that keeps us all on our toes and there
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
are ways we discover that yes we can do
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
this and it still looks good and maybe
 
04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
the house will will accept it one of the
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
things that shocked me in the past I
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
looked at what was called a tax
 
04:59:25.128 --> 04:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
expenditure limitation which I heard of
 
04:59:29.150 --> 04:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
in 2000 from people in Colorado they
 
04:59:31.550 --> 04:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
passed the taxpayers Bill of Rights in
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
it it said that a budget cannot increase
 
04:59:37.128 --> 04:59:37.138 align:start position:0%
over the past budget by more than
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
the rate of inflation plus the
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
population increase
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
so I've asked LBA tell me what that is
 
04:59:46.730 --> 04:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
here's the surprise in the two years
 
04:59:48.650 --> 04:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
prior to this budget
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
inflation was 12.7 percent
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
population increase was one and a half
 
04:59:54.480 --> 04:59:55.310 align:start position:0%
population increase was one and a half
percent

04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
those add up to over 14 percent
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think any of us want to increase
 
05:00:02.690 --> 05:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
a budget 14 plus we don't have the
 
05:00:02.700 --> 05:00:04.010 align:start position:0%
a budget 14 plus we don't have the
revenue

05:00:04.010 --> 05:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget was well short of
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
that and our budget will be even a
 
05:00:08.930 --> 05:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
little shorter
 
05:00:08.940 --> 05:00:10.490 align:start position:0%
little shorter
so

05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:12.770 --> 05:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
if you have talks with any of the other
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
members who might be thinking oh I don't
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
know if I want to vote for this inform
 
05:00:18.530 --> 05:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
them of the fact that what are you going
 
05:00:20.690 --> 05:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
to do with 12 and a half percent or
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
twelve point seven percent inflation
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
over the previous two years we've had
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
discussions about the
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
contract that the governor signed
 
05:00:33.010 --> 05:00:33.020 align:start position:0%
and I think we heard in in division one
 
05:00:35.690 --> 05:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
from administrative Services it's been
 
05:00:37.368 --> 05:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
signed you can't do anything about it
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's ten percent the first year two
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
percent the second year which
 
05:00:44.990 --> 05:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
now we discover that's that's pretty
 
05:00:47.810 --> 05:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
much what inflation's been so
 
05:00:50.810 --> 05:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
you've got to admit that and and kind of
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
stick with what we've been handed
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
and still try to find other ways to
 
05:00:55.798 --> 05:00:57.050 align:start position:0%
and still try to find other ways to
spend

05:00:57.050 --> 05:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
spend
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
um some people have said Gee do we need
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
all these employees what we've
 
05:01:02.208 --> 05:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
discovered through the years is is
 
05:01:04.128 --> 05:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
there's some more efficiency in in
 
05:01:04.138 --> 05:01:05.150 align:start position:0%
there's some more efficiency in in
government

05:01:05.150 --> 05:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
at one point there were a lot of people
 
05:01:10.850 --> 05:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
filling out a form handing it to someone
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
else to fill it out a little differently
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
handing it to somebody else now we have
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
information technology that you can fill
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
it out once and it gets populated
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
wherever it needs to be I am still
 
05:01:22.200 --> 05:01:23.330 align:start position:0%
wherever it needs to be I am still
waiting

05:01:23.330 --> 05:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
05:01:25.128 --> 05:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
and for about now
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
for the business one stop
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
which we've talked about some of us have
 
05:01:32.090 --> 05:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
heard about it for year after year after
 
05:01:32.100 --> 05:01:33.170 align:start position:0%
heard about it for year after year after
year

05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:01:35.570 --> 05:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
some years ago my daughter opened a ice
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
cream stand and I said ice cream shop
 
05:01:39.890 --> 05:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I said how'd that business One Stop
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
work she said what are you talking about
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
I said didn't you just fill out one form
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're crazy
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
I had to go
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
three places
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
on Health and Human Services
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
two three places on
 
05:01:59.530 --> 05:01:59.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
one place on uh dot entrances and exits
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
and one place where the uh Secretary of
 
05:02:10.610 --> 05:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
State to okay the name of the business
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
and see that it wasn't duplicated
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so
 
05:02:16.490 --> 05:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
I am told
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
by uh one of the people that works on
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing at the governor's
 
05:02:22.610 --> 05:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
office that now they have put out a
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
contract for business one stop
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
now I think the reason it was
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
it was uh slow walked all these 20 years
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
is because oh we don't want to lay out
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
this this receptionist we don't lay her
 
05:02:35.690 --> 05:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
off but we don't lay off this person
 
05:02:40.250 --> 05:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
that passes out the the uh the form so
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
that may save us a few jobs and and
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
these efficiencies should continue we've
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
got um
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know information technology working
 
05:02:50.690 --> 05:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
on that sort of thing and we will
 
05:02:53.090 --> 05:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
encourage them when they come into us to
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
keep it up
 
05:02:57.730 --> 05:02:57.740 align:start position:0%
because that has been what's made um
 
05:02:59.690 --> 05:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and everything else in
 
05:03:02.570 --> 05:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
this country far more efficient so look
 
05:03:05.208 --> 05:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
for those things and if they say another
 
05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
thing I've discovered is oh we've got a
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
lot of vacancies we've got a lot of
 
05:03:10.970 --> 05:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
vacancies but when I asked the treasurer
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
for account of the paychecks
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that short of what it had been
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
05:03:20.090 --> 05:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
so keep an eye on that I think it's
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
available to us the number of checks
 
05:03:24.050 --> 05:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
that go out and I think it's by by
 
05:03:25.550 --> 05:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
department so
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
if they come in and say we need a lot
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
more people and you say well you've got
 
05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
the same number you've had for years and
 
05:03:32.330 --> 05:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
you should be getting more efficient
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
every year so why do you need so many
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
people so look at those things in the
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
next week if you're going Page by Page
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
through the through the budget of course
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
as always the general fund pages are the
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
ones we have to pay the most attention
 
05:03:48.850 --> 05:03:48.860 align:start position:0%
to there are many things that are funded
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
by their own sources like Banking and
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
insurance and we hope the highway fund
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
will will keep the Department of
 
05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
Transportation going well
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
so maybe we don't have to put as much
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
general fund in there fish and game
 
05:04:07.310 --> 05:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
called me the other day to say that
 
05:04:09.788 --> 05:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
you know this 10 pay raise
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
they have their own funds they get them
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
through selling the licenses
 
05:04:17.448 --> 05:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
and they did have a great year a couple
 
05:04:19.550 --> 05:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
years ago when everybody was
 
05:04:21.410 --> 05:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't go anywhere because of kovitz
 
05:04:22.850 --> 05:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
so they all went hunting and then
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
fishing or whatever and so they had a
 
05:04:26.810 --> 05:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
very good year but it's it hasn't been
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
as as much since so they're starting to
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
whittle away at that Surplus they had
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't think they could afford to
 
05:04:35.810 --> 05:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
give the pay raise
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
the 10 pay raise to all the employees
 
05:04:39.530 --> 05:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
they have and they said the governor
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
promised them that it would come out of
 
05:04:44.448 --> 05:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
General funds so division two will be
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
working on that and I know
 
05:04:47.100 --> 05:04:47.810 align:start position:0%
working on that and I know
um

05:04:47.810 --> 05:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:50.208 --> 05:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
Mickey will be involved taking a look at
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
that and see if it in fact is in the
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
fish and game budget that that pay raise
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
is there
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
and so those those are the kind of
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
little knit noise that we've got to
 
05:05:01.730 --> 05:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
worry about I was very unimpressed with
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 and all the things that went in
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
there without in my mind very clear
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
thought when you say we don't need
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
surveyor licenses anymore and those of
 
05:05:14.690 --> 05:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
us that have been on a planning board or
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
dealt with the registered Deeds they're
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
damn well better be licensed surveyor
 
05:05:22.850 --> 05:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
stamp and license on that plan and name
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
so why do you think you can just easily
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
say oh we don't need licenses for
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
surveyors and that and similar
 
05:05:32.330 --> 05:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
throughout that oplc piece but we will
 
05:05:34.448 --> 05:05:34.458 align:start position:0%
be hearing more from
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
which will be helpful on what they
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
consider that and a lot of those things
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
are like one particular oh we never get
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
any complaints about them so why do they
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
need a license
 
05:05:46.920 --> 05:05:50.090 align:start position:0%
need a license
foreign

05:05:50.090 --> 05:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.100 --> 05:05:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:05:54.050 --> 05:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know oh if we don't have any
 
05:05:55.250 --> 05:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
complaints so we'd have to take your
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
license away why do they need a license
 
05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
well because somewhere is in the law
 
05:06:00.890 --> 05:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
some places in the law it might mention
 
05:06:02.930 --> 05:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
it and if you haven't looked all those
 
05:06:04.610 --> 05:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
places up
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
then and some of it might be in in town
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
ordinances I know a lot of that stuff on
 
05:06:11.690 --> 05:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
like the surveyor's license was in my
 
05:06:13.490 --> 05:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
town ordinance and and we'd have to look
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
at that at planning boards so
 
05:06:18.010 --> 05:06:18.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of little places we learn as we go
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's it's a great learning
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
experience for an old man like me that
 
05:06:25.368 --> 05:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
new things keep popping up give me a few
 
05:06:27.890 --> 05:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
more brain cells working so
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.208 --> 05:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
did you have any more comments
 
05:06:38.530 --> 05:06:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.170 --> 05:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
Vice chair does anybody plan to write a
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
minority report for those that had
 
05:06:43.920 --> 05:06:45.590 align:start position:0%
minority report for those that had
minorities

05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
minorities
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
if so we need to have it marked then we
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to have it
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
