on this
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair uh
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
nice to see you commissioner
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh i i love this one uh 580
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for better use
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
what is better use
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
what is better use
uh

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's a rather expensive term
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
better use i think that's a fair
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
criticism but i could use a half a
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
million for for better use yeah moving
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
it my way
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so basically what we're doing here
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
relative to this account is um having
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
looked at where we were relative to the
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
spending on this program um and seeing
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the upcoming ending of the grant
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
we are moving some of those funds around
 
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
we are moving some of those funds around
um

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know you'll see much of that
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
funding is is
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
passed through funding in terms of
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
federal grants and that's to the schools
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
so we're going to pass an additional 420
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
000 back through to the schools
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
um and then we're also going to be and
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we were not able to hire some
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
positions so we saved some money in
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
terms of attempt full time and we're
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to move that into both those funds
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
that transfer to the schools as well as
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
some contracts with
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
choose love and mostly unh for their
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
youth mental health first aid program
 
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
youth mental health first aid program
so

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
fair enough criticism that it's not
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily a better use but it is we're
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
trying to maximize the use of those
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
funds by putting them at programs that
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
we think are effective
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
if i could continue yes
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't it have been more
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you to say i have got
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
and these are the better uses i find for
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
that money categorically list those so
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
that we know where that money
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
money is going i mean we're we're budget
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
people we follow the budget
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we ought to know where the money is
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
being spent i think it's a fair
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
criticism and i agree thank you thank
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
you ben
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome are there any further
 
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.350 align:start position:0%
you're welcome are there any further
questions

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
is is this money related to the
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
one million dollars that dhhs
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh asked us to move last time where
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
where the purpose of that million
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars was to establish um clinical and
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
mental health care in some schools so
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
that would not be that is part of bdas
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
so the state commission on substance
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
misuse this is part of our system of
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
care grant from the federal government
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
through samsa
 
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.269 align:start position:0%

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i i i think i support this um i
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that if there's
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
a coordination issue between dhhs and
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
their million-dollar spend and and your
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
spend that that coordination happens
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't even know if it's
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's just that we're moving
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
big chunks of money in the last two
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal committees
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
towards school-based programs so i just
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're in sync okay
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels thank you thank you
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
can you define what a natural disaster
 
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
can you define what a natural disaster
is

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
i mean if i
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
if i have a well and suddenly i get a
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
break in my pipe
 
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.710 align:start position:0%
break in my pipe
because

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
the ground kind of gives way or whatever
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a natural
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
disaster it might be to me if i don't
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
have water right
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question senator so
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i have hard copies but i also
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
sent you all by email uh kind of
 
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.030 align:start position:0%
sent you all by email uh kind of
the

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
we call it one pagers for the drinking
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund this
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
information will also be on the website
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
soon as you approve so so the homeowners
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
know that that information too but the
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this is not to
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh pay for for low-income uh qualifying
 
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
uh pay for for low-income uh qualifying
uh

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
well owners uh things like that the
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance or gi had a lightning strike
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
and my motor needs to be replaced it's
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
intended to be for
 
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.310 align:start position:0%
intended to be for
um

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
irreversible water supply issues caused
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
by a natural disaster now that's where
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
it could be a earthquake it could be a
 
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
it could be a earthquake it could be a
hurricane

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
hurricane
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
that salinates water that wasn't before
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
it but it
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm not
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't defined what a natural
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
disaster is but it has to be something
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
that was not man-made not contamination
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
from a release of something but
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
that was caused by nature if you will
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
but it also has to be uh irreversible in
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
in scope so i'll give you a couple
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
examples again so
 
00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
examples again so
uh

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
let's say there's an earthquake that
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
drains the aquifer that your your well
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
is in so now you can't there is no water
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
for you to get that would qualify as an
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
example or again as i just mentioned
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
say your well is on the seacoast a major
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
hurricane comes through and now all the
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
water in that aquifer is
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
the salt content is too much to be
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
potable that would qualify
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
by way of background this is really an
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
off uh builds off of the
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
drought program that the drinking water
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund has been
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
operating for a while now uh in similar
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
we have similar contacts this is an
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
expansion of that because we realized
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
drought is a good example
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
but that's not the only example we want
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be prepared to be able to provide
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to our citizens
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
what's the income level you've
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
established to uh
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
to identify low income new hampshire
 
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.590 align:start position:0%
to identify low income new hampshire
homeowners

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh served by residential wells that's
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
and and how how do you ascertain whether
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's irreversible or not
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
right so thank you for that uh senator
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
so the last question first i think uh we
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
did we did give ourselves some some
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
leeway so to be fair what we said is up
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the department's discretion to
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
determine that but those are the the
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
type of examples i was giving uh so we
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
we tip we in the trust fund discuss this
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
as they were approving this the uh the
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
commission uh we don't want it to be
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
something like gee my my my motor needs
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
to be replaced those are maintenance
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
issues not not irreversible the water
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
supply is not available to you anymore
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
issues uh as far as the uh income levels
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
and again i'm happy to hand out two if
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
you want but we do have thresholds that
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
are built in that are very much based on
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
are currently still doing for the
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
drought program so it's based on uh hud
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
income guidance and then uh mhi and
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
within that we built tiers
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh for how much assistance uh will be
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
available to to folks if that helps
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and again
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
obviously for your constituents too this
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
will all be posted on our website
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
as a tool so
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't have any natural
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
disasters but in the off chance we do uh
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
you you can also if somebody ask you not
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
obviously feel free to call me i hope
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know that but you can also look
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
point them to the website and say here's
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
a potential assistance that can you can
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
get thank you thank you thank you madam
 
00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
get thank you thank you thank you madam
chair

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards uh thank you
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
madam chairman my my questions are sort
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
of similar but um let me let me let me
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
say it this way instead of in a form of
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
a question i i
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
whenever i see these kinds of programs
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
taking uh
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
public monies and sending it directly to
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
reimburse an individual
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
i get concerned about
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
the transparency and the openness of the
 
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
the transparency and the openness of the
process

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
process
because

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
some people are just better informed
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
than others and and so i i heard you say
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to be putting the
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
availability of this on your website
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
but do you think that's really
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient to make sure that
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
people who are just generally unaware of
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
public policy that that somehow we're
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
reaching out and letting them know that
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's a resource here for them as well
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you it's probably not
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient in a vacuum
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
all by itself but again i'll point to
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
our drought program so we have staff
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
that work that program
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh we try to target areas when
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when we are in severe
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
drought and that's
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know we just kind of got get out of
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
one it looks like we may be possibly
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
getting back into one for some areas of
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
the state so the state the the staff try
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
to do uh more targeted outreach also uh
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that the the the bene the good part
 
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.789 align:start position:0%
so that the the the bene the good part
of

00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
of this is
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's not really a hundred percent on
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
the homeowner because we're working with
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
the well drillers
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh so the people providing that actual
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
work for them and they're aware of it
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
also so so we have a little bit of a
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
multiplier in getting out the word so
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
when somebody
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve everything but when
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
somebody uh the drug program is getting
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
as my example is contacting the well
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
driller saying i i don't have enough
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
water what can i do with that type of
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
thing that the the driller
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
in this case knows in the equipment
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
suppliers are the same
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to offer that that program up
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
because that actually to be blunt for
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
them it helps get them a sale but also
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
helps provide that information to the
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
the well owner that this is available to
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
them even if they didn't know it
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise so so we are looking for other
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
outreach uh and again um
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's half the reason why i bring it up
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
to you that will be on our website
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
because i want you as legislators to be
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
also uh did you have a follow-up i i do
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
and and thank you because you
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated my follow-up about
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
contacting the drillers themselves uh
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so that sounds like a good approach
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
to me uh are you
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
confident that you're hitting a hundred
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
by and large yes i i i never want to say
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
we're a hundred percent for anything but
 
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
we're a hundred percent for anything but
uh

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
our understanding and working with them
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
because the well drillers you know we
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
regulate that so they
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
whether they want to listen to us or not
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
they they at least have to say they are
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh so so they have at least been made
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
available that information to them yes
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%

madam chair um
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
i i think i know the answer but i'm
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
compelled to ask because my school asked
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
me to ask um we did a school bond at the
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
auburn village school
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
and we put about seven hundred thousand
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
dollars into physical security upgrades
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the homeland defense
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
audit that we
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so my school would like to
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
participate in getting some of this
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
money to help with the 700 000 that we
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
spent a couple years ago is there any
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
provision for that or is that impossible
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
so in the public school infrastructure
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
fund grants that were initially provided
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
in 2018 those did include the ability to
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
do retroactive reimbursement for
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
amounts that had been already spent
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
towards qualified security projects
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the thing so auburn had
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
received 122 000 towards that at that
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
um in the current grant we do not
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be a
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
retroactive provision for school
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
projects that have already been done
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the objective in this next range of
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
money is to continue to
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
make our environment more secure so
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
while we appreciate that the communities
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
have already made those security
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
measures and brought those forward
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
in this grand tranche we're going to
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
continue to provide enhance and
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
improvements to that security further
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i think you kind of just said what i
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
told them up front which is we probably
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
can't ask for retroactive money but
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
with this funding if there are some
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
additional security items on their on
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
their list they can apply for it still
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely in fact that's what we're
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
hoping to see so we've got our security
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
plans in our schools those have been
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated through homeland security
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've identified
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
security risks in this grant process
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
which has not been you know finally
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission but the
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
homeland security and department of
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
education have been working on we
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate being able to rank those
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
security risks and we will fund the
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
highest risk items first thank you very
 
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:55.669 align:start position:0%
highest risk items first thank you very
much

00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further ques uh senator
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro thank you madam chair thank
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
you and thank you commission
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
commission the the money's available for
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
both public and non-public schools uh
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
tell me the realm that constitutes the
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
non-public venues
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
so what we're basically doing is we're
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
using the public school infrastructure
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
fund processes for this but we have so
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
far secured two and seeking a third
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
funding source that don't come with
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
those same limitations and so you've got
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
3.3 million dollars that is in the
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
and this is a as a result of funding
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
that was um not used out of the first
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
tranche projects that came in under
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
budget um and so that fund those 3.3
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
would be limited by statute to
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
only public schools the two other
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
funding sources that we're seeking are
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
arp arpa funds
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
which don't come with that same
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
restriction as well as eans funds so
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
emergency assistance in non-public
 
00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:56.710 align:start position:0%
emergency assistance in non-public
schools

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
which was the federal grant that was
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
designated for non-public schools and so
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we receive those
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to put that those funds into
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
the tranche and then we expect that we
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
will fund the highest risk projects
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
relative to students in new hampshire
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the question yes please go ahead and
 
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
for the question yes please go ahead and
a

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.789 align:start position:0%
a
uh

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
has a list been
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
compiled of all of the schools received
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
money initially and what they did with
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
that money it'd be who decides what the
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
height what's the criteria being used to
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
to to designate risk
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
so we do have a list and we can provide
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
that to you if you'd like to see that i
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
know for example manchester received uh
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
1.517 million in the first ranch yes um
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
so we can provide that to you that's no
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of what is going to be
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
funded in this next round is uh homeland
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
security and i don't know if you want to
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
speak to this gem but we'll go through
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a ranking process so we're going
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
to open up a grant window if you
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
remember in the last grant process we
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
did a rolling grant just to get that
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
money out and deploy as quickly as
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
possible in this tranche we anticipate
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
doing a grant window will allow the
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
grant applications to be received those
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
will be scored by homeland security in
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
terms of how risky they are and then we
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
will deploy that money according to the
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
grant source of the three different
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
sources and what's allowable under those
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
various sources
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
 
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
accept

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%

we now turn to still in tab 7
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office for emergency
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone taylor casual
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner gopher
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh is there a question yes uh
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman thank you madam
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
being here today so who sets the
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
60 40 rate as far as the
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide the match
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
a provision of this program that we
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
instituted in order to be able to
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
maximize the use of the
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
funds rather question if i could
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure follow up
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
so as you know we've heard from
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
communities like in getting emergency
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
funds they have to provide like 20 and
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
some have said that's not sufficient or
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have the 20
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case are you
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
confident that nursing homes can come up
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
required match or should it be higher
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
like again who is it the federal
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
government setting this 60 40 or is it
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
the state it's the state in this
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
particular program and we've done this
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
in a number of other programs in fact
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
the invest nh program has a match
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
requirement that's actually a 100
 
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
requirement that's actually a 100
requirement

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
this uh i think reflects the fact that
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
for the most part what we're seeking to
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
do with these funds are larger size
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
projects that require um a good amount
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
of work to be able to complete
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
whether capital investments
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investments pro you know
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
building renovations and those sorts of
 
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
building renovations and those sorts of
things

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
that given the arp of restrictions in
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
terms of timing really becomes a
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
question as to how far along
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
are the projects that we're going to be
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
able to fund at this point and be able
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
to see them complete prior to the
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
the termination of the arpa deadlines
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
so all of those pieces go together um
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
when we're looking for ways to make
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
investments that we can stretch the
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
dollars as far as we possibly can for
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
this particular instance and also be
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
able to recognize that
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
these are typically four projects that
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
have some level of maturity um and
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
effectively in a pipeline
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
already for the most part
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
of a couple of questions
 
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
of a couple of questions
um

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the there's been no
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
real specific
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
post coveted pandemic analysis
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
in long-term care facilities
 
00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
in long-term care facilities
done

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
 
00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.470 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
services

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
um there have been a couple of two years
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
in a row some legislative attempts
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money to do that to hire
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
an outside consultant but that has not
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and since
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
the department was not involved
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
in developing this program
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
what are you
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
basing the determination that this will
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
these projects will
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
mitigate the next pandemic
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
well i think a couple of things uh first
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
off i mean as we all know the long-term
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
care and nursing home
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
sector saw pretty significant impacts
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
um as we went through the pandemic and a
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
lot of those were
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and spreaders that were
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
occurring within those spaces with staff
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
residents and family members
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
we know
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're it's fairly well documented
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
that renovations that will allow for
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
additional spacing and safety measures
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
to be put into place as a general rule
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's covert or not flu other
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
viruses that spread through nursing
 
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
viruses that spread through nursing
homes

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
homes
this

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
funding provides us an opportunity
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
to make those investments for
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
covid type pandemics or future pandemics
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
and and really mitigate the risk that
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
comes to those very vulnerable residents
 
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.230 align:start position:0%
comes to those very vulnerable residents
so

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's the spacing with
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
renovations or whether it's making
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
investments that will significantly
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
enhance air circulation in a building
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
through hvac
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
these are all things that uh county
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
nursing homes have difficulty making
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
investments from a capital standpoint
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we're we're hoping that this program
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
advance those that are in that pipeline
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
significantly and really reduce the risk
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
without the participation of the
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
department and the subject matter
 
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
department and the subject matter
experts

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
experts
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
how how is
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
gopher going to be able to determine
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.909 align:start position:0%
what the
best

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
ranking of these projects will be to
 
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.350 align:start position:0%
ranking of these projects will be to
have

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
mitigating impact
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
well i i don't think it's fair to say
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we've not ever spoken with hhs
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
about this program but i think the the
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
fact is that this is a this is a
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
development program an infrastructure
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
investment program
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
into nursing homes that we know
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
are in need of these types of
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
investments and these this is an
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity again to take funding that's
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
available for this one moment in time
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
make those investments that are going to
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
last way beyond
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh any of us
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh i you know i
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
i feel fairly confident that the ability
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
to manage
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
what 10 or 11 nursing homes in counties
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and their infrastructure requirements is
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
within the capability of gopher but also
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
in you know we don't do these things in
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
a vacuum if there are instances where we
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
have to have input from other
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
departments we do that every single day
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
um

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
have you had conversations more follow
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
up on representative leishman's question
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
have you had conversations with
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties and what kinds of
 
00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties and what kinds of
assurances

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
assurances
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
have you gotten that they they are
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
willing to front
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
the 60 of the money
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
or will a lot of this 50 million be
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
i think i would say that this program is
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
designed to provide a tool to county
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that are in a position to
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
be able to use it um we know at least of
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
a couple that have um have expressed an
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
interest in the county nursing home
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
representatives have expressed support
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
for this program this is 50 million
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
dollars of investments
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we hope will be able to again make
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
those types of investments in the long
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
term for these nursing homes and their
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
one more if i could yes thank you
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
so the worst
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
devastation in long-term care
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
occurred at the veterans home where 20
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
of their residents died from coven in
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
two months why why
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
are you not including them
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
are they not interested does federal law
 
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.030 align:start position:0%
are they not interested does federal law
prohibit

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
us from
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
helping them with capital projects why
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
not go where the devastation was the
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
absolute worst well i mean i
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely acknowledge that i think this
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
program in the scheme of you know dozens
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
and dozens of programs that we've pushed
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
through is for specifically county
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in this instance
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
there may be a demonstrated interest in
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
moving a project forward for other
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
specific types of institutions such as
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
the one you refer to but this is a
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
county nursing home program
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh thanks manager i'd like to just drill
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
down a little bit more on one of
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald's question
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
have you specifically got a list working
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
with the department of health and human
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
services who works daily with
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes about their needs
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
or is this 50 million dollars kind of
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
like what you're putting out there and
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
then those with need will come forward
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
do you have like any specifics
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
we are basing the program in a
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
recognition that nursing homes uh
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
and the role that they play and that the
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
experience that they have been through
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
can be mitigated with investments in
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure whether it's hvac
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
new heating systems in some cases they
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
may want to be looking at efficiency
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
upgrades given what we're seeing in the
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
energy markets right now
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
but there are also
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
counties such as sullivan county that is
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
very far along and a very substantial
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation of their entire facility
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and this program would uh provide some
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
assistance in helping them achieve that
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
there may be other nursing homes that
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
have projects that are of similar size
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
or probably
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
much smaller in size
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
but from the standpoint of
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
making an investment to reduce the
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
potential transmission of covid or in
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
fact other
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
viruses within the nursing home this is
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make those investments
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair are there any
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
how will funding energy efficiency
 
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.630 align:start position:0%
how will funding energy efficiency
upgrades

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the spread of a virus as part of
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
an hvac upgrade um senator that you
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
typically you will want to make
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
investments if you're making a
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
significant investment in a in a new in
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
a new capital project that will
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
improve the air circulation and the
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
heating efficiency and cooling of a
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
building you're also going to make
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
investments in
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of the envelope of that
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
building in order to maximize the
 
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
building in order to maximize the
benefit

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
could we ask that
 
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
could we ask that
we

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
data that supports
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency projects mitigating
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
against viral transmission
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
if i could just continue on that point i
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
think that it's
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about making an investment
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the hvac
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
components of a building that in in
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
viral transmission will increase the
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
capability to reduce those
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
viral transmissions by circulating the
 
00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:13.349 align:start position:0%
viral transmissions by circulating the
air

00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of making those investments
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
for the air circulatory benefits you are
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
also going to achieve energy efficiency
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
benefits as a result of installing a
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient hvac system that's the
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
i guess we want to be reassured that
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
circulating the air around is not just
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to blow virus throughout
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
the facility that's why
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping you can provide us with that
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
backup data
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
which data specifically that shows that
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
these energy efficiency
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
air circulation projects will reduce
 
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.470 align:start position:0%
air circulation projects will reduce
virus

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
by its design a new hvac system that
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
will be used to
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
impart to circulate air is going to
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
increase the efficiency of the building
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chant
 
00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:26.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chant
uh

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner i i don't know a lot about
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
heating and air conditioning but my dad
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
was in the business all of his life
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
my brother was in the business all of
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
his life hvac
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
if you could promote air exchange and
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's the removal of the bad air and
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
bringing in a better ear that might
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
solve the problem but recirculating
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
than exist
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
at the moment because if you're
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
recirculating existing here what you're
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
doing is you're taking what's in that
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
air and just redistributing it over and
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
over again within the facility i agree
 
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.069 align:start position:0%
over again within the facility i agree
completely

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
so hvac uh
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
look at if you want to air condition the
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
situation that's that's one thing
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh that that's not going to save you any
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
money that's going to cost you money
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's a very expensive situation
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
i think the questions that uh are being
 
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
i think the questions that uh are being
asked

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
are really
 
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
are really
design

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
areas

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh figures out what they need to do
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
i would hope
 
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.750 align:start position:0%
i would hope
that

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:53.740 align:start position:0%
whomever the um
 
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.109 align:start position:0%
whomever the um
[Music]

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes choose to do whatever
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they would ensure
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that it meets the um safety standards
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
hvac but also for
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
space in rooms
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so i i
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
i understand where you're coming from
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
the gopher office
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
the gopher office
can

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
come to grips with
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
various nursing homes
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
might design their nursing home
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i assume that the counties
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
would work closely
 
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.829 align:start position:0%
would work closely
with

00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
dhhs because i know their
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
rules out there and all kinds of
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
things that they have to follow
 
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
things that they have to follow
so

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
is simply the money
 
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.829 align:start position:0%
is simply the money
to

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
allow the county nursing homes to move
 
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
allow the county nursing homes to move
forward

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
with required repairs
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents
 
00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:14.829 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents
senator

00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
gray thank you
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
having worked at the portsmouth shipyard
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
and worked on air handling systems for
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
submarines that submerged for three
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
months at a time
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
the new air handling systems and correct
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong allow you the
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do other things
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
humidification is one of the things that
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
we've done for years
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
electrostatic precipitators and other
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know items that would help to clean
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
the air
 
00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
the air
and

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate the
 
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
mitigate the
rebreathing

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
rebreathing
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know of the air so so
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
i mean
there

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
along with the air handling stuff that
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing the new system that you're
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
putting in it gives you the opportunity
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
to make those modifications to do those
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
other things
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
that allow
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
on fis 22 238
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank thank you madam chairman i i think
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
this feels like three different
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions but the first one up
 
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.829 align:start position:0%
questions but the first one up
is

00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
um 459 thousand dollars for a one-year
 
00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:54.630 align:start position:0%
um 459 thousand dollars for a one-year
license

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
license
for

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
just an interface
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a tremendous amount of
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
money are are we
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
getting some application licensing as
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
well or are we just really licensing
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
the interface component
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
this this is actually licensing
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
for the platform and the application
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
that that would serve as as many
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
citizens as as wanted to be served in
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire so it's
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
in other words it's it's it runs it's
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
basically for all of vinnie
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
all right follow
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay so when i read this maybe i'm just
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
suffering poor reading it just sounded
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
like all this was it was a licensing for
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the interface and not for the underlying
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
application if it's for that as well
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
then it sounds much better but okay um
 
00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
then it sounds much better but okay um
so

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
this is 459 000 for one year license
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
will this same amount
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
show up in the next budget cycle uh two
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
two times 459 is is that where we're
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
going with this yes sir um it's a timing
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
issue now where we didn't you know
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
during the planning of this biennial
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
budget um we hadn't considered
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we were running pretty quickly on
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
on public health response stuff and then
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
actually didn't planned into this budget
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
but the intent is on the dhhs side to
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes please is is this is this the
 
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
yes please is is this is this the
application

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
that you all did a uh privacy impact
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
assessment on i know that you got
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
engaged a contractor to do one pia
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
and and i i'm and i'm seeing a head
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
shake of a no
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
so um so i'm just curious uh
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
although this really great bill died
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
this year i i'm hoping that the
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
department still keeps moving in the
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
direction of doing pias on sensitive
 
00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.710 align:start position:0%
direction of doing pias on sensitive
uh

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
sensitive applications and this vaccine
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
registry has gotten a lot of people's
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
attention so
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
if if you were to do a pia on this would
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
you need supplemental money beyond the
 
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.109 align:start position:0%
you need supplemental money beyond the
459

00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
459
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
um so um thanks for the question um just
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
you can you can bring yeah david come on
 
00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
you can you can bring yeah david come on
up

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't don't struggle we're not
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you david weeders information
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
services director for dhhs
 
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.589 align:start position:0%
services director for dhhs
so

00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of doing privacy impact
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
assessments as we discussed in some of
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative bills that we were
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
working on we do not have sufficient
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
resources to do the robust privacy
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
impact assessments that would be
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
required for all of our systems however
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a robust security
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
process to look at all of our systems
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
this particular system
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
was developed by deloitte
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
on our sales force organization with our
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
team so it's really on our environment
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we've gone through all the security
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
practices to ensure that it's hipaa
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
compliant and follows all the
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
parameters that you would anticipate
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
from a pia or privacy impact assessment
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
were followed and we can certainly do
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
an overview pia on this this component
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine registration scheduling
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
and administration which is what this
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay just because it's my opportunity to
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
say one of my favorite quotes
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
that you you you you can you can have
 
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.430 align:start position:0%
that you you you you can you can have
um

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
secure and i can't even get the quotes
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
right now but anyways as you know
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between security
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
and privacy
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
and and you you mentioned security
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
primarily in your remarks so is do you
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
think it's also uh covering the privacy
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
aspects your security look
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question certainly our
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
privacy officer was involved through the
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
development of the application and
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing reviewing it from a privacy
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
perspective as well as a security
 
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
perspective as well as a security
perspective

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.430 align:start position:0%
perspective
and

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
just for this group's edification we are
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
looking at privacy by design in the
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
future so it will be privacy first
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
security second but you need both in
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
order to have a good system you need to
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
understand what you're securing why
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're securing it from a privacy
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
perspective and then you use security to
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
do it if that makes sense
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up so so i love that i love that
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
answer i i really do i i think um this
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
one's from mr glay
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
i i have mentioned a few times in fiscal
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee meetings and maybe an hhs
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
oversight that
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
we we're spending
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of money on a lot of
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
different i.t projects
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i keep coming back to the idea that
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to see a holistic
 
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.030 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to see a holistic
summary

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
summary
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
of all of the it project work that we're
 
00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
of all of the it project work that we're
doing

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
because as we just fund each one of
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
these i'm just concerned whether or not
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing the big picture the
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
aggregate of it and i i
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't the day to do that but i just
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
would like to encourage you to if you
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
have something like that already i'd i'd
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
be happy to come by your office and get
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with it
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes um in fact we are doing that right
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
now and we do it each each
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
in advance of the biennial plan a budget
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
planning process we do what's um called
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
an agency information technology plan
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
for each agency we work with the
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
agencies on the business side to do that
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
and that really talks about
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
from a business perspective what sort of
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
i t projects we're going to be doing or
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
planning during the
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
future biennium and our expectation is
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
that those plans align with budget
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
requests that that would be coming
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
through and we also take all of those
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
plans and we look at them and and use
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
them to guide our overall statewide
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
information technology strategy as well
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
so and i can share all of that with
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner in response to one of
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative edward's questions you
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh going forward you would be looking to
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
put this into the budget
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so i i refer to the last statement
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
on on your uh information to us in the
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
event the federal funds are no longer
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
available general funds will not be
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
wondering what it is if if we look at
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the that was a tough question to answer
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
because and i think
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's partly incorrect answer i'd have
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
to say um but
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
when we look at the funding mix in other
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
words our
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
if it's flowing through class 27 um
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
which is our the doit budget then the
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
funding mix for dhhs is is largely not
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh if it we're flowing through a dhhs
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
budget line and we haven't discussed
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
that specifically then again
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of that it would would likely not
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
be general funds as well so but it isn't
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
to be to be clear then your intent is
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine database to just go on
 
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
vaccine database to just go on
continuously

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh public health would like to have the
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
registration and scheduling capability
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
ready should we need it
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
when looking around the country i was i
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
i was in place as the uh president of uh
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
the national association of state cios
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and there
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
the the gold standard for states was to
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
have in terms of citizen service and
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
citizen response was to have a central
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
capability that that not only could
 
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
capability that that not only could
handle

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
handle
the

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
central registration from an efficiency
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
and a service perspective but also could
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
scale to the entire population and this
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
system does that for new hampshire thank
 
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.990 align:start position:0%
system does that for new hampshire thank
you

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
given that there's a patient
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
portion portal
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
um at least either in place or imagined
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
are there any plans to
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
have vinnie interface with
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
the commercial pharmacy market
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or other states
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
if somebody's living
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
in southern new hampshire
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
they can schedule an appointment at a
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is this would not be
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
used for commercial pharmacy scheduling
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
most of the commercial pharmacy
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
organizations have their own scheduling
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
emr system to do that and
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is really focused on scheduling
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
registration and
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
administration of
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines or associated with covid flu
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
and other vaccines that public health
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
so in the absence of a pandemic and i
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
believe the last one was quite some time
 
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
believe the last one was quite some time
ago

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
what benefit does this half million
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a year provide to the citizens
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question so
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're using salesforce for many
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
different components and having the
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
licensing allows us to leverage that
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
environment to build other applications
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
so in public health for example we're
 
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
so in public health for example we're
using

00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
salesforce for granite trace which is
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
our contact tracing patient monitoring
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
and case investigation system and we're
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
targeting other systems like our disease
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance system to be on the
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
salesforce platform so this specific
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
fund pays for the licensing for the
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
individuals in the immunization
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
group but it can be expanded and you
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
leverage across a larger enterprise
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
license agreement that we're negotiating
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
with salesforce to
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
reduce our costs over time
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
leveraging that one platform
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
so is it fair to say that this money is
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
really not dedicated to
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
the covid pandemic but rather to
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
building out a sales force system for
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
whom are there other uses you might
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
decide to
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
use it for
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would say we need this funds
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain the covet 19
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
solution if we didn't have the funds for
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
this we would have to turn that system
 
00:55:58.319 --> 00:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
this we would have to turn that system
off

00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
and then find else other funds in
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
excess of 459 000
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
to support all the other initiatives so
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is a component of what we can build
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
off of and so the idea is to not
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
duplicate effort and leverage this these
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
funds that are for covenant team to not
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
not just be wasted in the future but
 
00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:19.750 align:start position:0%
not just be wasted in the future but
also

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
be able to be leveraged for other
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
solutions as we go forward but it is
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
really right now for the kova 19
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic work
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
so i get that
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i also understand pandemics are
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
few and far between
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
whereas software changes dramatically
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
in years
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
much less decades or over the time over
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
turn of a century so the notion that
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're spending money on a lot of money
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
on salesforce licenses which will either
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
not be used
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
according to what you were just saying
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
or by the time you need the
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
what you're concerned about in terms of
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 or a similar type panda
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
endemic and some number of years out
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
there salesforce are probably out of
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
business and it's been some other system
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's come into place so i'm just
 
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.789 align:start position:0%
that's come into place so i'm just
wondering

00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:13.670 align:start position:0%
wondering
why

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
you think that this is a good long-term
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
investment i get the short-term needs
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
that you might use your sales for
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
salesforce licenses for for other
 
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.270 align:start position:0%
salesforce licenses for for other
purposes

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
but that's not what you're asking for
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
here that's not the funding you're
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
asking for here
 
00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:28.230 align:start position:0%
asking for here
so

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.470 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
not having a registration system in
 
00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
not having a registration system in
place

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
was a gap prior to covid so it was
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
something that public health had wanted
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
and had in their vision before this so
 
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.430 align:start position:0%
and had in their vision before this so
it's

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's valuable
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the context of a large-scale
 
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.910 align:start position:0%
outside of the context of a large-scale
pandemic

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's important it's important for us to
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes you may uh thank you madam chair
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay so during last budget cycle one of
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
we heard that was compelling
 
00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
we heard that was compelling
was

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
that we had a number of i.t systems that
 
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.829 align:start position:0%
that we had a number of i.t systems that
were

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
no longer being supported and as a
 
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.270 align:start position:0%
no longer being supported and as a
result

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
of their lack of support we were
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
increasingly subjecting ourselves to
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
some security risks
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
so when i see that we are investing in
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
the sales force platform i'm just
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
curious are are we are we executing the
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
plan that we talked about a year ago
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting off of vulnerable legacy systems
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
by migrating some
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
functions to
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
i would call salesforce a
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art kind of
 
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.349 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art kind of
application

00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes um that you hit the nail on the head
 
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.750 align:start position:0%
yes um that you hit the nail on the head
there

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
if we go out now on the modernization
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
effort if we go out to bid
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
for a new system for example or a
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
replacement of an older system
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
um it's highly likely that one that um
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
respondents will be using one of the the
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
two large platforms that are out there
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
today one of them being salesforce and
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other being microsoft dynamics 365.
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
you know case management which is what
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're kind of talking about here and and
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
also grants management potentially
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state our enterprise
 
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
throughout the state our enterprise
solution

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
is salesforce
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
so when we look at the you know
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
dhhs has multiple case management
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
systems the vision there is is to
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know over time to collapse those
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
down and leverage the licenses that
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
we've invested in across the agency and
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
across the other agencies as well there
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
are other agencies are very interested
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
in and have and are actually running
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion please
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move the item
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you

uh the item passes

and
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
if i am
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
not mistaken
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about not only
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh fis 22 240 in tab seven
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
but we're also going to talk about
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
242 in
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
tab 8
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
239 in tab 9
 
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.829 align:start position:0%
239 in tab 9
and

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
and
241

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
241
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
in tab
 
01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:39.829 align:start position:0%
in tab
9

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
9
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that because these are all
 
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
so that because these are all
interrelated

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
interrelated
 
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.150 align:start position:0%
interrelated
that

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
we felt that it would be
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
the best thing to
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
kind of get some sort of
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
central thought process on what's going
 
01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.870 align:start position:0%
central thought process on what's going
on

01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay um so i'm charlie arlinghouse i'm
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of administrative
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are two pairs of items right
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's a policy proposal and then the
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
then the money piece the actual thing
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 226 uh which uh passed and
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
was recently signed by the governor of
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
those we were preparing the documents we
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
weren't sure
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
created the possibility for the state to
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
do uh recruitment programs retention
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
programs etc and
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
that law requires fiscal committee
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
approval of a requires a division of
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
personnel of admin services to adopt a
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
statewide policy on both types of things
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
and then for any
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh iteration of such a thing
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
done by any agency
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for both of those things to come
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
before fiscal they're two separate
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
things so the two things that are later
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
in your agenda are the policies without
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
which these are not legal um so i'm
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to assume that if either one of
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
these passes you'll likely adopt a
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
policy that makes it legal
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
but the policies themselves are sort of
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
a broad structure
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think they require a lot of
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
explanation it's a lot of formal policy
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
work and uh matt maverick was sitting
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
behind me did a lot of the policy work
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
but if we have have legally questions um
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna drag him up here in particular
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
um so they're two different things and
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna talk about them from the the
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
smaller uh price tag one to the bigger
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
price tag one because they're very
 
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.230 align:start position:0%
price tag one because they're very
different

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of ways that people
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
retain employees or get employees today
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
and and you know
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
you see the signs of dunkin donuts you
 
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
you see the signs of dunkin donuts you
know

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
signing bonus or free donuts and we
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't do free donuts as a state but we
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
might do other things but the one of
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
them the the smaller item is which i
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
think is fiscal uh
 
01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
think is fiscal uh
242

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
242
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
referral incentive program
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
and the idea behind that is we need
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
employees and we're looking for them and
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways you get employees is
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
that people interview and they come in
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
the door so
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is something where we basically
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
turn the entire workforce into
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
recruiters for the state and that if you
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
if you get somebody to come work here
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for recruiting them
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
and it would be done on the application
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
as a formal way to do it to make sure we
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
don't run into he said she said things
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and we do actually hire the person that
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
there is uh there is a bonus both for
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
the new employee assuming you stay for a
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
while there's a bonus bonus both for the
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
new employee
 
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.710 align:start position:0%
new employee
and

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
for the referrer referrer
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
i think i said that right um
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's the one program and i think
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's the program that probably
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
everybody looks at and says okay this
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
isn't a bad idea because
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
we if we don't get anybody we don't
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
spend a dime
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
and if we uh if we end up spending money
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's because we we got employees that um
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
work through the system
 
01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:05.589 align:start position:0%
work through the system
um

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
the second thing and i think it's the
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
one that you're most interested in
 
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.670 align:start position:0%
one that you're most interested in
discussing

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.510 align:start position:0%
discussing
is

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
is
240

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
240
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
which is a retention incentive similar
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the programs that were done
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency this is
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
something we work directly with the
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office on
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
obviously you probably figured that out
 
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.710 align:start position:0%
obviously you probably figured that out
um

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
that given that it's a admin services
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
proposal and none of the money goes to
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
anybody who works at admin services
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
which i'm not complaining about by the
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
way but it's for direct care um direct
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
care people so it's basically you know
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital gun cliff center
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
center et cetera and the prison
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
obviously and the idea is that the the
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
staffing pressures there are a lot of
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
staffing pressures all across state
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
government but the staffing pressures in
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
in direct care positions is quite
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
significant right now and um
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
um this is something where you can't
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
just not do a policy or or or your
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
workload reduced at the end of the day
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
the prison has to function period i'm
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
using the prison as an example but this
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
works for all of them and they have to
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
function and if 10 people leave you
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
don't sort of curtail your operation and
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know have 14 of the prisoners work
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
from home
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
because that sort of doesn't work in a
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
prison and so the idea is to try to try
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
to retain the staff this would end up
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
applying to about um
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
um i think we have the numbers in on
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
page uh i don't have page numbers here
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
oh page six
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
so i think it's um
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
well i used to be able to see 1300
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
full-time 280 part-time people
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh those positions aren't all filled
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
obviously nobody would get a bonus if
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
the position weren't filled but we're
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting lots of them
 
01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting lots of them
um

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
so um you know about 15 of the state
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
workforce if you want to think of it
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
that way but the idea is to take people
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
who already work here and try to keep
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
them from leaving because one of your
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
best recruiting tools um is to retain an
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
employee and not have to fill it over
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
so that's that that's the idea behind
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
this and it's the it's the kind of
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
procedure that was done during the um
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency and i
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for the governor's
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
office but you know we worked uh hand in
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
glove with them to um
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to develop the program and and they have
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
a very strong interest and and as do
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh people in these departments obviously
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
in trying to trying to keep employees
 
01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:27.190 align:start position:0%
in trying to trying to keep employees
and

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
and reduce staffing shortages
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think the price tag is all laid out
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
some for full time some for part time if
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
that helps if that's a question people
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
might wonder about right
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
the idea is to make part-time positions
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
eligible in both of these cases for
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
things as well
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in state government is
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
about five years ago um i went and
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
visited uh i think mr gilley
 
01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
visited uh i think mr gilley
after

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
use the state's
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
employment website
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
to search for
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
jobs of different categories just to see
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
how it the look and feel works for a
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
typical potential employee
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
five years ago
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
we were using i think a free application
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
that was just horrible it wasn't worth
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
the money we were paying for it i'd like
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
in the five years
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
has the department been able to get a
 
01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
has the department been able to get a
professional

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
job recruitment website up to where
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
people can effectively search for
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies and and qualifications and the
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
like like if they're a veteran
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
can they find out which jobs are open
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know preferences to veterans for
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
example do we have a good website or is
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
it still a five-year-old stinker i um
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's not still a five-year-old stinker
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
but um the the question do we have a
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
good website or is it a five-year-old
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
stinker presumes um two options and
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
there are lots of options in the middle
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
of that range
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
i think we have a good website what
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're using now is the is the talent
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
management module talent management is
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
what the those those kind of people all
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
use to
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
talk about hiring um the talent
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
management module of the infor system
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
which is the state's erp system that
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
governs our finances payroll et cetera
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to integrate the two um
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
we have since about um
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
october of 2017 made significant changes
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
um to that website and and
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
basically we had a meeting where the
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
the governor decided to do what you did
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
too and he tried to apply for a job and
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think we rejected him and he was
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
unqualified for
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
um a cleaner position he applied for
 
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
um a cleaner position he applied for
and

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
he had trouble applying
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things was the the
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
different browsers you can use to access
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
it and we've changed that
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
i would say every few months we have a
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
team that
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
regularly looks at this the
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
the the hrp section of
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
fdm which is one of our divisions that
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
manages the enterprise system and so we
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
make changes um all the time
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
i would say that where we are today is
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
that it's
better

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's getting better and it gets
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
better every day but when we talk about
 
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:51.460 align:start position:0%
recruitment i um
 
01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.430 align:start position:0%
recruitment i um
[Music]

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
i ask um i told you this before that i'd
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
interview everybody we hire um lately
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
and so you know think of it as maybe
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
maybe over the last um nine months about
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
100 people
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
um that have sort of passed through and
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i ask almost all of
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
them it sort of depends how the
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
interview's going is how did you find
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
applying for a job how did you find
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
interacting with the state
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
and and i would say that um
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's still a range on that and i what
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased about is that there are a
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
number of people it's a particularly
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
important thing externally right and and
 
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:26.740 align:start position:0%
um you know in the state system
 
01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
um you know in the state system
[Music]

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 30 percent of the people
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
come external and 70 are
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
are moving from one state job to another
 
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.149 align:start position:0%
are moving from one state job to another
um

01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
but people who who are familiar with
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
applying for jobs in the market today
 
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.270 align:start position:0%
applying for jobs in the market today
are

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
more optimistic about our system because
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
with so many larger companies in
 
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.709 align:start position:0%
with so many larger companies in
particular

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
there are systems you sign up you
 
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.669 align:start position:0%
there are systems you sign up you
register

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
you create an account and all of that
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and that's the that's the
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
pain of the process most of the jobs
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
i've applied for in my
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
entire life have been resume and cover
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
letter sent sent through the us postal
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
service to somebody and so you know i
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
would so i find the system horrifying
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
and and freakish
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and um well don't
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't say that when alex is here but the
 
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
don't say that when alex is here but the
um

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
but if you're used to this if you're
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
used to applying for jobs electronically
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
you're much much more used to it now and
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
so what i would say is we're getting
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
better and i would hope that we're at
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
about a b minus at this point
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
and um which is unacceptable because i
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
think we lose applicants because of it
 
01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:32.229 align:start position:0%
think we lose applicants because of it
um

01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
but we get better all the time
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
if i was an employee and you were trying
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to retain me you give me a two thousand
 
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.270 align:start position:0%
to retain me you give me a two thousand
dollar

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
dollar
retention

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh bonus i guess uh it looks like the
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is that i stay for 90 to 180
 
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
requirement is that i stay for 90 to 180
days

01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct there's a uh yeah
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's a time frame i don't i don't
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
know what the exact uh difference
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
between the two dates is but july 1st to
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
november 3rd
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
so you have you you have to be here on
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
july 1st and you have to stay through
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
november 3rd
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this is probably like 125 days
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
one of the other items i mean one of
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
them mentions new hires and
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh that's on the referral yes that one
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
sorry and then there was one for
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
retention which mentioned 180
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
90 to 180 days
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
when when that time is over is the
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
expectation that this retention bonus is
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to continue
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
or are we just paying somebody that's a
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
one-time payment okay so the think of
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
the on on a referral uh think of it this
 
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
the on on a referral uh think of it this
way

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
way
um

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know i've got an open position uh
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm interviewing right now for a cfo if
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
you're interested
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
and um you come in you apply for the job
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that that that oh let's
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
just say matt matt recommended you on
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
your job application you say recommended
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
by met maverick george if we hire you
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
the clock starts ticking and i like
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
nudge matt and go hey let's see if he
 
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.950 align:start position:0%
nudge matt and go hey let's see if he
stays

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
stays
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
and then if you stay you stay through
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
the time you're supposed to stay then
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
you both get a check
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
you don't get another check in six
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
months you don't get another check six
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
months after that it's now and we're
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to see if that works on some basic
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
level this is an experiment
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
to see if that really does in fact make
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
a difference i by the way i suspect it
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
does or you know mcdonald's and dunkin
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
donuts and
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know lincoln financial and everybody
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
else wouldn't do it too
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
yes and that's not not my question my
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
question is specifically about the
 
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
question is specifically about the
retention

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
part not not not the referral uh no
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
retention same way we're asking you to
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
asking you to stay and then and it's a
 
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:53.450 align:start position:0%
one-time payment yes and
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
one-time payment yes and
[Music]

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
so basically we are paying somebody two
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to stay 90 days
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the i think i i think if you think about
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
it sort of philosophically the idea is
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
to to
um

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
you know there's obviously obviously not
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
a long life to this you you can't do
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
that where you you every quarter for the
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
rest of their career you give somebody
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
you just give somebody two grand if they
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
make it another quarter in another
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
quarter because if nothing else that
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
just becomes part of base pay but it's
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
basically right now we're in a we're in
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
a time period where where there's a lot
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
of churn
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of issues in hiring
 
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.350 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of issues in hiring
people

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
and um and uh and that's particularly
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
true you know i don't speak for hhs or
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
corrections but it's particularly true
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
in some of those areas we talk a lot
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
about nurses but it's not just nurses
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's a you know direct people who do
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
direct care and work sort of
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
um in care or behind the wall or
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
whatever have you
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
and and that's where there's a lot of
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
pressure and and the idea is to um in in
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
a in an uh
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
a time period of high vacancies is try
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
to keep that from exploding
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
and to try to keep a lid on it
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that aren't
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
ideal right now and this is one of them
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay and i understand that i guess i
 
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
okay and i understand that i guess i
just

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
question because it doesn't seem so
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
90 to 100 or you say 125 days is an
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of time
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
for the for the money that you that
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're putting out i mean it basically
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
equates to like six thousand dollars a
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
year if it were continuous but
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
for some for someone that was looking to
 
01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
for some for someone that was looking to
leave

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know to stay for 90 days i'm not
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
sure really what it's giving us
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a no so it's a good question one
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the things when you're constructing a
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
program like this and and you think of
 
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
program like this and and you think of
the

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know i said we worked with the
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office on this and frankly
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know where the governor's office
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
started is is we want to do something we
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
want to we want to and in in this realm
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they look for recommendations on
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
time periods it's an argument to be made
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
for 30 days that i think it's too i
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
think it's too short but there's an
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
argument to be made for a year
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to give you any money
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
unless you unless you unless you stay
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
for another year
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
and um and probably
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know every number in between i think
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
the the the finalists for the time
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
period that we considered are probably
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
three months and and six months
 
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:20.810 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
and um
[Music]

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's one of those things you
 
01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's one of those things you
know

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm honest we're you know there's no
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
science around us and so we're we're
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
making a judgment call
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
comic relief at times that's appreciated
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
so as i understand
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
you're all in all four items i believe
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
you said that we have a vacancy rate
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is approaching 20
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh people are leaving at a roughly 12
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
percent um
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
what are we doing for incentives to
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
keeping people here i understand that
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
arpa funds are going to be used for
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
people that take care of prisoners and
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
services areas but what about dot and
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
des are there any funds available
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
for retention of those departments for
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
instance or even your department
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
no so it said it's one of those things
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a sort of an obvious
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
comment to make when you're retaining
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
direct care people um which is you know
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of so
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
accountants don't matter
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
and uh um i say that because i have a
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
lot of accountants um but um and it's
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
not true and the thing is that you know
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
you can make a case for doing this with
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
basically every profession in the state
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
every worker group in the state and um
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know i would love to do it for
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
building service workers um i've talked
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
to you in the past about about that
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
issue we're doing a lot of things to try
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
to recruit and retain people and there's
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
a you know we we've uh gave the lb a
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
chart and if we i know we're you're
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to want to talk later about
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates and all of that and and
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
what the recruitment unit is doing and
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
but um one of the things is that in a
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
in a climate where we are where we are
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
today there are there are some things
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
you can do and some things you can't do
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
i think that bonuses of this nature are
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
meant to be by their
 
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.750 align:start position:0%
meant to be by their
uh

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
nature i guess
 
01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:30.709 align:start position:0%
nature i guess
extraordinary

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
right and not not structured in such a
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
way that they would become commonplace
 
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
way that they would become commonplace
um

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
so what you're what you're left to doing
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you want to retain good people that
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
you have is you try your damnedest to do
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
it and if you are you know there's an
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
incentive part of the incentive is i
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
think every manager wants to be a good
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
manager in part because they i would
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
hope are
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
nice people
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
but part of it is um
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult when somebody
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
valuable to you leaves and frankly when
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
you have 80 percent of your position
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
filled everybody's pretty valuable
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
um when somebody leaves there's an
 
01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
um when somebody leaves there's an
enormous

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
time crunch and difficulty with them
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
leaving and so a lot of what you do is
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
you you try to make sure you run around
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you're nice to people
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
you try to emphasize the things the
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
state does well you know the state you
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
know state wage scale is a little bit
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
lower um say benefits are really good
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the time off is really good and you
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
make sure you work with people and you
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that they can utilize the time off and
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know which is a which can be a
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
burden if somebody took all the
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know 10 or 15-year employee took
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
every every annual day every floating
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
holiday and used up all their sick leave
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's it's um it's like 20 to
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
25 percent of the year they could they
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
could miss
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and you have to work with that
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
and so and so that's a lot of it you
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
know the frankly the things that that
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
anybody can do at any company or any any
 
01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
anybody can do at any company or any any
unit

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
to try to keep employees
 
01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.910 align:start position:0%
to try to keep employees
um

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
um
are

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
human more than financial i mean don't
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
get me wrong
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know financial hi um you're offering
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
me 70 the other job's offering me 95.
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
guess which one i'm taking
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's an issue but if you can get into
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
the conversation then a lot of it is is
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
they need to think that they're that's a
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
good place to work and it needs to be a
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
good place to work
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
responses we've been getting have been
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
much better and i just want to
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
tackle that as well your uh recruiting
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
and retention efforts and the attachment
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro thank you very much
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair i think the the information
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
that you've presented to us is really
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
outstanding and i can recall when we had
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
these discussions about pharmaceuticals
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to see something very
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
positive happen as a result of those
 
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
positive happen as a result of those
discussions

01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the course of our discussions they said
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
we could save money there was a
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
methodology in place to do it and we
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
could do it hopefully
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
that same situation will occur in the
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention part so that
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
we'll retain corrections offices and be
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to recruit so that our overtime
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
be lower and uh we'll be able to fill
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
those spots so kudos to the department
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for uh paying
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%

the sununu youth center
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
but in it there was also an allegation
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we are picking up on sexual and
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and i think the
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
corrections department
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%

if there is abuse that it stopped
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i and whether or not you think we do
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
have a situation where we've got some
 
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.030 align:start position:0%

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
and moving forward that your sentence
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
does not equal sexual assault and
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
creating pathways for that communication
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
and we have dedicated what are called
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
pria investigators that investigate
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
allegations of both residential resident
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
resident to staff
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and numerous variables under the federal
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
pria law in addition to that and
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
thankfully so governor council also just
 
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
passed a contract will allow us to
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
further create both educational videos
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
of residents who've been incarcerated
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
and staff staff education materials
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that will continue to elevate both our
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance education in response to
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
allegations of sexual assault during
 
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.189 align:start position:0%
allegations of sexual assault during
incarceration

half of funding that already has gone to
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
virtually every community in the state
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%

a week ago
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
and we really didn't want a delay in
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
moving those funds forward
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%

indicated their willingness and they've
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
were had all the appropriate paperwork
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
taken care of to move that it's just a
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
simple matter of
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting those funds transferred to those
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%

written plan nearing completion i was
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious what that all meant
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
just to
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
to keep for continuity throughout this
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%

it's just that was just
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
along the way as it was being developed
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%

the notes
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%

several rules that show up in here
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
several places
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
the licensing rules have all been
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
updated and completed those are in place
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's chapter 700
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the

the rules pertaining to
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
the enforcement policy
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
which would be like sanctions and fines
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so forth as well as the um
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
the hearings and procedural process
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
and just one quick further follow-up
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
so during the review of legislation last
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
year we learned that reports that
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
everyone thought were going to
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal or finance were going to mr hunt
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
over in commerce is that all
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
straightened out now are those
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
being forwarded to the chair of the
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
good morning deputy chief danielle
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
elston with new hampshire liquor
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement um we are still sending them
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
to commerce we can send them direct to
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
the chair of fiscal if we need to we
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
continue to send them to commerce uh the
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
the direction for
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
the report came out of commerce um but
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
if we can continue we can send them to
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
the chair fiscal if that's what
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
what we choose yeah i think that was the
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
agreement i was at the commerce
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee when it came up and i think mr
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
hunt said he thought they would should
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
go to finance or the fiscal chair
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you we can send them

but
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh okay so so mr ribson i i'm looking at
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh unresolved item number one and when i
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
go read what it says it says
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
this is the legislature's issue to solve
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious since it sounds like
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
there are several statutes involved
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
are you working with the legislator for
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for the coming term next
 
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.149 align:start position:0%
legislation for the coming term next
term

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
and if so who
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
at this point um i'm unaware of any
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislative interest in addressing item
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
number one i i think we're obligated to
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
be interested right i mean you know you
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
i okay so so we'll talk about that uh
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
offline but
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
um but i i i've been getting involved in
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
the sununu center a lot in the last
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
couple years so i i could help you with
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
then on uh item six
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh observation six it says
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and institute comprehensive
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
performance measures after the strategic
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
plan is done it looks like your
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
strategic plan is now done
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
do you have any roadblocks to keep you
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
from fully resolving observation six
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah what we've what we've said in both
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
both the strategic plan
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
these things were all done anticipating
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
um that we would be moving forward the
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that was being considered
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
this this past session in terms of
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
moving into the new facility
 
01:41:28.239 --> 01:41:29.189 align:start position:0%
moving into the new facility
um

01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
changing the the clinical program
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
everything aligned with that so
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're in a little bit of a limbo right
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
now as to how to actually operationalize
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
and whether to operationalize those
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
things because we're not quite sure
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
what the future holds
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're currently in a moment where
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
state law would have the facility close
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
in march of 2023 with absolutely no
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
alternative in place
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm just playing check
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
marks with you now you've got a check
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
mark and substantially resolved as i
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
listen to what you're saying sounds to
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
me like you're partially resolved at the
 
01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:01.750 align:start position:0%
me like you're partially resolved at the
best

01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah well we have we had the plan laid
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
out in place was all incorporated within
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
the a m plan and incorporated in our
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities but to move forward
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of understand what's
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
what the future holds all right uh thank
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
you for your indulgence madam chair oh
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
no no problem
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'll now
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
try again
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
just a a quickie
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the report that we got from hhs
 
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.629 align:start position:0%
in the report that we got from hhs
um

01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
just the the
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
the numbers are so tiny that i can't
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
read them and i've talked about that
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
they've got to do something if they're
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to give us information
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
make the information readable
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that we can get something out of it i
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
realize it's not your
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility but i've been looking at
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
these things for a number of years
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they've gotten smaller
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
as the years have gone by
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
my eyesight has not improved
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
substantially so
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've got to make a change there yes
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've got to have that i believe
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
that senator rosenwald has agreed
 
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.109 align:start position:0%
that senator rosenwald has agreed
to

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
she and i
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
working on an overhaul
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
of this report oh great over the summer
 
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.790 align:start position:0%
of this report oh great over the summer
sherlock

01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
sherlock
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we need more well we will not have
 
01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.629 align:start position:0%
yeah we need more well we will not have
any

01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we will not have any sherlock
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
holmes magnifying glasses
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
but that's necessary but um
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
we want the report to be useful yes and
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and so
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
we'll come up with something right and
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
my second point is
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the recruitment and retention we
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
were going to get a report
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
either periodically or
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
meeting every other meeting but as to
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
what's happened how successful it's been
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
what's happened to the number of
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
vacancies how many have been filled
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
and uh how that how that's going just to
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
keep us all abreast of how things are
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
moving and i'm particularly interested
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
in that i sponsored the bill
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh happy that it obviously passed but
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
but indeed we should be kept up to date
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
as to what's going on
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
so mr arlingham you you'll provide that
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
for july
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
we do uh just to cut into madame chair
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
we did send an email from charlie with
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind of an update i think some of the
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay go ahead
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm i must have missed the
 
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm i must have missed the
email

01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
oh you mean you mean while i was driving
 
01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
oh you mean you mean while i was driving
down

01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted me to uh
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.709 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%

perfect
person

01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think we should talk about it since um
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay with me our uh kate mullavy is head
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the recruitment unit our new
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
recruitment unit and matt mavrogeorge is
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
a director of personnel
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
the deputy director personnel boy lori
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
would just kill me right and i won't
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
tell you which is which but you might be
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
so a couple things there's so there's a
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
document in front of you that that kate
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
prepared which is the numbers the only
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
change from the thing that we sent
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
before is that the vacancy rate is 20.6
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say that doesn't matter
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
but there's a chart in the back i think
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's page four that kind of shows what's
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
happening but what's going on is not
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we're anticipating making immediate
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
changes that will affect a rate
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of things i remember
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know back in the day people would
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
ask about you know we're talking about
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
economic development or budgeting or
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
something like that and someone said
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
what's the one thing we need to do
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i said the one thing we need to do
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
is to stop thinking there's one thing
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
that we need to do
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no one thing that's
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
going to make a difference on anything
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
and this is true of any major project
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
you have but on recruiting in the state
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
we're not there's not one thing that
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're not doing if um if something
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
happened and you saw immediate movement
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
it would be because oh it turned out we
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
forgot to flip a switch and now we're
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
getting eight times as many applicants
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
no there are a lot of little things
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um kate and her team of
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
three people and and matt is a integral
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
part of this um are working on doing a
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
lot of things and if you look at the
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
bullet points on major milestones a lot
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
of them you're going to look at and say
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't sound like that big a
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
thing but everything is a big thing
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
everything's a little thing and all the
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
little things start adding up
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm going to give one
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
example that i'm directly familiar with
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
from from a few years ago
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
from from a few years ago
we

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
we
um

01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of building service
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
workers which is a part-time position
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
doing cleaning
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of them based in the city
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
of concord
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
who are not native english speakers a
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
lot of them are
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
from from immigrant communities or new
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
americans or
 
01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
americans or
um

01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
or refugees or what have you and
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
it turned out that you know the typical
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
way of recruiting for a position like
 
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.189 align:start position:0%
way of recruiting for a position like
that

01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
um doesn't really work
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
but we had we have a number of people
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
inside those communities who we did
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
flyers and at some point somebody did a
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
flyer and had one of them
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
translated into
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
nepali i'm going to say but i might be
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
wrong about that
 
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.109 align:start position:0%
wrong about that
and

01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
and passed it out it helped we got four
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
or five applicants that we didn't have
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
and it's the whole thing about word of
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
mouth one little thing that made a
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
little tiny difference it doesn't affect
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
any data point or our numbers but for
 
01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
any data point or our numbers but for
the

01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the buildings that started getting
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
clean that weren't well they were
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
getting cleaned but the pressure on the
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
on the building crew that made a
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
difference so everything we're doing is
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
designed to make a little bit of
 
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
designed to make a little bit of
difference

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i think we're i think we're getting
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
there there is a data point in here that
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
shows you
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
what happens i talked to you before
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
about how this how there's a churn so i
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
think it's page two net hires by pay
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
period we hire people we terminate
 
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:47.990 align:start position:0%
period we hire people we terminate
people

01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
termination just means they left it
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they got fired right you
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
retire your your position is terminated
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
and all of that and you you see the net
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
number is negative a lot of times we've
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
had positive we've had negative we
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
actually had a really good
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
pay period we hire on fridays i think
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
people know that everybody starts work
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
on a friday
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
before i came to fiscal i actually wrote
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
an email to my department about the
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
five new people who were starting this
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
particular friday and saying make sure
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
you wave and say hi to them as you walk
 
01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:17.189 align:start position:0%
you wave and say hi to them as you walk
by

01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
and um so everybody starts on friday and
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is what happened on the last
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
30-ish fridays
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be analyzing that data
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
and kind of figuring out how that works
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day one of the things
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
recruitment is going to be a little bit
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
like curling
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
for us as a state
 
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
for us as a state
and

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
there are national trajectories that are
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing and we're gonna we can sweep to
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
i don't you know watch curling at the
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
olympics right you sweep and you kind of
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
move it a little bit this way or a
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
little bit this way so we're trying to
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
move it a little bit this way nobody's
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
gonna flip a switch and we're go we're
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
gonna go from 20 and next month i'm
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to come to you and go hey it was
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
20.4 last month now it's 8.5 wow we
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
hired like a thousand and six people
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's just never going to happen so
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping to do is to reverse
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
that trend
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
that trend is only reversed by a lot of
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
hard work by hiring managers
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's to some extent um hard
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
work by the people to my right but
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
to some extent to a large extent it's
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
them helping other people get the work
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
done we're going to certify positions
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
faster you apply for the state job you
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
get certified you get an answer faster
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
you get
 
01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.709 align:start position:0%
you get
um

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
disposition faster so you know you got
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
the job you know you didn't get the job
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
we encourage those people to apply for
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
other jobs in the state system and you
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
can see here that some of the some of
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the research work done you know we found
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
people who were interested in a state
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
job and didn't get one and then just
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
sort of languishing out in the ethernet
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere and and moving that forward
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
and so that that's the big picture on
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
kind of where we're going and and i
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
think it's going to get worse before it
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
gets better
 
01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
gets better
but

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're finding a lot of a lot of things
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
to work on that are that are making
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
those small differences that we need to
 
01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.830 align:start position:0%
those small differences that we need to
make

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.629 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent emery
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
pressures of inflation and
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
do you think we're going to see some
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
retirees coming off the bench
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
to come back into at least part-time
 
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
to come back into at least part-time
employment

01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
well the short answer is i hope so i
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
mean we have
 
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.629 align:start position:0%
mean we have
um

01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
we have a number of people this this
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
happens a lot lately i mean it happened
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
in state service for a while but um
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know i i have a i have a guy who is
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
um you know he's passed social security
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
full-time age and um well so i i think a
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
lot of people here know you know mike
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
connor who retired as deputy
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner in 2017 and did everything
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
and anything to do with property and
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
public works and procurement and and was
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
an institution in the state so he
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
retired we got him to come back part
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
time and i'm making sure to drop by and
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
explain to him that you know if you wait
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
till you're 70 to take social security
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
it goes up eight percent a year those
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
three years just so you know
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
and to kind of put that off um we try to
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
do a lot of that we have uh you know i
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
see a guy in the in the basement all the
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
time who um used to work for weights and
 
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.189 align:start position:0%
time who um used to work for weights and
measures

01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
measures
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
in in the department of agriculture and
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
he's and there aren't that's a thing
 
01:52:25.679 --> 01:52:26.470 align:start position:0%
he's and there aren't that's a thing
where

01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't i hadn't even heard
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
the term metrologist
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
before uh before i started looking at
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
the state budget and they have a new
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
metrologist and this guy is on board
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
because there aren't a lot of them and
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
he's uh he's 25 30 hours a week and
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
we talk and when i see him in the
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
basement about retiree health a lot
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can with that
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think it i think it's an effective
 
01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
i think it i think it's an effective
solution

01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
in some
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
managerial positions it requires you
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
just to rethink how you do things
 
01:52:57.599 --> 01:52:59.270 align:start position:0%
just to rethink how you do things
where

01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's an old-fashioned attitude that
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know everybody i have i need to have
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
full time
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
and um you get used to like well what i
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
really need is another is another you
 
01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.189 align:start position:0%
really need is another is another you
know

01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
another fred
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe what you need are two half
 
01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:13.990 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe what you need are two half
fred's

01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
fred's
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
and and and by the way just for the
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
record two half reds are actually
 
01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
record two half reds are actually
cheaper

01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so and if it happens to be a fred
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
who actually knows what they're doing
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know i have a some of you may have
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
met um joe bouchard before and i had a
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with him on his last day
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
which didn't go anywhere but i said just
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
once the summer's over and you're tired
 
01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the black flies biting you up in
 
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.669 align:start position:0%
of the black flies biting you up in
maine

01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we could work something out
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
because you'd because i'd grab a guy
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
who already knew what the heck he was
 
01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.030 align:start position:0%
who already knew what the heck he was
doing

01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
instead of bringing somebody in and
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
having to train them and go okay so the
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
budget this is going to sound weird to
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
you but
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
and because he already knows all the
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
weird stuff and so it's easier so
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for this report
 
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.189 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for this report
oh

01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:54:09.199 --> 01:54:10.709 align:start position:0%
oh
representative

01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair could you just
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
remind me what a
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
non-classified position is and how many
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.790 align:start position:0%
there are
um

01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes sort of
 
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.510 align:start position:0%
yes sort of
um

01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
so the entire state workforce almost
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
without exception is divided into
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified unclassified
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
are largely the gnc appointments but a
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
couple other categories
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's staff is non-classified
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
their salary they're not budgeted at
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
anything he could theoretically pay one
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
guy 500 grand
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
and somebody else six
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's an argument i made when i worked
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
there didn't go anywhere but
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
legislative employees are also
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
non-classified it means they're not part
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
of any system and they're not part of a
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
scale they tend to be
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
weird one-offs here and there
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
and in the executive branch there's
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
almost none of it except political
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
appointees historically it was meant to
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
be used for people who are
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
political appointees and and serve at
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
the at the whim of somebody else and fit
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain categories under federal fll
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
at one point we
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
um approved money here
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
for some employees at hampstead hospital
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
they were going to be non-classified too
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
which was i think the first time i ever
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
heard that was that the only place aside
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the legislature that we were going
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
to have non-classified
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's true but i think there
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
are a couple of onesies and twosies do
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh first-year attorneys at department of
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
justice before they're commissioned are
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
technically non-classified in a
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
different way
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
but by the way the hampstead hospital
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
people i'm pretty sure my understanding
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
of this is right and sherry can raise
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
their hand on the back if i'm wrong is
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
that that's temporarily non-classified
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
while they're in the process of going
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
through jcec approval
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
to create the to do the evaluation for
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
where they should be in the unclassified
 
01:56:15.679 --> 01:56:17.430 align:start position:0%
where they should be in the unclassified
system

01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
but we're getting rid of them anyway
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're what we're
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating those
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
when they turn into because we did
 
01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:29.430 align:start position:0%
when they turn into because we did
something

01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
statutory when yeah when they switch the
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
old thing goes away the thing that's a
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
all right now can i and finally announce
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
