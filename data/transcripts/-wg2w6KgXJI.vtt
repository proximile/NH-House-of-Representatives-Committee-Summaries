thousand dollar Capital plan for fiscal
 
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 align:start position:0%

by the commissioner comes before you for
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
review and approval and if so we would
 
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
then go to the governor and executive
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
Council in a meeting forthcoming if
 
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 align:start position:0%

just give me a USA Today overview please
 
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.410 align:start position:0%
just give me a USA Today overview please
sure

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 align:start position:0%

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
in general this year fiscal 24 will be
 
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
concentrating on uh lift maintenance
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
lift upgrades lift repairs I can detail
 
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
those and we'll be concentrating on snow
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
making improvements on the Hill from a
 
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
snow making perspective
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 550 000 to do three
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
particular projects those are all
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
primary routes and serve primary areas
 
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 align:start position:0%
of terrain that would be air hydrants
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
water hydrants Airlines and water lines
 
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 align:start position:0%

and there's a thirty thousand dollar
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
item there for compressor upgrades which
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
allow us to better stage our air usage
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
and realize that efficiency probably in
 
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
one year on having to manufacture and
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
use less air in the system compressed
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
air is our primary cost with snow making
 
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
on the left side
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%

there's a fifty thousand dollar motor
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
rebuild item there for also The

Cannonball quad
 
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
um there's a twenty five thousand dollar
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
item there for bull wheel bearings for
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Peabody quad that's our main line
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
out of our primary base Lodge and
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%

which was installed in 2011. we want to
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
do a full-blown uh tear down and
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
reassessment of the electromechanicals
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
of that lift okay
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%

testimony just uh two lighthearted
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions number one how did the uh the
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
under eight under 18 championships in
 
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
the Eastern championships that's really
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
cool uh how is how to how we were able
 
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
to pull that off with the Yeah we
 
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
actually uh we had made probably 97 of
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
the amount of snow we were going to in
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
that area we got hit with a bunch of
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
snow in early March we hosted the u18
 
00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
the under 18 national championships uh
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%

Truman yes please again another
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
lighthearted question has um has the
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
bear Den been activated this year yeah
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's funny every time we have a meeting
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
at Peabody Lodge they're literally
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
roaming right through the the front yard
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
so to speak awesome yeah okay thank you
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
um Sandra Lang
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
um just I'm looking through your notes
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
from your last
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
um kind of mountain advisory commission
 
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
meeting and I was looking at your
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
scanned visits versus car counts is this
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
the first year you're doing that so uh
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that this year is
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
probably a more accurate number compared
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
to yes yeah thank you for asking so we
 
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
for 85 years believe it or not we had
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
essentially been on the what was the ski
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire model of every vehicle two
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
and a half people every bus is 50 people
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
every van is uh is 10 people you kind of
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
take a blended average uh where you you
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
balance out against your all tickets
 
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
issued times 1.36 to account for
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
Passover usage you've got an average
 
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
Passover usage you've got an average
um

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
the the scanned access stuff came in at
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
about 10 off of what we had always shown
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
as a typical uh and that's about what we
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated given where Revenue was
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
where natural snow was
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
where where visits were
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
um so yeah but at this point we've got a
 
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
Baseline and we can move forward from
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be the new normal
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
right we'll use this well hopefully the
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
enormous higher right and I would expect
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
I would suspect that it will be you know
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
we lost 15 days last year which is about
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
10 of our season
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh a couple of questions if I
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
could I spoke about your air compressor
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
and higher Efficiency do do we I guess
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be the question do we own most of
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
those or are those least like other
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
operations come in for Winston yeah no
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
we actually we own everything at this
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
point the uh the days of folks Leasing
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
air capacity uh have kind of Gone by the
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
wayside when I was at Attitash we did a
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
lot of that it you're better off owning
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
over the long term for sure okay and my
 
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
my other question I had a meeting with
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner Stewart just a couple days
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
ago uh speaking about uh amateur radio
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
repeaters uh on different sites and uh
 
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:48.740 align:start position:0%
and coming to a better policy for that
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
do either of you gentlemen have any
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
knowledge of I know that there's at
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
least one repeater in Cannon Mountain
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
do you see that that's a incompatibility
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem at your facility no I don't
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
think so we actually operate on three
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
different channels for Canon and
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch State Park and I know
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
that uh the gal who had most recently
 
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
been in the Telecom and radio
 
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.990 align:start position:0%
been in the Telecom and radio
communications

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
communications
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
job at dncr had been dealing with three
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
or four different primary contractors
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
essentially to get them to provide
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
upgrades to our plant in order to have
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
space on that on that plant but that's
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
completely separate from our operation
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
we also host State Police
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS Etc yep no I appreciate that
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a believer that that operation is
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
our last line of defense and if there
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
were issues I wanted to hear about that
 
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
were issues I wanted to hear about that
so

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
um any any further
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
a not and lighthearted question it's a
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate question okay please thank
 
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.329 align:start position:0%
legitimate question okay please thank
you

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
um again thank you for taking the other
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
two questions the um based on reading
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
the reports uh excuse me the minutes
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
that you provided staffing has been a
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
challenge I guess my question is losing
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
the 15-day staffing issues the ski
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
school which I know drives a lot of
 
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
school which I know drives a lot of
traffic

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
um how much has that impacted your
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
overtime budget
 
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.290 align:start position:0%
overtime budget
tremendously

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's what I want yeah we're pretty
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
heavy into
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
OT at this point uh we're working we're
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
crunching a lot of numbers and we're
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to do some stuff with payroll
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
we'll do some stuff with uh with perks
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
and Denny's and you know of course we
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
have a goal to hire more Folks at the
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
class 50 level and therefore cut on
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
overtime for sure and I guess the
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I could miss the job please
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
still still running still running even
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
budget wise credits versus our
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
anticipation is that we'll finish fiscal
 
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.470 align:start position:0%
anticipation is that we'll finish fiscal
23.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
23.

Authority division of ports and harbors
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh in this request we have before you as
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
a result of the
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
storm we had back in December that uh
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
blew out the sea oil down at right Arbor
 
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:19.940 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate that
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have a contractor that does uh snow
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
plowing it's located right up the road
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
and he has all of the equipment and came
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
came down the morning after the storm
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
opened up the roadways so that the uh
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
the boaters the primarily the fishermen
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
that continue to operate during the
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
winter months had access to the docks so
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
they could get out to their boats and
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
then over the next few days they came in
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
and restood the wall again I brought in
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
some additional armor Stone
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
we had worked pretty closely with uh
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management and giving them our
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
estimates on what the costs were going
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
to be because they were putting in the
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
to declare it a disaster and so we were
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
working working through that and then
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
when the presidential the classic
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
disaster notification came out what we
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
were trying to do was get the funds from
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
that but apparently I was told at
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County didn't qualify didn't
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
meet meet the threshold
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
so uh that's why we're here today to
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
request this money be released from that
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
fund so that we can pay the bill
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%
uh did you ever did you have a question
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
represent boy yes I did Mr chairman
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Gina thank you for your
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for the pictures
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
um is there anything else that needs to
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
be done that that's not included in this
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
particular request that should be
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention or is this this
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
is what needs to be fixed well this
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're just paying for what's been fixed
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
I understand that I guess I'm looking
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman um
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing problem down there it's
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
just the Dynamics of the Waterfront uh
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh the year before we had a winter storm
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and it blew up out of the wall down on
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
the on the north end of it uh where
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
route 1A comes across you know we put
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
that back together we beefed it up with
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
some additional armor Stone uh you know
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
that was a 42 45
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
000 fix there uh and it held up during
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
this storm so what what improvements we
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
did there we did those improvements here
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
on this section of the wall now uh it's
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
a dynamic place I mean the facility was
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
built back in 1960 and when they dredged
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
Dry Harbor and they put in the
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
reventment but the whole facility was
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
built on top of the marsh
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it's like it's like building your
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
house on top of a sponge yes that's a
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
good analogy thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.990 align:start position:0%
good analogy thank you Mr chairman thank
you

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%

himself
um

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone for the record my
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
name is Bill Watson I'm the
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Bureau of planning
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
and Community Assistance at the
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you would you just tell us real
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
briefly what the total credits are being
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
used for
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
so under RSA
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
um toll credits are are allowed to be
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
used automatically
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
for prior approval for roadway and
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
Bridge construction reconstruction one
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
of the areas of our federal funding that
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
we receive is in the area of planning
 
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.689 align:start position:0%
we receive is in the area of planning
dollars

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
that are used both by the department by
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions that we
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
contract with through Governor Council
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
UNH and other other groups that we
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
contract with
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
to provide Statewide planning Regional
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
local planning efforts throughout the
 
00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:06.350 align:start position:0%
local planning efforts throughout the
state

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
um the existing statutes do not allow
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
for the automatic use of toll credits so
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
this request is essentially asking for
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
the use of toll credits to match the
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
anticipated Federal funding that we're
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
receiving over the next two years are
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
there questions for the gentleman yes
 
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.689 align:start position:0%
there questions for the gentleman yes
please

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
um being new to the committee could you
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
just explain what toll credits are and
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
how they come about
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
certainly so
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of investment that is made
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
by the state on roadways that are
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
classified as federal aid eligible or
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
not federally eligible some of those
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
dollars estate dollars some of those
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal dollars
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
we have so our Turnpike system I-95 the
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike the FD Everett
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
turnpike through Nashville and up
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
through Manchester are all classified as
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
federally eligible roadways
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
but we do not use federal dollars on
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
those roadways to maintain them we'll
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
use the toll revenues collected at the
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
at the toll booths to to maintain and
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
improve those roadways
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
so there is a calculation process that
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
we go through with Federal Highway
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
Administration on an annual basis to
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
calculate basically a three-year rolling
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
average of how much State investment
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we are making on those Federal
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
eligible roadways
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
when those Investments reach a certain a
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
certain threshold that's acceptable to
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway then we calculate the
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
value of that state dollar that's used
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
in those Federal eligible roadways and
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
those are allowed back to us from
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Administration as toll
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
credits which essentially replace the 20
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
match that's required for most of the
 
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that we use
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a mechanism to allow the
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
department to fully utilize the federal
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the federal funds that we receive
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
through the Federal Highway
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
Administration without the requirement
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
of using a 20 State match
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
I must say after all these years that
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
was a great explanation thank you that
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
could go a long time thank you I
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%

thinking of our you know Lakes Region
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
area and a community action program does
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of this function about helping
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
with mobility and for seniors and and
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
disabled people how does this integrate
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
with that at all or is it completely
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
separate uh effort
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
so this requests if it moves forward one
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
of the positions in in that region the
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
community action program at belnet and
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
Merrimack counties they are the lead
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
agency through which These funds will go
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
to and will be going to governor and
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
Council later this year for a two-year
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
contract so that Agency for the the
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
greater Region Three again the map may
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
be helpful and I should hand that out um
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
we'll actually go to that agency so that
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
again we're building on the efforts that
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
are already out there and just trying to
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
coalesce them and bring them together so
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily create new but Aggregate
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
and bring together and create
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
efficiencies within regions
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh could I just ask that you leave us a
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh I was just a request to get it on the
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
record if Das could when they provide
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets as part of their
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
documentation they could actually
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
provide the underlying spreadsheet it
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
was suggested to me by LBA that the best
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
way to get that on the record was just
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
to request it now since they're not
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
actually here that'd be okay thank you
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
is is there someone here from Des on the
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay we'll uh we'll get more of an
 
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.250 align:start position:0%
okay we'll uh we'll get more of an
explanation

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.169 align:start position:0%
explanation
yes

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
well let's
 
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
well let's
yes

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
the um I I guess
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
I was somewhat confused by the
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that was that was sent well
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean that especially it was
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
confusing what I'm asking for is the
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
actual spreadsheet the electronic
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
document the Excel spreadsheet oh okay I
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
think it's include that when they send
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
out the documentation it's easier for me
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
happy to take that back and uh for
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
clarification uh the spreadsheet I
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
believe that representative is
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
discussing is the one that comes from
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
the status of the capital uh budget
 
00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:53.510 align:start position:0%

all right I mean I believe your
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
intention was probably not to meet
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
through the summer and come back
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
sometime in September that's correct I
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
Summer down there okay so uh with that
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
