00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record uh State
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Monica
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
mapelli so I just um share with you uh
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
what I've been working on um it it is
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
essentially uh a proposal to do a
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
housekeeping housekeeping um this next
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh legislative session to do some clean
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
up of the accounts that we currently
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
hold um I have custody of and others
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
that no are listed in the law but they
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't know they I don't we no longer
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
have those accounts so um so it's an
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to to take to to clean that up
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
um the the other piece is this this
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
those so so those accounts that I'm
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
primarily um referring to and I added
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
pages so uh the other thing I did is I
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted everything so so we don't
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
get lost on what what I ended up um uh
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
adjusting or or or for discussion
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
purposes but um essentially what the
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
work that I'm that I'm that I'm doing is
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
on pages uh uh for uh let's see is 15
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
and um 16 which are the what is called
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the custodial ancra accounts and the
 
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
trust and what they used to be referred
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
as agency funds so uh that's the the the
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
primary goal here to to clean up those
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
accounts those accounts they used to be
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
referred as um again trust and agency
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
funds that terminology changed with a
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
new accounting standard back in
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
2020 um the act for now refers to those
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
agency funds as custodial accounts the
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
war agency was removed from the
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
literature essentially because it was
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
confusing readers uh so they decided to
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate that concept so we do have uh
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
a definition in this
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
section um for an agency fund so that's
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
another thing that um this this proposal
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
considers removing the word agency and
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
the definition instead of um again we
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
will remove could will remove the
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
definition of agency and now we call
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
them custodial accounts which is
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
anything that the state holds that is
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
not State's money
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely behind trying to write and
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
and listen at the same time yes I don't
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
see anything that says custodial funds
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
in here it's just saying per trust
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
permanent and endowment
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
funds that that's correct uh represent
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
612c yeah uh considers
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
trust and I'm suggesting to add the word
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
permanent which is what we we refer to
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
some funds some trust that maintain we
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
maintain the Corpus only and then the
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
word endowment because before it wasn't
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
included so but then the other section
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
is RSS
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
62d those
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
include um oh custodial and escar
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
accounts okay so the work so the work
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
that you'll see once you have an
 
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review is
 
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.750 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review is
essentially

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um first of all what it's trying to do
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
is include all of the accounts that is
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
not general fund include them in the
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
list R say 12 uh 612
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
612b 612 C and 612 D so they're either
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
a a typical dedicated
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
account a trust or a custodial
 
00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
account a trust or a custodial
account

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
um there is a section in
 
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
um there is a section in
[Music]

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
um it's actually I say 612e that talks
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
about if agencies
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
have a new dedicated fund is a trust or
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
custodial account essentially they can
 
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:04.839 align:start position:0%
come to the treasure for a possibility
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
of having a that account separately
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
maintained so we could per perhaps open
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
up and we do for for those trusts and
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
and C accounts we do have separate bank
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
accounts but one of the things that we
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
want to distinguish is what is
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
considered a typical educated fund for
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
example last time we were talking about
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
the can Mountain fund that's just a
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
typical dedicated fund so we wouldn't
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
have a separate bank account for that
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
but we would and we do for the venam and
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
thumbon Trust for example so so I guess
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
what this cleanup does is it puts the
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
trust and C accounts that we currently
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
have and have separate bank accounts
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
under RSA 612 CN but anything else goes
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
back to a typical dedicated account
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
612 could could I ask I can't find 9 612
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
b or
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
a have they just disappeared or no no
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the is here is just it's just um let me
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
locate that the beginning of all the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
numbers so R6
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
oh a a is shall establish and maintain
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
accounts and B is money received by the
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
state treasurer shall be accounted for
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
General except that b includes the
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission remove that actually
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
fines a whole bunch of when does B end
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
is B what we've always thought of as the
 
00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
is B what we've always thought of as the
612s

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
612s
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
it is um what page are you I'm on page
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
one and two I can double check this but
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
it is possible
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
removed all right so
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
so a and
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
the so 612 A and
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
B it it is an oh is Page One
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
in 12b just speaks about monies received
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
by the state treasurer as Pro 6
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
611 shall be accounted for in the state
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
accting system 612
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
Dash yeah it is possible I did not
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
include B in here I don't know um no
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
there is a b right under a on on that
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
one and then we start with all of the
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
right is it's not relevant to the
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
is in that that fund is actually one
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
that we keep we have a separate bank
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
account for that is is the electric
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
assistant program so that that statute
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
pertains to to that deer account it is
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
possible I I missed it so I can redo
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
this but so I'm not there not any
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
changes on that one but it will be part
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the universe essentially that account
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
yeah she just didn't print those two
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's yeah it is possible that I missed
 
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.350 align:start position:0%
that's yeah it is possible that I missed
that

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
um okay but that's really what it is you
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
four so so um the yellow
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
highlights I just for example 71 I just
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
was just highlighting the fact that
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that's the 612b so it's I wanted to
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that in in the list
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
of dedicated
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
accounts it is already consider the fact
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
that six RSI 612b is in your list and
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's another section and I don't want
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
to skip around too much but
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
um on page six so it shows item 167 and
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
6 168 you
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
have the funds persuant or 6612 C and D
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
those are listed under a typical
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
dedicate account so it's just to to
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
highlight that piece but um going back
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
four item
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
7A um I'm REM I'm proposing to remove
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
that because I'm putting it under
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
the trust accounts so right now it's
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
listed Us in the typical lady accounts
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
but I'm moving it to the trust section
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
this 71 or it 78
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
78 okay next highl yeah correct so
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what she's saying is trust
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
funds are different yeah than all these
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
other dedicated funds and therefore
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in their own section
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
not in 612 and that's following the what
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
the current structure I think that's
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's how it was at some point the law
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
was written that way it just got messy
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
over the years because he wasn't kept up
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
so my goal is to make sure that you know
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
going forward once we're able to do this
 
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
going forward once we're able to do this
initial

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping will'll review on a regular
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
basis to ensure that you have the
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
there and so essentially most of these
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
yellow cross out things are trust funds
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
correct so you're going to see them in
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
the section for trust funds got and I
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
only put one back the there's one for
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
the list of dedicated accounts there's
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
only one that we put under the dedic
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund list which
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
is so a couple I guess uh the Water
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
Resources project when you read that law
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
it just looks like a typical dedicated
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
account it doesn't look like there's
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
really anything in particular why I
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
should hold that separate and then the
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
that has its own section but it was
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
never added to the to the list to the
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
universe represent a moment yeah
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
why what does it do to have
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
71 just to start with the beginning of
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
it in as a dedicated fund when
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
what is 12b that it's referring to so
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
12b is that is is the the tutor
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
reference um Jennifer was was uh reading
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
before that is one of the accounts that
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
we hold as the electric um assistance
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
program so it's just listed here in
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
addition to where it was the enabling
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
statute the the the creation of that
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
fund well that that should be a
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund as far as I'm conc but so
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
you should you need the title electric
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
something or other yeah under 71 just
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
like all these others have a name right
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
they don't just say well a fair number
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
of them don't have names and it makes it
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult we could we could add
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the actual the actual law if you if
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
you again I'm sorry it's not here but
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
when you read 612b it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
mention the electric assistance program
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
fund but that's the but that's what it
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
is but we can add we can add it
 
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.029 align:start position:0%
is but we can add we can add it
name

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and a name that allows you to go
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
find the law if you want it correct it
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
took me a while to fund that account
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
actually just because it didn't have a
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
name but that's in essence what this is
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
doing and again it's just cleaning up
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
moving the trust accounts under the
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
trust section and anything that is looks
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
like and sounds like an escrow or a
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
custodial is move is is moving that to
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
the custodial account and what this will
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
allow us to do is it's also a guide not
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
only for for the committee and
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislators but also for agencies
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they want they come
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
and say well we would like a separate
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
bank account so this will really um kind
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
of provide that criteria like if it's
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
not if this account is not under a trust
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
or a Custer account then I really need a
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
good reason why I will need to open a
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
separate bank account for that question
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
represent W is a trust fund funded other
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
than out of the general fund like have
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
separate income whereas most of the
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
other ones that are dedicated funds are
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
coming out of general fund generally
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe Highway fund or some other
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
fund but that that's in Ence what it is
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
so trust funds were either created is
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
not stay they're not State funds they're
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
just perhaps initially some of them were
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
funded with a particular some's name is
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
on them somebody gave us a $100,000 or a
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars correct and so that so
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
that typically we keep
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
again dependent on what it is but Mo
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
most of the time we keep those in a
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
separate investment account and those
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
grow differently and it's just we don't
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
add money to them in the general fund it
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
just Grows Right for the most part yes
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's some that allow gifts and
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
donations by other entities and when
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
that happens we need to keep an eye on
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
those because all of a sudden it's not
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
public money I mean it's it's just a
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
different type of account that we need
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on is there a
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
significance between difference between
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
the word endowment and trust or
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
not um no but we have all kinds of
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
flavors so I just wanted to make sure
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we were including both I mean the
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
endowments typically the there there may
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
be some trust that there if if we some
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
if some funds were umed to the state
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
then perhaps the entire amount can be
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
spent but most of the times the
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
endowments you you you need to keep the
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
initial amount
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
permanently and and just use the income
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
so that sometimes comes into play when
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
it comes to an endowment
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
fund let me ask turn to page
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
on yes so these three Connecticut Lakes
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
funds are ones we've been talking about
 
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.750 align:start position:0%
funds are ones we've been talking about
this

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
year um why are you moving them because
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're endowments because they're
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're end right and we already have
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
separate investment accounts for those
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
so they're they're fall under the type
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
of accounts that we are maintaining
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
separately is the act of moving These
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
funds to the other list going to take
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
them away from the perview of this
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee no no no unless they have un
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
accept sounds like I was speaking with
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh um with the controller and it sounds
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
like there's some exceptions um when it
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
comes to reporting un as you add them to
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
the list of exceptions and know then all
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
of these accounts should be reported to
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
you for the most part all of these
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
accounts the endowments and the trust
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
those are on the those are we have
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
custody of them so we will come and
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
report to you on a regular
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
basis represent M yeah well first the
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
ones that we decided to remove are ones
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
that are reported directly every year to
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
some agency and the public get to see
 
00:21:59.159 --> 00:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
some agency and the public get to see
the

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
reports and and they objected to having
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
to do two different kinds of reporting I
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
see but second what I wasn't caught up
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
with what you were doing when you
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
started uh 167 and 168 what's the
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of having these
 
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.750 align:start position:0%
purpose of having these
in

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.070 align:start position:0%
in
612

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
612
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
B so
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
1B or whatever it is right so 167 168
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
um those references have been there the
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
entire time it just sounded like the the
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation want wanted
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
everything listed under RSA
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
612 uh whether that's needed that's up
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
to this committee and and legislator
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
seems me that it's needed but not there
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
in this list of all the dedicated funds
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
that it ought to be up near the top
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere as part of the
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
system and it could be maybe that's how
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
all of the accounts were initially
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
um that's a good point those could be
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
removed well I I think it's probably a
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
good idea to have them there so that
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
that shows that we have some kind of say
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
over it I think but but putting them up
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
at the beginning before the list starts
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're all the things in C and all the
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
things in D yeah okay we're never going
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
to be able to get rid of the repeals are
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
we you probably never want to reuse the
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
number yeah yeah well we got rid of a
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of stuff when we started
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
this system it was an alphabetical
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
system they were down to things like
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
13 that the next
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
is so these are the two most
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
recent Water Resources project well I I
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
added those so so the Water Resources
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
was listed under the trust and it's not
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
a trust the drinking water groundwater
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund I'm not sure you're being
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
reported on that because it wasn't in
 
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.230 align:start position:0%
reported on that because it wasn't in
the

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
list it was it is again yeah it is an
 
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.350 align:start position:0%
list it was it is again yeah it is an
RSA

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
6D one but it wasn't anywhere in the
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
section of the law so I'm not sure
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're being reported on that so why
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
isn't that in the groups of trust
 
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
isn't that in the groups of trust
f

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
f
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
um that's a great
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
question um so the group of trust funds
 
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
question um so the group of trust funds
that

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
we have and or that amadden to the RSA
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
612 D and
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess what I would say is
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
according to uh financial reporting
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
purposes the controller has always kept
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
that fund under the general
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
fund I do not fully understand the
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
specifics but that that's how it's seen
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh we do maintain a separate Bank
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
separate investment account for that one
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
is it in my opinion we we could put it
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
under the list of trust funds if you if
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
you want it um but that's the only
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason because it's not considered a
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
feary fund according to um this one
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
fund my SE it with that account is it it
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
provides loans it it is
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
um it is similar to the Clean Water
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
groundwater um fund it provides loans to
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities so they use it um it's
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
another source of funds is but it's
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
similar is used in a similar way as um
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's a revolving fund as a revolving
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
fund correct yeah and so I think it's
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
and probably originally done by the
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
legislature right correct cuz that was
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
that was a settlement money and then
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
that fund was created and now it's being
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
used sort of like as part of regular
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
business instead of trust would be a
 
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.630 align:start position:0%
business instead of trust would be a
better

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
typ okay whener when we work on the fish
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
and game budget my recollection is they
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
have as many as 13 dedicated funds they
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
have uh sub dedicated oh some for bait
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
some for
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh they coaching some for something else
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
and so are those part of these funds so
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
those likely are listed in the first
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
section where all of the the loan
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
list uh we don't have separate accounts
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
for those those are definitely they
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
should be part of game department the
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
loan list of funds so they would would
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
they be under fishing game rather than
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
we probably under the dedicated funds
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
because they have control of them and
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
they use them at various times right my
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
my what I will
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
my guess is that they're going to be
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the list one through 300
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
one through what is the last one so
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
here's fishing game in the book right so
 
00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.750 align:start position:0%
here's fishing game in the book right so
they're

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
they're
396

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
um page 258 and so
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
on they are somewhere between 1 and 396
 
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.029 align:start position:0%
on they are somewhere between 1 and 396
or

00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
394 well two of those number two and
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
number three in in 612b one
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
b 2 58 we
 
00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:13.029 align:start position:0%
b 2 58 we
found

00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
right they must be the the
 
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.149 align:start position:0%
right they must be the the
oldest

00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
oldest
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
yeah well no no
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
they that when they did a
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
numeric they I don't know I don't know
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
how they change the order yeah fines and
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
damages license plate fund Statewide
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
Public boat access search and rescue so
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're all in
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
there so they're all there that search
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
and rescue I'm delighted that was a
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
10year project to create that Pike
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
safety card all sorts of resistance and
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
now it brings in 300,000 a year when
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
they used to come and ask us for 100,000
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
every year because Senator Ros search
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
and rescue was behind
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
on page um
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
12 number
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
360 the opioid abatement trust fund I'm
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if that should be moved to the
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
trust fund section because those are
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
funds that we really can't spend in any
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
other way except how this Department of
 
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.669 align:start position:0%
other way except how this Department of
Justice

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
so the way even though so the way this
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
fund has been treated it has been
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
treated as a typical dedicated
 
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.509 align:start position:0%
treated as a typical dedicated
fund

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
um it it really is a legislative
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
decision if
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a separate investment
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
account do we have a
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
separate I don't think we couldn't in
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
house bill to would say we're going to
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
take all the money out of the H be right
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
to Pap and trust
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
fund which we could do in some of these
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
other funds if we did that with this we
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
would violate the terms of the
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
settlement and we would lose all that
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
money so I'm just wondering if it should
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that that would be move under the
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
trust it is it is so so I think it is is
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
it will be fine I think some of the some
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
of the difficult sometimes it's
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to really understand the the
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
legislative intent um because we see
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
trust created all the time so then as we
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
have to figure it out is it really a
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
trust do they really intend to maintain
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
it as a trust and a lot of times when
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
you read the language it sounds and
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
feels like a typical fund so but but
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
based on what you're saying I think if
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's moved to the trust section it is
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
probably a it is a better it will be a
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
better understanding of all of us at
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
trying to figure things out
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
you know the type of account that that
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
the um the intent of legislature will
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
create in that account or that in this
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
case the trust so I think it will be
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
fine thank you you're
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
welcome so I could could provide that
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
change if you we like that I just
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
scanned down this one page and there is
 
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.990 align:start position:0%
scanned down this one page and there is
a

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
fmli premium stabilization trust fund in
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
375 Maybe maybe we
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
could could get this list of trust funds
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
in front of the com controler also and
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
get her to weigh in on this yeah that is
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
funny and she and and uh um she's I
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
shared my list with her she's reviewing
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
it she U she just couldn't provide me
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
with comments but she she will Pro
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
probably have some comments trust and
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
you will see a lot of trust then and but
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
we don't consider those trust yeah but
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
but but again that's been difficult for
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
all of us who are trying to take care of
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
those funds whether it is really a trust
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
or it was just the war trust used while
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
creating those funds would we have the
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
power to change the name of the ones
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
confusion and then move the trust the
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
first we'd have to Define what a trust
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
fund is so what what definition would
 
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
you definition is here already it was it
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
there um that is on page
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
14 that's the letter G oh no that's
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:49.029 align:start position:0%
 
F

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
F
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
14 yeah page 14 letter F letter F you
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
have that definition there trust fund
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really address the issue um
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
of the opioid opioid trust fund which
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
had well had a lot of deceased people
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
but they weren't
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
involved so a lot of times says usually
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it does say usually so a lot of
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
times when
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
um so TR SEC Creator in
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
law but but there is no trust document
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
created so for example um I'm
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
gonna the
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
um nuclear the commissioning fund that
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
has a trust there is a trust document
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
associated with the fund so that's an
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
easy one that's a trust but a lot of
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
times this this the the the L here
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a document that goes with
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
there or any type
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
of of is so that's why doesn't it some
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just a name and not an
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
actual trust especially the way the law
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
is written and the way those funds are
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
used so um it would be great if we if if
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
if the legislature creates trust um
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
creating a trust document to go with it
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
could be sort of like a secondary fece
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
that way in the future um there is no
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
desire to change legislation all of a
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
trust yeah so thank you for that page it
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
it obviously identifies both the trust
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
trustee and the
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
custodian so yeah trustee is needs a
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
trustee a trust account needs a trustee
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
correct and it's going to be someone
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
likely outside the government whereas
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
the custodial accounts likely going to
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
be the government probably you correct
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm actually Trustee of some
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
accounts um like the for example the
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
fight plan I'm the trustee of that
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's a trust document associated with
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
that it's not here because we don't it's
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's people's money but but that's one
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
example of a document and I'm the
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
trustee of of of that program so can you
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
and the comproller get together and
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
review everything that has the name
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
trust and and uh make a recommendation
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
if they're not really trust and then we
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
can come up with new names for
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
them okay I think she will because but
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh from financial report and
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
purposes U she will probably suggest to
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
remove the war trust from so many of
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
these funds but again it will be up to
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature to Define what it is
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
that you really if any of those funds
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
are are really trust according to the
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislative intent like the I guess what
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is yes for you to anything
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
that has the word trust in its title but
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
does not meet the definition in
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
F right to highlight that for us okay
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then we can take the action of
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
removing the word
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
trust okay absolutely trust should also
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
announce who is the
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
trustee and what if the trustee
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
dies and should well the state would be
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
the trusty right no no in many of them
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
it names a person trust usually could
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
name a person or it should be The Heirs
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
of and so whoever goes next in line if
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
someone dies but if if if it's a trusted
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
and so usually she's the um she has the
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh administrator administrator of many
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
of these but may not be the TR the
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
trustee if it I am the truste and many
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the law states law shall be the
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
treasur of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
that pretty obvious and we don't have to
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
worry about any successors yeah but if
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's the trust names a person they
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
should be within the the
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
text or or The Heirs of so it's it's
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
pretty clear because the trustee has the
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility to invest the
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
funds not putting it all on her so you
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
know and that's why she's there I know
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
but if if they if they don't name her as
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the trustee specifically yeah if someone
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
names their family to be the and wants
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
to keep their name on it forever but
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
then why would we have the money
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
yeah because it's it's for some
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
government purpose oh I see well so I'm
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
leaving I'm leaving my keep the person's
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
name on it I see what you're saying the
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
one I read recently in a fiscal item
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
that somebody left uh a shoreline 12
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
acres was it the U Glen's something
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
Glen's Glen Cove Glen Cove and uh so it
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
was a life estate until he died of
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
course nobody maintained it while he was
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
elderly and and still using it so now
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're spending a lot of money to get a
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
a consultant to decide which buildings
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
need to be torn down which ones need to
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
be fixed and how much it's going to cost
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
this is going to take a couple of years
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
before it finally becomes part of the
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
state park so in that instance obviously
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
he didn't leave a family as trust gave
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
it to fishing game with a life estate so
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
every every one of these has a little
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
bit trickier different way it's left
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
some will be left her as the trustee
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
some will be left with family as
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
trustees some will be left as life of
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
State all these different
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
mechanisms I remember
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair yes representative Jan
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um just a general question um
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
where do these definitions come from is
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
this in the rsas or yes this is this is
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
ex law um okay again the only the only
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
that's why I highlight everything else
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
to find it but everything else is exist
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
is is is the current law because I guess
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
when I read trust and it says means in
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
that first line usually with a formal
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
written agreement contractor will of
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
deceased person and I just I think about
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of trusts out there where
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
the trustee is a living person and
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
created it so I'm I guess I'm not sure
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
why it's deceased I mean it could be
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
deceased or non deceased right you're
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
misreading it so okay formal written
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
agreement comma contract comma or will
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
of a deceased person oh you see what I
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
good point okay yeah that works all
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
right now it makes
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
sense all right all right so do you you
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
have something to do we El set any
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
questions about thank you very much for
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
concerning this um so I will work with
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
um uh controller call to to identify the
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
trust I'll highlight it for you and I
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
can come back next time you meet I'm
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
guessing we're generally in favor of
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
making these changes yes I would follow
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
her recommendations and would file a
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill if we I don't want to go beyond the
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
filing period without at least filing it
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
by name then maybe having to amend it
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
January of February whenever he up so
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is a
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
more I I wouldn't want to necessarily
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
bury this in our other committee bill
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
right yeah make a separate bill out of
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
this yeah yeah so it's clear and I'm not
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
sure what commed it would go before
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
probably Edna yeah right but
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
um I had one more question some of these
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
anything no no everything the name from
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
one place to another no we're not
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
repealing anything and bringing more
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
government money back into the
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
government that would be my point from
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
all of this exercise do we recover any
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
money from dedicated funds to General
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
funds no okay but but but actually I
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify the the only ones
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
are being
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
repealed are because we no longer have
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
those funds there's zero funds in them
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
so we don't gain anything when correct
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
no no you don't have extra money
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but uh um there some of
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
the ones that I'm repealing like for
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
example there's one called the
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
disolution of cor Corporation account of
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer that doesn't exist
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
um uh there was another
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
one the racing and charal gaming escra
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
account that doesn't
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
exist yeah so we're we're repealing
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
those totally under under this proposal
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
just because they don't
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
and there's another the Caroline a fox
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
fund that doesn't exist um the
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
department gets income from the actual
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
trust but there is no such thing as the
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have the trust
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves it's in Department of Ed that
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
is um that is the Caroline a fox fund
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
that is part of the Department of
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
cultural and um natural
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
resources not managed through your
 
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.710 align:start position:0%
resources not managed through your
office

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
yes inde no I think what what was
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
happening and I was asking about this
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
particular account we used to receive
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
the income from the trust and I believe
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
that is um somewhere in Massachusetts we
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
get the income and we were depositing
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
that that those amounts into a separate
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
investment account but the beneficiary
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
is the department so now the money is
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
being sent directly to the department it
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to our office there's
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
really no need to for us to be
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
intermediaries so they receive the money
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
and they use it for um you have you have
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
to keep it on your books is is um so not
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
not separate books it's just part of the
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh Department's books the money that
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
they get to fund that program still
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
fiduciary yeah represent M yeah I was
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
just this the state of Massachusetts
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
fine with
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
that because it's a Massachusetts
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
organization which is say ending the
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
money for the maintenance of this
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
forestry group I believe so I mean I I
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
have not even seen that document I can't
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
I can do additional research on this but
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we no longer have
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
anything at the
 
00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:12.910 align:start position:0%
anything at the
treasury

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
um it's just going straight to them it's
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
the the the income the it's going
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
straight to the finish uh the
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiary which is the department but
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
I can ask I about that our departments
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
to to be
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
accepting well yeah donations yeah they
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
do from everywhere they ask ask the
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to approve you know
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
when somebody wants to give money the
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee can approve it yeah
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay could could I often there's strings
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
attached right so yeah anyways yes
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
represent there was this drinking water
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
ground drinking water groundwater trust
 
00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
fund on page p which is on page 13 that
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
we sort of started discussing but I
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
think we turned off onto something else
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
this is one apparently should have been
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
in 612 and they discovered it that it
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't correct it's just being added to
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
the to the list to the
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
universe didn't put it in 612 for some
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
but this brings back your question about
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
whether we should have a trust if this
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
should be a trust or not so yeah right
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's a trust f question I'll I'll
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
that thanks thanks very much for your
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
time no thank you very much bu okay oh
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah always represent so what what kind
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
of opportunity do we have to meet again
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
about this or do we do it all as
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
IOP I was hoping that this would be our
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
penultimate meeting
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
oh okay is that I was thinking of it as
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
the ultimate as the ultimate meeting
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay no penultimate got it second to
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
last yeah yeah the last one was the
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
too um because we still
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
have well we still have the the um final
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
report I mean if you think we can do
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
enough to you know charge me with
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
writing it or making changes to it or
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
whatever I think we probably should have
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
another meeting but okay all right maybe
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
one more next we come in thinking that
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay well next week isn't time enough
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
for them to do their work
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
oh well there's not too many weeks left
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah remember that committee amendments
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
or committee
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
bills uh usually go to rules and rules
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
just passes them on through
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
so that's you know there's not a not a
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
worry later you know so and we're going
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to have a five
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
we you are I think so
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
election well I mean if you want the
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
last meeting could be the 30th for
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
example that's two
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
weeks from to
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
anyway all right so let's just remember
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
the further that you get into this month
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
the harder it is uh for people who are
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
running for election re-election to
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
commit because things will come up very
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
quickly and will preempt you yeah okay
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
you mean you some of you have opponents
 
00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
you mean you some of you have opponents
is

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:53.690 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.630 align:start position:0%
is
[Laughter]

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
that okay okay not much of one but
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
oh all right so now we want to look at
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
the the um the report okay and uh we
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
have three documents to kind of to kind
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
