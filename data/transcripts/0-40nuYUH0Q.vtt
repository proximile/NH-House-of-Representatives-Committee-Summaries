00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh for what reason does the I just
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure what I heard there about
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether it was uh ought to pass or itl
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
on that particular uh representative
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
stavis has introduced an amendment to
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay is there any discussion
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
you may
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the language in the amendment
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
um kind of cleans up the original
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
language it adds in the uh the
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
recognition that not all communities
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
have daily newspapers anymore and so
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
alternative means of noticing meetings
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
may be used such as websites Electronic
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
media and the like and it comports more
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
fully with other state law
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
uh concerning public noticing of
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Gallagher
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just wondering about the
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
wording here where it says
 
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.370 align:start position:0%
wording here where it says
um

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
in some Daily newspaper as well as the
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
County website
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I was
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
so if the intent
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
is to provide an alternative
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
for places that don't have a daily
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
newspaper with a wide circulation
 
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.930 align:start position:0%
newspaper with a wide circulation
then

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
does this really help for that because
 
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
it still says both it would still
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
require them to do
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
both since it's as well as rather than
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
or so
 
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just wondering if you could
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
expand on that
 
00:11:53.399 --> 00:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
expand on that
foreign

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher is is correct I
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
do not believe though that the wording
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
precludes a town from
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
from not noticing properly noticing a
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
public meeting
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
if it has a paper or website I think
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
that the amendment is clearly worded as
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
is and can stand on its own and towns
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
can use whatever whatever media is at
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
their disposal thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative stavis I as I read
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
this I kind of agree with representative
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
Gallagher that it says
 
00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
Gallagher that it says
um

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
in some Daily Newspaper having a wide
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
circulation in the county as well as the
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
County website comma if one exists so to
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
me that implies
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
that do it in the newspaper and if you
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
have a website do it there
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
but in Gallagher's illustration
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a newspaper which is
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more prevalent
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
can you just do it in the website
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
and if that's the intent I'm not sure
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
does the trick
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm
 
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.610 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm
sorry

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
pertaining to this amendment here
 
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
is confusion
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the way that it has been drafted with
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
regards to the grammar
 
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.050 align:start position:0%
regards to the grammar
and

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
um therefore
 
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.370 align:start position:0%
um therefore
I

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:18.139 align:start position:0%
I don't recommend
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment as written
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
because it's just going to add confusion
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting against this
 
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting against this
amendment

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.650 align:start position:0%
amendment
John

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
um so to be clear I didn't really mean
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
to bring that up and ask a point against
 
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
the amendment I was more just wondering
 
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.180 align:start position:0%
for a clarification
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we could do an
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment or is it too
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
late for that at this point it's too too
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
late for that right now do we have a
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
representation 11. thank you once again
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not confused by the language the
 
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
the grammar it might be a little choppy
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
um but as an adult I can read that it
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.629 align:start position:0%
um but as an adult I can read that it
says

00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be advertised seven days before
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
in a newspaper as well as a County
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
website if one exists if the town
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a newspaper available to
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
them that will fit the bill
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
and they do have a website for the
 
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
county then it'll go up on the website
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
now some counties have a newspaper
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
that is published that covers a couple
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
different counties and some as
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative lucelles alluded to and
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher may not have a
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
paper in wide circulation but I don't
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
think this prohibits anyone from
 
00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.970 align:start position:0%
think this prohibits anyone from
publishing

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
publishing
 
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.069 align:start position:0%
publishing
publicizing

00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
publicizing
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
noticing where they can to the general
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.650 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
amendment

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
have the clerk call the roll on the
 
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
have the clerk call the roll on the
amendment

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%

2023-0071h

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.169 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%

yes Mr chair I'd like to second that
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%

00:25:05.159 --> 00:25:06.169 align:start position:0%
speak to your Amendment yes thank you
um

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
I believe and uh that that there should
 
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:12.980 align:start position:0%
not be uh
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
any Deputy that is not able to
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
completely fill in the role of the Town
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
Clerk and so I do
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
think that there should not be a deputy
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
that is not domiciled in the town
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I do agree that there is some
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
confusion in the language in 669 65 that
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
ex it talks about a situation where
 
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
there is a deputy that is not allowed or
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
that is not living in uh the town and so
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment seeks to clarify the
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
language in both
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh 41 18 and 6 69 65 that there is uh no
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
situation that a deputy should
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
um not be the be domiciled in the town
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh in uh 41-18
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
there is a reference to an elected Town
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
Clerk and since the um there is the
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that if the elected town
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
clerk steps down the the deputy
 
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:30.260 align:start position:0%
automatically becomes the uh Town Clerk
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh that person wouldn't be elected
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
so uh We've struck that language as far
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
as elected and um
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
and also opened up the language as far
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
as the reasons why they weren't able to
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
provide their uh perform their duties it
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
right now it just said sickness
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
resignation or otherwise subject to this
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
RSA and so we're just changing that to
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
just sickness resignation or otherwise
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
not able to perform their duties
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
essentially then the the deputy town
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
clerk would automatically step in
 
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.750 align:start position:0%
clerk would automatically step in
um

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
and so yeah I'm happy to answer any
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative your Keller
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative power uh representative
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
power uh just one point uh for everybody
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
last night I sent out an amendment to
 
00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:25.130 align:start position:0%
last night I sent out an amendment to
this

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
and it was uh
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
number uh 66 66 and I made a comment in
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the that one uh
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
word elected on line seven they hadn't
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
Struck it through so this is the exact
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
same amendment I sent last night only
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
with the word elected struck through uh
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I just would
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
like to expound on the the um change
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
under section two
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the Striking of that word appointed
 
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
um the Striking of that word appointed
and

00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
clearly as we heard during the hearing
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I pointed out that it is the
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
Selectmen that do the approving
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
and it is the town clerk
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
that does the appointing so that's
 
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:17.390 align:start position:0%
that does the appointing so that's
further

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
um clarification as to why that was
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:28.370 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
representative

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh so in
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
in a case where we did have the
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about interim the deputy
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
taking on the interim if there is an
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
immediate need
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
so where is that if the deputy is not a
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
local resident
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
and is functioning as a deputy but it's
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
only an interim clerk because of the
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
unforeseen is there any scope for that
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not able to
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
would you like to answer that
 
00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative Keller sure
 
00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:10.010 align:start position:0%
representative Keller sure
um

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
um there is no uh
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh nothing in the language that talks
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
about interim
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
um Deputy clerk the the process in 669
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
65 is that if you have a town clerk or a
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
deputy Town Clerk and the town clerk is
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
unable to fill their duties they
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
automatically become the full town clerk
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's not an interim town clerk they just
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
become the full town clerk
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
and so that is going to be the process
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
going forward and there is no situation
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
in that ex that a deputy is not uh
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
domiciled in the town so they are
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
completely qualified to step into the
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
full town clerk role
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
and representative yokella's explanation
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
is exactly correct if you um on line 13
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
it just it does specify that the deputy
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
would serve as the town clerk until the
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
next annual Town election under the old
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
language which is the remainder of that
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
paragraph is what we struck that
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
eliminates the
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
the ability of somebody who does not
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
live in the the town or the district to
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
perform that position so his explanation
 
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.140 align:start position:0%
is exactly correct I I will say that uh
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative power and I spent quite a
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
bit of time ensuring that these two
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
sections did not conflict we and that's
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
why you got that uh Amendment last night
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
because we were still working on it just
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
up until yesterday so
 
00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:44.570 align:start position:0%
up until yesterday so
um

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:47.810 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
representative

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
between the two between the
 
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.769 align:start position:0%
between the two between the
uh

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
top paragraph and then the town clerk
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
paragraph where the
 
00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:08.889 align:start position:0%
paragraph where the
um

00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:08.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
Stockman get to a point
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
the deputy town clerk
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
into the clerk's position
 
00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:20.990 align:start position:0%
into the clerk's position
but

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
if that person
 
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
if that person
isn't

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:28.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
domiciled in the town it doesn't comply
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
with the state's Constitution
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
which states that all Town clerks will
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
be elected and members of the
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
Community from which they serve
 
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
Community from which they serve
um

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:55.580 align:start position:0%
I think it should well it needs to be
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
rewarded or reworked somehow and I I
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
think someone could uh
 
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
challenge it
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.909 align:start position:0%
with the
um

00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
by the appointment of the Town Clerk of
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
someone from out of town and I also
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
question how that would affect
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
our elections if we didn't have a
 
00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:19.190 align:start position:0%
our elections if we didn't have a
properly

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.149 align:start position:0%
properly
appointed

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
debt uh town clerk to replace the one
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
that left
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh because because they didn't uh
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
comply with the Constitution
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's by understanding that the
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
I haven't talked to him personally but
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with this
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
so I think it needs more
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
more time or more scrutiny I'm not
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad concept I think is
 
00:32:57.299 --> 00:32:58.549 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad concept I think is
good

00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make sure that we
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
have we don't have a constitutional
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any other further
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Gallagher
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so I realize this isn't strictly
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
necessary but just wondering for
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
informational purposes if you consulted
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor on the amendment
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
I don't believe representative your
 
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.630 align:start position:0%
I don't believe representative your
color

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
color
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
consulted with the prime sponsor
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay thanks sure any other further
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
discussion representative lasalles
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor of this the intent
 
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:51.380 align:start position:0%
of of this initially was to open up
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
particularly in places where where
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
um the available
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
a reservoir of employees is rather thin
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
they could go outside the town to get a
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
deputy but I think the representative
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
made a compelling argument that the
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
deputy had to be qualified there was no
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
question it's up to the Selectmen to
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
find a deputy that is qualified to step
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
in so I think the the bill the as
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.109 align:start position:0%
in so I think the the bill the as
amended

00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't do what the what the prime
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor said but it does clean up the
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
language and uh is uh worthy of of uh a
 
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.829 align:start position:0%
language and uh is uh worthy of of uh a
vote

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gilman
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I just had one observation that I
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
missed in the original bill
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
um because it says
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
if the town clerk is
 
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
if the town clerk is
um

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
unavailable because of sickness
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
but the solution is to have a deputy
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
until the next election
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
is the town clerk going to stay out for
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
nine months because they're sick for a
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
month until the next election
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
and that's my my observation wasn't
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
solved in the amendment and
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
from the original bill it was still the
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
same question
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none what Representatives Davis
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:44.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
while the
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
argue argument over wording about the
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
position of Deputy town clerk may seem a
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
trivial I wonder if it might
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
um be a tip of the iceberg
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
to a larger problem which is what
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative lasellis referred to as
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
the dwindling reservoir of people
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
available to towns especially small
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
towns to find Qualified
 
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:16.940 align:start position:0%
folks to serve in these vital roles
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
in ways that comport with the State
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the laws and I'm
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
wondering if it may it might not be
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
worth either retaining this bill or
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
further studying it to
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
um to open it up to a to some larger
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
questions that I think it might be
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
so further comment
 
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.950 align:start position:0%
so further comment
representative

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I am trying to do a search through
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
the um through the state's Constitution
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the town clerk be
 
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the town clerk be
elected

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
and I'm not finding that language in the
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
state's Constitution so I do I do
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
understand that it's required in statute
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
that um they will be you know meet the
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
qualifications and one of the
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications are that they'd be in the
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
town but I don't see any
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
anything in the um the state's
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says that it be
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
elected so I'm not sure that that
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
um would raise any
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
um if if someone filled in
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and what you know for a time in
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
between elections I'm not sure that that
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
is actually unconstitutional and it's
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
definitely the practice currently and
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
um an issue so I don't believe that that
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
should be a reason to vote against this
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for some
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I think the there
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
should be some discussion
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office and
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard of this discussion
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
um seeing how
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
he's the one that oversees
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
the elections
 
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.370 align:start position:0%
the elections
um

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
and I I still think there's a a question
 
00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:19.130 align:start position:0%
and I I still think there's a a question
whether

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
whether
um

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
they pointed Deputy town clerk that
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
lives out of town
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be a legal legal substitution so
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I brought
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
up the Secretary of State's office
 
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.930 align:start position:0%
up the Secretary of State's office
because

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
he's obviously
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh more familiar with this than
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
any of us I think
 
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.150 align:start position:0%
any of us I think
um

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right I believe we did that
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative this bill does exactly
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
what I believe you're looking for
 
00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:56.349 align:start position:0%
what I believe you're looking for
um

00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard you saying was
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
that we should not be allowing somebody
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
from out of who's not a resident of the
 
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.990 align:start position:0%
from out of who's not a resident of the
town

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
it would be unconstitutional and that's
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment fixes right the
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
original bill you were correct the
 
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:21.740 align:start position:0%
amendment fixes exactly that
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative power did you have a
 
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.569 align:start position:0%
representative power did you have a
comment

00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair just
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify in my head
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you're absolutely right Mr chair
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
about clarifying
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
but still it there is a statue where
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
interim if there is no election there
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
are Deputy who is not a resident
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
who's serving as a deputy can still
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh in a current practice they can act as
 
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.310 align:start position:0%
uh in a current practice they can act as
the

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.150 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.410 align:start position:0%
um
Clerk

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
and what if there is a special election
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
it's not the regular election cycle so
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
does that give them the leeway to do it
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess that was one of the Prime
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
sponsors issue was if the deputy Enfield
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
especially has that issue so I don't
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
know if he answered the prime sponsors
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
intent for this bill but
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's a question still in my mind
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
represent power
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would like to um
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
um during the hearing in fact the deputy
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state Hennessy did
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
provide testimony before this committee
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
and her testimony in her testimony she
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill as written therefore
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
based on that testimony we can conclude
 
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
based on that testimony we can conclude
that

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office would be
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
in support of this amendment
 
00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:09.710 align:start position:0%
in support of this amendment
um

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
she made it clear that it was absolutely
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
imperative that the clerk
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
the town clerk should be a resident of
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
the town in order to
 
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
the town in order to
properly

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
perform the duties of the Town Clerk and
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
she cited a number of reasons why
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
privacy running the Municipal elections
 
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.030 align:start position:0%
privacy running the Municipal elections
Etc

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
again I'd like to say we did get input
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
I I would like to agree with
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
representative power that we did get
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
input from the Secretary of State's
 
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.410 align:start position:0%
input from the Secretary of State's
office

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
but I see that input a little bit
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
differently I I remember her as talking
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of appointing
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
assistant Town Clerks who could take up
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
some of the responsibilities of the town
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the Deputy town clerk if the deputy
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
town clerk was not available however and
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
and she and she termed that as a
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
workaround but when some members of this
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee asked if that person could in
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
fact run elections her answer was no
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
and and some of us said well then it's
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
not really a workaround which she agreed
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
to so I
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stick to my guns and say
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
that we need further input and
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
information on this bill
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
and on this matter thank you
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none would the clerk call the
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
roll on the Mr chair Amendment I'm sorry
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%

00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
to this bill or we need to vote on the

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes we have to dispose of the current

we have a motion of

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher uh I would like
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to retain the bill in
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee so that we can work out uh
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
further issues with it that we still
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
is there a second

representative for 11 seconds
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher would you like

to speak to your motion
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah um I think
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I like the underlying idea of
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
um and you it's just with some of these
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that remain
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
um unclear what exactly the answer to
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
them is I think we need to get some
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
further input um
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
so personally
 
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.670 align:start position:0%
so personally
um

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
knowing that in New Hampshire
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh we can ask the Supreme Court our
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
state supreme court for advisory
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
opinions I would like to see if it would
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
be possible
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
to do that about the constitutionality
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
of this bill since representative Tatro
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
has raised concerns about that and
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully if that can be done that can
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
help us make a more informed decision as
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
to how to handle this bill once
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
further comments uh
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
what what is that the actual motion on
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
the floor at this time I heard
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
the current motion on the floor is to
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
retain the building committee which
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
would mean it would be taken up next
 
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.150 align:start position:0%
would mean it would be taken up next
year

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.370 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
was there a second on that motion
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative LaSalle
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak in favor of re of
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
the retention motion
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
because the original intent of the Prime
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor was to open up that Reservoir
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
and we I think we all agree that based
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
upon the testimony of the secretary of
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
state that you really can't have anybody
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
who isn't qualified to be a current law
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
says that you you have to be a resident
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
of the Town well that doesn't meet the
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the Prime sponsor so maybe
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
we can resolve this somehow where we can
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
increase that Reservoir without
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
violating the current status of the law
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
so I would be in favor of that
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none well clear call the roll
 
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none well clear call the roll
please

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%

you're going to open up the executive
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
session now on HB 75 increasing the
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
threshold of County old personal
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%

HB Bill HB 75 simply changes the dollar
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
value allowed to be controlled by the
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
commit County Commissioners this
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
original RSA was passed on April 12th of
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
1959 So based on the inflation over the
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
last 64 years I believe this is a
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable increase in the dollar
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
amounts for the Commissioners to control
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown Is there
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%

chair again I heard from the county
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
folks this would enable their
 
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:34.460 align:start position:0%
functioning day-to-day functioning and
 
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:37.220 align:start position:0%
they support it
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
just wanted to relay that thank you
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I support this uh
 
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.210 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I support this uh
as

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
just in the short term but I think in
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
the longer term I remember during one of
 
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.569 align:start position:0%
the longer term I remember during one of
the

00:55:58.569 --> 00:55:58.579 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
discussions on one of the pre the other
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
bills during the hearing representative
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
lasalles raised the point of why are we
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
hard coding these dollar amounts instead
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
of having them indexed to inflation if
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
inflation is the concern that's the
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
reason for raising them now so um yeah
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support this for now but
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
think that we should look at coming back
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
to it later to possibly
 
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.650 align:start position:0%
to it later to possibly
um

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
make it auto index so we don't have to
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
keep raising it manually
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I I think that
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
of uh the several County governance
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
bills that we've received in this um
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
session many deal with the balance of
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
power between County delegations and
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
and care of the county buildings and
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
lands is one of those issues and so I I
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with the original intent of the
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
do you representative color
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how this has to do
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
with balance of power this is just about
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
Taxation and so I'm just wanting to get
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
some clarification on that thank you are
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
you Rising oh you just want
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
clarification on this would you like to
 
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
answer that representative or
 
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.329 align:start position:0%
answer that representative or
no

01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.789 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently the county does not pay taxes
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
on their property and it counters to say
 
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
shall not be taxed right and the
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
decision is made by the entire
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
delegation and the executive committee
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
in some look so this gives entire power
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
to the Commissioners so the shift of
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
balance of
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
power checks and balances are offset on
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.549 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
if I see none I I have one point on this
um

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
well I disagree with representative
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
manager puti's explanation I will say
 
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
the one reason that I will vote against
 
01:04:00.299 --> 01:04:01.930 align:start position:0%
the one reason that I will vote against
this

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:01.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
is during the discussion and the
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
testimony it appeared that the issue was
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
specific to Sullivan County and there
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the budding of heads
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
between the assessors and the
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the town
 
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.789 align:start position:0%
and the town
um

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'm adverse to
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
changing rsas
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
based on a single situation where I
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
think Sullivan County may want to
 
01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:33.470 align:start position:0%
think Sullivan County may want to
um

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
Go a different course of action rather
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
than attempting to change the rsas that
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
would apply to the entire
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
the entire state so I I would rise in in
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
support of the itel motion
 
01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
support of the itel motion

thank you Mr chair
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
um one of the other things that came up
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
in the discussion and the testimony was
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
the fact that many of New Hampshire's
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
Counties have adopted bylaws that govern
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
their operations
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
um Sullivan County does not seem to have
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
bylaws but bylaws would permit
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners and delegations
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
working together to conduct business in
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
all kinds of ways that is not
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
specifically outlined in the rsas but
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
would give them much more flexibility
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
and obviate the need for them to come to
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
us for permission to do these things and
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%

inexpedient to legislate
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%

chair
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
so during the hearing unfortunately the
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was not present to
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill as a result the bill
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
was introduced ad hoc
 
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.309 align:start position:0%
was introduced ad hoc
additionally

01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
their was an individual
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to be present to speak to the
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
bill from Rockingham County their
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
administrator and he also did not show
 
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.450 align:start position:0%
administrator and he also did not show
up

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:07.460 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
witnesses that it is it is optional but
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the point being is that there was a lack
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
of input and the ability for this
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee to ask questions
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
and in my mind therefore this committee
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
cannot make an informed recommendation
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
based on what transpired at the hearing
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power further
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
discussion representative manager Puti
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
again I did get a response from our
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
County Hillsborough County and it is one
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
of the issues that the county is facing
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
when it is
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
5000 is the ceiling to raise it to the
 
01:08:59.650 --> 01:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
10 000 will make the bidding or purchase
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
on basic necessity for a large County
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
like Hillsboro uh would be helpful to
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
raise that so that they're not losing
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
competitive bidders because people are
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
not interested in waiting for the
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
bidding so I would
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
say I understand that there was no
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
presentation no questioning so I see the
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
reasoning uh but I would vote against
 
01:09:30.839 --> 01:09:33.169 align:start position:0%
reasoning uh but I would vote against
itl

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
um and I am in concurrence with uh
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
on on this matter that um the prime
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
sponsor was not here to provide us with
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to to reach an
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
informed decision and also note that it
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
is the tradition we try to maintain this
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
tradition when possible in this
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
Committee of not changing the rsa's
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
shall I tell them that you rolled your
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
eyes when you saw my raised hand or
 
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
no I'm so glad that you laughed Mr chair
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I want to come yes
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
absolutely we must I want to make two
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
comments one is in regards to the
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
absence of the representative
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
um someone said he wasn't feeling well
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then I saw him later in the day
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get a chance to speak to him the
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know what
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
happened to the county representative
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
who was supposed to come talk to us
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
um yet I do also realize that all these
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
people that we're dealing with are just
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
people they're human beings stuff
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
happens the second thing I want to say
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
is like the other Bill we discussed I
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to come into the at least
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
the 20th century in regards to how much
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
things cost and we all know I filled up
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
my gas tank today I won't tell you how
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
much I put in
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so I will not be voting in favor of
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
the itl thank you
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comments
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.250 align:start position:0%
well uh
the

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
while the prime sponsor might not have
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
been here in the Rockingham County
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
official might not have been here
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
um I was just rechecking my notes and it
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
um Derek ferland who from Sullivan
 
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.450 align:start position:0%
um Derek ferland who from Sullivan
County

01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
um who was testifying on all of the
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
other bills gave testimony on this one
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
as well so it's not like we had no
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on it we we did have some just
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
not from
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
the people that we were hoping it would
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
be from
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um I I think regardless from
 
01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um I I think regardless from
that

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.250 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:02.510 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%

if during any of the hearings somebody

02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:32.100 align:start position:0%

02:56:53.690 --> 02:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
he's going to introduce the last bill
 
02:56:56.450 --> 02:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
from Ashley Laurie okay yeah I thought
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
you talked with me last night about that
 
02:56:59.809 --> 02:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
so okay very good
 
02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to get going here it's
 
02:57:04.610 --> 02:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh 1 30. I'm gonna open up the uh public
 
02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 44 relative to permissible
 
02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.570 --> 02:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
I assume I am looking at rep McWilliams
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
very good it's yours your floor thank
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
you so much Mr chair I'm going to
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
co-present with a former representative
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
Ivy band just for the record it'll be
 
02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
both of us
 
02:57:31.370 --> 02:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
um my name is representative Rebecca
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I represent South Concord I'm
 
02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
a mom of could you do me a favor pull
 
02:57:39.230 --> 02:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
that mic a little closer to thank you
 
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm a mom of three I hope
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
that all three of my children will one
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
day grow up to live in New Hampshire and
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
I think housing is probably the most
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
important thing we're talking about for
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
my generation so this bill is for my
 
02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids and also for me
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh just want to make things very
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
clear there should be an amendment that
 
02:58:00.969 --> 02:58:00.979 align:start position:0%
all of you should have had passed out
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
the top of the page says
 
02:58:07.870 --> 02:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh January 12 2023
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
2023-0029h please make sure you're
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment that's what I'd
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak to today it's a proposed
 
02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
amendment just to clarify a couple
 
02:58:16.849 --> 02:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
things slightly slightly different than
 
02:58:19.809 --> 02:58:19.819 align:start position:0%
the initial bill as filed
 
02:58:21.650 --> 02:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
so let me know if you don't have that
 
02:58:23.929 --> 02:58:23.939 align:start position:0%
I've got extras and there's some on the
 
02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
table as well all right so let's talk
 
02:58:31.130 --> 02:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
about how spill 44. this is a reprise
 
02:58:32.690 --> 02:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
we've seen this bill before in front of
 
02:58:34.130 --> 02:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
this committee and we've actually passed
 
02:58:35.809 --> 02:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
it out of this committee on a bipartisan
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
fashion previously it's back
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the intention of this bill is very
 
02:58:46.670 --> 02:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
simple we are trying to do a Statewide
 
02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
fix to resolve an issue that seems to
 
02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
have crept into many of our local
 
02:58:55.070 --> 02:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal zoning authorities
 
02:58:57.530 --> 02:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
and so what I'm saying is we have
 
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
restricted our zoning as a state in a in
 
02:59:02.750 --> 02:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
a blanket statement we have restricted
 
02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:04.979 align:start position:0%
our zoning so that single family is
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
pretty much the rule of the land and in
 
02:59:11.389 --> 02:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
many instances that is hurting us for
 
02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
having more housing and more units in
 
02:59:15.530 --> 02:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
existing buildings because we aren't
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
able to break down an existing building
 
02:59:20.809 --> 02:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
from a single family into up to four
 
02:59:24.650 --> 02:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
units so this is a Statewide fix to what
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
I see as too much over regulation at the
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
municipal level for the past 25 years or
 
02:59:31.859 --> 02:59:32.630 align:start position:0%
municipal level for the past 25 years or
so

02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:35.690 --> 02:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
so we call this bill affectionately a
 
02:59:37.309 --> 02:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
fourplex is a house
 
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
meaning if you can have a single family
 
02:59:41.690 --> 02:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
residential house in some of the areas
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about you can also
 
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
split it up into a fourplex with all
 
02:59:49.730 --> 02:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
kinds of asterisks and caveats but big
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
picture think fourplex is a house when
 
02:59:53.929 --> 02:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
you think house bill 44.
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
so what does this mean
 
02:59:58.730 --> 02:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is about 37
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
percent of all municipalities in the
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
state so this is only impacting a third
 
03:00:07.849 --> 03:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
of the state and then when we talk about
 
03:00:10.370 --> 03:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
land area it's actually much much less
 
03:00:12.590 --> 03:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
than a third of the state because really
 
03:00:14.809 --> 03:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
this bill is only about areas that
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
actually have Municipal Water and Sewer
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
so if you live in a town that has
 
03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer it may only be
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
to the downtown it may only be the Main
 
03:00:27.050 --> 03:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
Street and a couple of side streets that
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
extend off of that that is the area that
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
is impacted by this fourplex is a house
 
03:00:34.849 --> 03:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
Statewide bill
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
so if you live in a rural area and you
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a municipal County a
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer you need both
 
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
then this bill does not impact you or
 
03:00:45.410 --> 03:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
your constituents at all it is simply
 
03:00:47.570 --> 03:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
those areas that have Municipal Water
 
03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
and Sewer will be held to the standard
 
03:00:52.010 --> 03:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
allowing you to take an existing
 
03:00:54.290 --> 03:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
building that would typically just be a
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
single family and split it up into four
 
03:00:59.210 --> 03:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
units a couple other caveats in addition
 
03:01:01.130 --> 03:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
to having to have Municipal Water and
 
03:01:03.710 --> 03:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
Sewer you also need to meet state code
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
so if you would be subject to having to
 
03:01:08.809 --> 03:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
do a sprinkler system in your multi-unit
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
building you still have to do that you
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
can't get away with that you must
 
03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
sprinkle your building
 
03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
parking parking is huge parking still
 
03:01:19.730 --> 03:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
applies and that's the reason that I
 
03:01:21.530 --> 03:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
made sure that we rewrote this amendment
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
to super super clarify
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you have a parking requirement for
 
03:01:27.530 --> 03:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
your municipality that says you need to
 
03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
have a certain number of spaces for a
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
certain number of bedrooms that still
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
applies this bill does not get around
 
03:01:35.330 --> 03:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
parking minimums
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
same thing with side yard and front yard
 
03:01:40.429 --> 03:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
setbacks they still apply you can't
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
expand your footprint or build something
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
bigger on an empty lot that's within a
 
03:01:48.530 --> 03:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer District you
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
can only build what you would normally
 
03:01:53.330 --> 03:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
be able to build but a fourplex is a
 
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
house so I'm going to turn this over to
 
03:01:56.929 --> 03:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
Ivy band add a little bit more to what I
 
03:01:58.969 --> 03:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
just explained can you pass this out
 
03:02:02.809 --> 03:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
excuse me before uh
 
03:02:04.370 --> 03:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
I know
 
03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
the honor roll Ivy van was a rep are is
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
she still around no
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
I am not okay
 
03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:12.889 align:start position:0%
I am not okay
um

03:02:12.889 --> 03:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
actually we have pink cards up here
 
03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to go in the order of pink
 
03:02:19.309 --> 03:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
cards uh did you fill out a pin card oh
 
03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
yes I will have you speak after uh the
 
03:02:24.410 --> 03:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
other individuals
 
03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:30.469 align:start position:0%
other individuals
um

03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.809 --> 03:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
there's not enough but Rebecca's gonna
 
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
pass out
 
03:02:37.490 --> 03:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
um some precedent Gallery photographs of
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about when we talk
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
about duplexes triples and quads I'm
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
sorry to say that my printer is not fast
 
03:02:45.710 --> 03:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
enough to produce one for everyone on
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
the committee but there's a bunch of
 
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
them and you can share them
 
03:02:57.050 --> 03:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:13.969 --> 03:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
all right so before I give up the
 
03:03:13.979 --> 03:03:15.349 align:start position:0%
all right so before I give up the
microphone

03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'm of course happy to answer any
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions and the handout is really
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
helpful for visual people like myself
 
03:03:23.809 --> 03:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
I'm an architect this picture's worth a
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
thousand words
 
03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
um just looking at some of the potential
 
03:03:28.730 --> 03:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
housing types that could
 
03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh be infill in some of these missing
 
03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
teeth lots that are serviced by
 
03:03:35.929 --> 03:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer still have to
 
03:03:37.490 --> 03:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
meet the side yard setbacks still need
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
to meet fire protection still need to
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
beat parking but you could have four
 
03:03:43.250 --> 03:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
units so
 
03:03:48.290 --> 03:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.650 --> 03:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman good afternoon
 
03:03:56.210 --> 03:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
I come with a from a small community
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
where we have a small uh water
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant and also
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
small water system
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
and we have a master plan so we know in
 
03:04:09.050 --> 03:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
so many years we're going to have to put
 
03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
up a new treatment plant
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
if this was to pass you would probably
 
03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
cost a ton of wolf ball between 50 and
 
03:04:18.530 --> 03:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars because we have to
 
03:04:21.170 --> 03:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
expand our wastewater treatment plan how
 
03:04:23.330 --> 03:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
can I justify that to the to the people
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
that I represent
 
03:04:28.370 --> 03:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about having existing
 
03:04:31.610 --> 03:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water in Wolfeboro and also
 
03:04:33.710 --> 03:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
the and there are some empty lots that
 
03:04:35.690 --> 03:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
are serviced by this existing municipal
 
03:04:37.490 --> 03:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
water and some houses who could be
 
03:04:40.250 --> 03:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
subdivided within that area and so the
 
03:04:42.110 --> 03:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
demand would increase on your existing
 
03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water tremendous you know also
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the the treatment of the uh yeah the
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
septic absolutely and I believe your
 
03:04:51.889 --> 03:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
taxes would also increase on each of
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
those units and the newly developed Lots
 
03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:57.050 align:start position:0%
those units and the newly developed Lots
correct

03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:04:59.450 --> 03:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they'd increase to will
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
we spending 50 to 100 million dollars to
 
03:05:04.030 --> 03:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
accommodate that would would balance out
 
03:05:07.250 --> 03:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and um I'm
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to do a bunch of
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
math and kind of throw numbers at you
 
03:05:13.250 --> 03:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
but I think it's worth analyzing a big
 
03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
picture of course the intention here is
 
03:05:17.330 --> 03:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
to build more housing in New Hampshire
 
03:05:18.889 --> 03:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
because we are desperate for more
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire and if build
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
more housing means subdivide an existing
 
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
house that could turn into up to four
 
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
units then that's the intention of the
 
03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
Bill of course that will increase the
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
amount of waste coming from the building
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the demand for water coming from the
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
building but that's sort of the
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
direction the state needs to go because
 
03:05:38.929 --> 03:05:38.939 align:start position:0%
we haven't for so long we have pent-up
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.809 --> 03:05:46.819 align:start position:0%
representative uh power
 
03:05:49.490 --> 03:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon and
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill
 
03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill
um

03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:59.210 --> 03:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
involves single-family Lots on which all
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
the setbacks will still pertain
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
so my question and it's to allow on that
 
03:06:08.889 --> 03:06:08.899 align:start position:0%
single family lot
 
03:06:11.450 --> 03:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
additional units to be built so the
 
03:06:13.849 --> 03:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
question is is with regards to like say
 
03:06:16.490 --> 03:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
for example you want to put four units
 
03:06:20.210 --> 03:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
on the single family lot is how do we
 
03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
deal with or is this something already
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
in local ordinances with regards to the
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
setbacks between the units
 
03:06:33.170 --> 03:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
do you understand the question well I I
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
meant spacing between I
 
03:06:38.450 --> 03:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
I do understand the question
 
03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:39.889 align:start position:0%
I do understand the question
so

03:06:39.889 --> 03:06:39.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
it depends on the size of the lot what
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
you're envisioning is probably a two to
 
03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
five acre lot with four tiny houses
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's probably the image you have in
 
03:06:50.929 --> 03:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
your mind but when I'm talking about
 
03:06:53.090 --> 03:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
downtown lots that have Municipal Water
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
and Sewer they're probably more like a
 
03:06:58.250 --> 03:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
half acre maybe one acre lots so really
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
what we're envisioning is a single
 
03:07:02.690 --> 03:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
structure that has party walls if it's a
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
duplex it's just got a vertical or
 
03:07:07.309 --> 03:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
horizontal party wall so it's fire rated
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
between the two units if one of them
 
03:07:11.769 --> 03:07:11.779 align:start position:0%
burns down the other hopefully doesn't
 
03:07:14.450 --> 03:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
so it's not really about the setback
 
03:07:18.469 --> 03:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
between units however for those downtown
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
lots that are served by Municipal Water
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
and Sewer and do have the acreage to
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
support individual buildings we would
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
look to the municipalities requirements
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
for distance between the buildings so
 
03:07:32.650 --> 03:07:32.660 align:start position:0%
those are still valid there's no change
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
from this legislation to the municipal
 
03:07:38.090 --> 03:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
rules for setbacks between units on one
 
03:07:38.100 --> 03:07:41.809 align:start position:0%
rules for setbacks between units on one
lot

03:07:41.809 --> 03:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.819 --> 03:07:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.170 --> 03:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:07:51.050 --> 03:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
isn't this very similar to what we used
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
to have back in the days double triple
 
03:08:01.010 --> 03:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
Decker where multi-family homes lived in
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
a small lot with before the car parking
 
03:08:09.889 --> 03:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
uh thing raised how would it impact or
 
03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
in a positive way or negative way for
 
03:08:16.990 --> 03:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
communities which is livable walkable
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
communities live work and play in the
 
03:08:22.969 --> 03:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
same area kind of thing that reduces the
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
need for car
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
how would it impact or enhance a
 
03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
community's vibrancy
 
03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
all right I'm seeing two parts to the
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
question the first part is the history
 
03:08:39.769 --> 03:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
of multi-family in New Hampshire New
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire much like the rest of New
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
England started to adopt parking
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
minimums and single-family zoning
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
mid-century last century and that really
 
03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.389 align:start position:0%
mid-century last century and that really
reduced

03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
03:08:57.650 --> 03:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
the tools available in our toolkit it
 
03:08:59.650 --> 03:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
reduced our ability to develop
 
03:09:02.210 --> 03:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
multi-family because of zoning that
 
03:09:04.849 --> 03:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
prevented multi-family from being built
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
so historically we have some really
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful downtowns across the state
 
03:09:10.969 --> 03:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
that have I'm just going to describe an
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
example some beautiful old Victorian
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
buildings that when they were built in
 
03:09:18.050 --> 03:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
the early 1900s were either rooming
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
houses or an in a really big square
 
03:09:24.050 --> 03:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
footage and and over the years they've
 
03:09:26.330 --> 03:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
been adapted and often turn into
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
multiple units for dwelling we have
 
03:09:30.769 --> 03:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
those buildings
 
03:09:33.290 --> 03:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
right now if a building like that occurs
 
03:09:35.570 --> 03:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
and is not grandfathered which okay it
 
03:09:38.210 --> 03:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
does happen it's in single-family zoning
 
03:09:39.769 --> 03:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
it still needs to be occupied by a
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
single family unless someone goes for a
 
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
variance within the municipality it's
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
arduous it's expensive it's hard to do
 
03:09:48.230 --> 03:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
that process this would take that
 
03:09:50.210 --> 03:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
existing gorgeous Victorian that you're
 
03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
stuck with as a single family and allow
 
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
you to partition off the third floor in
 
03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
the Attic as a unit provided you meet
 
03:09:59.090 --> 03:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
the parking requirements the setback
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
fire protection it just allows someone
 
03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
who already owns that building to do
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
what the intention was for that building
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
all along when it was first built but
 
03:10:09.410 --> 03:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're now in this pickle where we've
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
just constrained ourselves with Zoning
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
for the last 25 years that we are
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
bursting at the seams with desire for
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
more housing so this is in response to
 
03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
that that was number one the history
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
number two in terms of parking once
 
03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
again we are talking about
 
03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
city sewer City Water generally downtown
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
areas so some of the nice amenities that
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
we have in downtowns already attract
 
03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
younger people to want to be within
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
walking distance to the cafe coffee the
 
03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
bar drinks you want to be able to walk
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
home from both of those generally if
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're choosing to live in a downtown
 
03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:47.030 align:start position:0%
you're choosing to live in a downtown
area

03:10:47.030 --> 03:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
so while our parking requirements still
 
03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:51.349 align:start position:0%
so while our parking requirements still
apply

03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
apply
 
03:10:54.230 --> 03:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
you could choose not to use a car and to
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
be much more walkable because it's in
 
03:10:59.690 --> 03:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
that area and that's generally what
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
we're incentivizing in our beautiful
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
03:11:13.610 --> 03:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
your effort in this area
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh I have uh really two questions if I
 
03:11:22.250 --> 03:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
could first one is do you think that 70
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
percent of our communities are right in
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the legislating that the 30 percent that
 
03:11:34.610 --> 03:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
may not want this zoning has to
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.290 --> 03:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
well isn't that the conundrum of being a
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislator right we we're reps we're
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
elected to make rules for the entire
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
State and that's what we do in order to
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
solve big problems right I wouldn't be
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
bringing this before you if it wasn't a
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
big problem and it's looking for a
 
03:11:57.410 --> 03:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
solution that's been caused by
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
individual municipalities becoming
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
nimby's saying not in my backyard I
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to have multiple units in my
 
03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
don't want to have multiple units in my
town

03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:12:08.269 --> 03:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
so here we are starving for housing and
 
03:12:10.370 --> 03:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
we've we've legislated ourselves into a
 
03:12:13.250 --> 03:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
corner by local law creating these
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
single-family zoning districts that we
 
03:12:18.769 --> 03:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
have the services to do more with that
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of infrastructure we absolutely
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
could do more with and in terms of
 
03:12:24.530 --> 03:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
walkability stumble home from the bar
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
distance it's the right spot to do it
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
and yet here we are it's been 25 years
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
of fighting this battle something's got
 
03:12:34.730 --> 03:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
to give so I hear what you're saying
 
03:12:36.769 --> 03:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
about the majority forcing something on
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
the minority but that's part of being a
 
03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
politician is solving a really difficult
 
03:12:43.730 --> 03:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
problem and certainly this has become a
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
difficult problem follow up Mr chairman
 
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think our responsibility is religious
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
ladies would you wouldn't you believe
 
03:12:56.450 --> 03:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
that it's more to follow the majority
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
not the minority I just as a side I live
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
in a community that doesn't have water
 
03:13:05.450 --> 03:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have sewage we're not going
 
03:13:09.530 --> 03:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
to be affected by this at all and I I
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
like this idea
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just really concerned and I don't
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
know what you can do to help me when you
 
03:13:19.730 --> 03:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
say that this bill says shall and once I
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
see that word
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
as a legislator
 
03:13:27.050 --> 03:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
I feel that the real concern as to what
 
03:13:28.570 --> 03:13:28.580 align:start position:0%
that shall
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
requires and what the unintended
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
consequences are thank you thank you for
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
your effort thank you any further to
 
03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:37.610 align:start position:0%
your effort thank you any further to
humans

03:13:37.610 --> 03:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
humans
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Holland thank you Mr
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
chair I have a theoretic clarifying
 
03:13:45.769 --> 03:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
question for you so suppose I have a
 
03:13:48.410 --> 03:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
one-story Ranch on a half acre lot
 
03:13:51.650 --> 03:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's in a residential Zone under this
 
03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
legislation would I have to then it's
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
really pretty hard to cut up that one
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
floor Ranch do I expand that into
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
another uh larger you know multi-unit
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
setup or would I be allowed to add a
 
03:14:08.929 --> 03:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
detached you know from this list another
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
unit on the lot as long as it met all
 
03:14:13.010 --> 03:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
the setback and height requirements
 
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's the beauty of this legislation it
 
03:14:15.889 --> 03:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
leaves it up to your local
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities requirements so you would
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
look to whatever your municipality says
 
03:14:22.730 --> 03:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
for that lot for those setbacks for
 
03:14:24.170 --> 03:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
whether or not you can have a detached
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
Adu not every town allows that but if
 
03:14:32.210 --> 03:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
everybody around the table if you have
 
03:14:35.690 --> 03:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
your mics on please turn them off
 
03:14:38.210 --> 03:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
because it reduces the uh the pickup on
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:14:49.730 --> 03:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
03:14:52.969 --> 03:14:52.979 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that this isn't you're not
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
mandating that every
 
03:14:58.670 --> 03:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
single family Victorian house be
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
converted into four structures but if
 
03:15:05.290 --> 03:15:05.300 align:start position:0%
the property owner who has that house
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
wants to opt into that provision he has
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:14.690 --> 03:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
as long as he meets the parking
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
requirements rights and parking setbacks
 
03:15:20.210 --> 03:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
and all that yes right you're not
 
03:15:22.490 --> 03:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
forcing this on this does not force
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
development right thank you
 
03:15:30.530 --> 03:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
use your mic representative Brown thank
 
03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:34.010 align:start position:0%
use your mic representative Brown thank
you

03:15:34.010 --> 03:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know you had to shut them off so
 
03:15:38.870 --> 03:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure that I
 
03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
understand this permit by right means
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
that the landowner has the right to do
 
03:15:45.769 --> 03:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
this work
 
03:15:48.170 --> 03:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
as long as it conforms with all the
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
other zoning requirements without
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
getting special approval from the towns
 
03:15:55.250 --> 03:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
so that just follow up there this is the
 
03:16:02.450 --> 03:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
question so that requires
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
sorry that requires
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
the town to approve this regardless of
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
whether they want multi-family homes in
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
a certain area of their Community is
 
03:16:15.889 --> 03:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's no approval process it's by
 
03:16:21.889 --> 03:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
right right but it would need to happen
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
if a developer
 
03:16:27.050 --> 03:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
is in Municipal Water and Sewer meets
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the parking meets the setbacks has an
 
03:16:30.170 --> 03:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
existing building they'd like to
 
03:16:32.750 --> 03:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
subdivide they can sprinkler it
 
03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
there's no variance process by the
 
03:16:39.410 --> 03:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
municipality it goes through they still
 
03:16:41.090 --> 03:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
need a building permit so the
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to give the
 
03:16:45.050 --> 03:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
permit provided all the permit
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.210 --> 03:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
just uh clarifying point about
 
03:16:59.450 --> 03:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
um legislative history so you mentioned
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the bill coming out of
 
03:17:05.870 --> 03:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
um our committee last term on a
 
03:17:09.530 --> 03:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis but um I don't I I
 
03:17:10.969 --> 03:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
didn't quite catch whether you included
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
the number or not but just to confirm
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
this was um House Bill 1177 last term
 
03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:17.809 align:start position:0%
this was um House Bill 1177 last term
right

03:17:17.809 --> 03:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.929 --> 03:17:25.939 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
03:17:28.250 --> 03:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure this right
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
so based on what this legislation does
 
03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:33.530 align:start position:0%
so based on what this legislation does
it

03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:17:36.530 --> 03:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
basically requires the town to allow
 
03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
this development because the landlord
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
Lando is requesting if it meets all the
 
03:17:41.340 --> 03:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
Lando is requesting if it meets all the
other

03:17:42.230 --> 03:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
Town requirements is that correct that
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
are already existing
 
03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
so you've got a landowner who owns a lot
 
03:17:51.170 --> 03:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
downtown Municipal Water and Sewer they
 
03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
have Architects plans for a four unit
 
03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
building it's a small lot so it's going
 
03:17:57.950 --> 03:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
to be tall it meets the height
 
03:17:59.389 --> 03:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
requirements it meets all the
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
requirements but it's multiple units the
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
town would have to say yes to a building
 
03:18:06.230 --> 03:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
permit for that there's no additional
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
appeal variance process that would
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
prevent this from happening
 
03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr chairman
 
03:18:22.010 --> 03:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking additional
 
03:18:22.020 --> 03:18:23.650 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking additional
questions

03:18:23.650 --> 03:18:23.660 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
we talked about unintended consequences
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
is it possible that one of those
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences would be the
 
03:18:31.800 --> 03:18:33.650 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences would be the
delay

03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
delay
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
um a rejection of communities putting in
 
03:18:41.650 --> 03:18:41.660 align:start position:0%
water and sewage like the previous
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
question said that they had the water
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have the sewage wouldn't
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
that just discourage that Community from
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
putting a surgeon and then buying into
 
03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:58.790 align:start position:0%
putting a surgeon and then buying into
this

03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
I understand the question you're asking
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a calculus that
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on the value of the
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
increase in taxes for multiple units
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
versus single family and it really
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
depends on how each of those
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities calculates the long-term
 
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
benefit for increase in taxes versus the
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
long-term cost for adding water and or
 
03:19:23.150 --> 03:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
sewer or both so this is at the local
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
level making that decision about their
 
03:19:26.690 --> 03:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
10-year plan where they will extend
 
03:19:28.250 --> 03:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer
 
03:19:30.410 --> 03:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
they will also have to take into that
 
03:19:33.889 --> 03:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
math what the value is of the taxes of a
 
03:19:36.170 --> 03:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
multi-unit and that's not saying it will
 
03:19:38.570 --> 03:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
happen just that it could so there's a
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of developable lots that's
 
03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
the math that would need to be
 
03:19:45.530 --> 03:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
considered to make that decision
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
I think thank you for your question it's
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
always nice to hear them thank you
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
chairman representative welcome
 
03:19:53.929 --> 03:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:57.349 align:start position:0%
my question
um

03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:00.410 --> 03:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
in my town we recently had a major fire
 
03:20:03.710 --> 03:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
where our water system couldn't maintain
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
water pressure to fight that fire
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
um our water system isn't capable of
 
03:20:10.439 --> 03:20:12.290 align:start position:0%
um our water system isn't capable of
supporting

03:20:12.290 --> 03:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
03:20:15.650 --> 03:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure like this like if
 
03:20:17.929 --> 03:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
this was passed it would impact Us and
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you propose we deal
 
03:20:22.849 --> 03:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
with that consequence if that if this
 
03:20:22.859 --> 03:20:23.929 align:start position:0%
with that consequence if that if this
passes

03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
passes
 
03:20:26.510 --> 03:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
and we have that problem
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's a really tough situation because
 
03:20:29.929 --> 03:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have the pressure
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
right now to respond to another fire
 
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
right so you're kind of in an emergency
 
03:20:35.090 --> 03:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
situation you're responding you're
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
figuring out next steps right
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not this bill
 
03:20:41.330 --> 03:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
passes I think you're kind of in a
 
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
situation where you need to make a
 
03:20:44.330 --> 03:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
decision about long-term bonding for
 
03:20:45.410 --> 03:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
your water
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
because you have a potential another
 
03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
fire you're gonna have people who get
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
rejected for insurance if they can't
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
fight fires in your town that's like
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very specific concern and it's
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
legitimate but I think you're probably
 
03:20:57.769 --> 03:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
going to have to do some kind of major
 
03:20:59.389 --> 03:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
monetary investment in order to address
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill go ahead
 
03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
if you give everyone the right to do
 
03:21:11.450 --> 03:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
that which would give them the right to
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
do this
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
it would force us into even more of an
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
emergency situation if if suddenly a lot
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
of people exercise their right
 
03:21:22.730 --> 03:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned insurance I think it's
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
important that we talk about the market
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
that we're in right now if you have
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone who sees these vacant Lots you
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
had a big fire they're probably some
 
03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
empty lots downtown with water and sewer
 
03:21:33.170 --> 03:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
right now developers sees those lots
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
considers putting in multi-family if
 
03:21:38.210 --> 03:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
they can't get the insurance because you
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the water pressure they can't
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
sell those units so it's a chicken and
 
03:21:44.809 --> 03:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
egg issue where it's not a salable
 
03:21:47.330 --> 03:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
building if you can't get insurance to
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
protect against future fire right so I
 
03:21:52.490 --> 03:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
see the concern but the reality of the
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
market is if you can't get insurance for
 
03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
a building you're trying to put in
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no one you can sell
 
03:21:58.610 --> 03:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
it to because they need to get a
 
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
mortgage and the bank requires Insurance
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
even if they want to hold it privately
 
03:22:04.250 --> 03:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
with a cash cash purchase they still
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
want insurance for the building so the
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
inability to ensure that basically puts
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
uh representative lasalles
 
03:22:19.849 --> 03:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Mr chairman and thank
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
um could it be that a local planning
 
03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
board that's in the situation my friend
 
03:22:32.570 --> 03:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
from Raymond is in where the town as a
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
whole is underserved
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh by the current infrastructure
 
03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
could a local planning board say well
 
03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
we're already in a bind here
 
03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to allow any more uh
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
of this sort of thing because it says if
 
03:22:55.969 --> 03:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
it's served by
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
could you make could a local planning
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
board make the argument that
 
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
in that case you're not being currently
 
03:23:09.530 --> 03:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:12.170 --> 03:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is such a very specific question
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay and I want to I want to give it the
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
Nuance that it deserves
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about a major fire
 
03:23:21.410 --> 03:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
empty lot there was a water and sewer
 
03:23:23.929 --> 03:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
hookup on the lot we know that the water
 
03:23:26.090 --> 03:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
can't meet the Demand right now and so
 
03:23:27.769 --> 03:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
the question is is it quote unquote
 
03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
legally served I think you probably
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
would end up tied up in litigation about
 
03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
that between the developer and the town
 
03:23:37.250 --> 03:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not it's served
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a question for a judge on
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
that one and so if the real question is
 
03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
is there a way for the town to delay
 
03:23:45.410 --> 03:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
multi-family development while
 
03:23:47.809 --> 03:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
addressing the water yes the answer is
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti thank you Mr
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
03:23:59.809 --> 03:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
taking another question from me isn't it
 
03:24:01.849 --> 03:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
true that currently
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
the number of bathrooms in a single
 
03:24:06.849 --> 03:24:06.859 align:start position:0%
family home
 
03:24:11.809 --> 03:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
determines the tax for that family home
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
so if you're adding four units adding
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
more bathrooms so the tax would go up so
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's a revenue to the city or the
 
03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:25.969 align:start position:0%
that's a revenue to the city or the
municipality

03:24:25.969 --> 03:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer to that I think
 
03:24:30.769 --> 03:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
it's Town specific and I'm also not an
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
expert on how taxes are set based on
 
03:24:35.570 --> 03:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
square footage bedrooms
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
toilet rooms it really depends so I
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
Russian Howell and I think you have your
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
finger up thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I'll give you
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
another theoretical I'm an investor I
 
03:24:54.170 --> 03:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
come into your town I come back to that
 
03:24:58.490 --> 03:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
that ranch on the half acre lot of my
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
incentive would be to probably demolish
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
that house build four luxury townhouses
 
03:25:07.610 --> 03:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
specifically because if it's served by
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and it's walkable to my
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
downtown its value is really great so
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
while it is adding housing it's really
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
not chipping away at the diverse housing
 
03:25:20.990 --> 03:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
or affordable housing is that a concern
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
so at this point in New Hampshire any
 
03:25:25.969 --> 03:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
housing is good housing and we can have
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
a long discussion about how building new
 
03:25:30.650 --> 03:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
units causes people to jump from their
 
03:25:32.750 --> 03:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
existing units to the new units and it
 
03:25:35.090 --> 03:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
frees up those existing units to more
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
affordable buyers or renters but big
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
picture you're increasing your tax base
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
from going from a single family ranch to
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
four townhouses so you're getting more
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
revenue on the municipal side
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
and you're getting a probably more
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
diverse renter owner for each of those
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
units as opposed to single family right
 
03:25:56.690 --> 03:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
people who live in townhouses aren't
 
03:25:58.969 --> 03:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same people who live in
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
raised ranches I'm speaking in Gross
 
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
generalities here but just to give you a
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
sense in many of our towns we have
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
concerns about where folks who are ready
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be empty nesters can go so providing
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
four new townhouses could be the hottest
 
03:26:18.410 --> 03:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:26:25.309 --> 03:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
like my colleague over here I'll give
 
03:26:27.290 --> 03:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
you a hypothetical if I if I take a
 
03:26:30.050 --> 03:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
single family with two children living
 
03:26:31.969 --> 03:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
it and I convert it to a four family
 
03:26:34.610 --> 03:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
with eight children living in it there's
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
still only one tax bill
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's one piece of property getting
 
03:26:41.929 --> 03:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
taxed and I'm possibly adding more tax
 
03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
burden by adding
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
more Demand on the school system
 
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm not increasing the taxes as much
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
as adding the cost to to teach those
 
03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
students you know those potential
 
03:26:56.100 --> 03:26:57.229 align:start position:0%
students you know those potential
students

03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:26:57.239 --> 03:26:59.090 align:start position:0%
students
I'm

03:26:59.090 --> 03:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
03:27:03.650 --> 03:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
how that is a potential cost
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
I like our hypothetical
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
if they're condos they're individually
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
taxed if they're one building with four
 
03:27:14.210 --> 03:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
units with one owner that's renting four
 
03:27:16.370 --> 03:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
units it's taxed as just one building so
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
it depends on the way it's built so yes
 
03:27:21.650 --> 03:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
no to the way it's taxed but I like your
 
03:27:21.660 --> 03:27:22.570 align:start position:0%
no to the way it's taxed but I like your
question

03:27:22.570 --> 03:27:22.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think we could probably have a whole
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
separate conversation about schools and
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
the cost of education for young people
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
in our state I will tell you that
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
statistically we are reducing the number
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
of students significantly year over year
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
in our schools we're on a downward trend
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
and part of that has to do with this
 
03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
conundrum that we don't have housing
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
so we as government officials are
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about correcting the market
 
03:27:55.130 --> 03:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
because we need to because we don't have
 
03:27:57.530 --> 03:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
housing for the Next Generation so I
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely like the question about the
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
cost of education and I I see where
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
you're going with that but the flip side
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
is if we don't have any houses at all
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
for people who have young kids they'll
 
03:28:10.490 --> 03:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
choose not to be in that Community
 
03:28:12.530 --> 03:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
altogether and you'll keep seeing
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks
 
03:28:22.729 --> 03:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:28:26.210 --> 03:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
so there's been a few questions about
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure demands if this is to
 
03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:30.110 align:start position:0%
infrastructure demands if this is to
pass

03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
um could you speak briefly please about
 
03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh traffic impacts in neighborhoods say
 
03:28:38.450 --> 03:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
the south end of Concord for example
 
03:28:40.010 --> 03:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
great question
 
03:28:40.020 --> 03:28:41.809 align:start position:0%
great question
so

03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize the reason I
 
03:28:45.530 --> 03:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
presented this amendment today is
 
03:28:48.710 --> 03:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it emphasizes parking right the
 
03:28:50.570 --> 03:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
parking requirements are the same as
 
03:28:52.849 --> 03:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
they have always been and so when we
 
03:28:55.130 --> 03:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
design infrastructure and we set parking
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
requirements in our local zoning it's
 
03:29:00.050 --> 03:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
making sure in addition to congestion
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
and too many cars on the road issues is
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's possible to park
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
the cars
 
03:29:08.450 --> 03:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
so we've already got a mechanism in
 
03:29:11.090 --> 03:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
place to protect against increases major
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
increases in traffic
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Concord is an interesting spot because
 
03:29:17.809 --> 03:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
when we talk about downtown Concord much
 
03:29:19.490 --> 03:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
of the units that we're allowing in
 
03:29:20.929 --> 03:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
downtown Concord actually have street
 
03:29:23.410 --> 03:29:23.420 align:start position:0%
parking and that's part of our zoning
 
03:29:27.889 --> 03:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
so not to go too far afield but if we
 
03:29:29.809 --> 03:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for two parking
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
spaces on the lot and an allowance for
 
03:29:34.969 --> 03:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
two parking spaces on the street that
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't change with this bill that's
 
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
still the same allowance and therefore
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
for those people uh who plan on speaking
 
03:29:48.410 --> 03:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
on this just so you know we have a very
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
long list we are going to put in a three
 
03:29:53.210 --> 03:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
minute time limit so make sure your
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
testimony is within that three minutes
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
we will not we will be giving you a 30
 
03:29:59.570 --> 03:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
second warning and that's going to be it
 
03:30:02.269 --> 03:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of speakers in fact we've
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
had you up here very long I have two
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
quick questions for you myself and then
 
03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
could you uh just tell me uh in line
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
five it talks about res residential
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
zoning why wouldn't this apply to
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.600 --> 03:30:26.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:30:26.650 --> 03:30:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.610 --> 03:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
the power is granted under this
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
subdivision the local legislative body
 
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
of a city town or county in which there
 
03:30:33.410 --> 03:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
are located unincorporated towns or
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
unorganized places shall allow as a
 
03:30:38.090 --> 03:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
matter of right any single-family lot in
 
03:30:40.130 --> 03:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
a residential zoning District served by
 
03:30:42.170 --> 03:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer so we're
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
talking about single-family Lots
 
03:30:45.729 --> 03:30:45.739 align:start position:0%
residential zoning District
 
03:30:48.290 --> 03:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the code that has
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
single-family lots and Commercial
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
districts but if that is the case I
 
03:30:55.849 --> 03:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
understand that generally in commercial
 
03:30:58.849 --> 03:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
you can still do Residential in a lot of
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
our zoning ordinances it's just
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
considered a lesser use
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about single-family
 
03:31:08.210 --> 03:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
lot zoning so really this is intended to
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
address some of those missing teeth
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
within the urban fabric whereas on
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
Commercial generally we're talking much
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
bigger buildings much bigger tenants so
 
03:31:20.110 --> 03:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying you can't do infill with
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
multi-family within a commercially zoned
 
03:31:24.650 --> 03:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
area but often towns have a really good
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
reason why they've zoned an area
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
commercial and they see that as a
 
03:31:29.809 --> 03:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
business district so introducing
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
multi-family into the business district
 
03:31:33.530 --> 03:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
may not meet the tax structure needs of
 
03:31:35.090 --> 03:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
the municipality in the way that they
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
set up their local planning
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
that the other question I have is
 
03:31:40.620 --> 03:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
that the other question I have is
um

03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
why only two uh
 
03:31:47.690 --> 03:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
single-family lots and water and sewer
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
let's as we have talked about examples
 
03:31:52.729 --> 03:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
let's say we you own a four acre lot
 
03:31:54.650 --> 03:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's in a residential district not
 
03:31:56.170 --> 03:31:56.180 align:start position:0%
served by
 
03:31:59.330 --> 03:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer yet you have the
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
capacity for a well and septic system
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
that would support a four unit why is
 
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
that not included
 
03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this bill was to strike
 
03:32:12.050 --> 03:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
a balance between the rural character of
 
03:32:13.729 --> 03:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
many of our towns that have those four
 
03:32:15.889 --> 03:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
acre lots and would prefer to keep it
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
much more Farmhouse trees Fields rather
 
03:32:23.809 --> 03:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
than downtown walkable Municipal Water
 
03:32:26.210 --> 03:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
and Sewer served areas thank you you're
 
03:32:26.220 --> 03:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
and Sewer served areas thank you you're
welcome

03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
I I would like to let some of the other
 
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
people testify and I'm happy to speak
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
with folks offline we are going to move
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
on to the next uh testifier we have
 
03:32:46.610 --> 03:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
hello uh thank you for the privilege of
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
speaking here today
 
03:32:51.960 --> 03:32:52.610 align:start position:0%
speaking here today
um

03:32:52.610 --> 03:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I represent Stratford District 17
 
03:32:59.809 --> 03:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
which is in Dover New Hampshire
 
03:33:02.210 --> 03:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
and I am semi-retired from the business
 
03:33:03.650 --> 03:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
of building
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
and renovating residential homes and
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
I've worked as my husband in the
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
Seacoast for the last 12 years
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
most of the work has been building
 
03:33:15.290 --> 03:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
 
03:33:17.809 --> 03:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
if we built a house on speculation and
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
we're lucky enough to find a lot that's
 
03:33:22.729 --> 03:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
it was usually the only option we had to
 
03:33:22.739 --> 03:33:24.889 align:start position:0%
it was usually the only option we had to
build

03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
build
 
03:33:27.370 --> 03:33:27.380 align:start position:0%
um and then it had to be a big one
 
03:33:30.050 --> 03:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
usually in order to cover the expense of
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
03:33:31.260 --> 03:33:32.809 align:start position:0%
the lot
so

03:33:32.809 --> 03:33:32.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
that was in a way prohibitive against
 
03:33:37.610 --> 03:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
building an affordable house for many
 
03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:40.250 align:start position:0%
building an affordable house for many
people

03:33:40.250 --> 03:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
but our last project that we finished in
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
Dover this past August was to build a
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
duplex close to downtown Dover
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
on a property that with an existing
 
03:33:53.570 --> 03:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
house that we rent out
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
it isn't what Dover calls the urban
 
03:33:55.620 --> 03:33:57.070 align:start position:0%
it isn't what Dover calls the urban
density

03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
density
 
03:33:59.690 --> 03:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
multi-residential District the house had
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
a large lot that could accommodate a
 
03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
a large lot that could accommodate a
duplex

03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
duplex
 
03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
so it's similar to what we are proposing
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
might happen with this bill
 
03:34:11.450 --> 03:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
um we built to play the duplex that
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
already fit within the setbacks and
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
other requirements of the city
 
03:34:19.450 --> 03:34:19.460 align:start position:0%
but we had to apply through a special
 
03:34:21.769 --> 03:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
zoning board of appeals for a special
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
exemption in order to do this conversion
 
03:34:27.889 --> 03:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I would say we're able to rent both
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
units before we had even finished
 
03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:30.969 align:start position:0%
units before we had even finished
construction

03:34:30.969 --> 03:34:30.979 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:34:34.849 --> 03:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
within 12 hours of posting the ad that
 
03:34:37.969 --> 03:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
is how crazy the demand is for housing
 
03:34:40.729 --> 03:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
in our area
 
03:34:40.739 --> 03:34:42.050 align:start position:0%
in our area
um

03:34:42.050 --> 03:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of new apartment
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
buildings being built in the Central
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
District part of Dover
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
most of them have units that are much
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
more expensive than what we were able to
 
03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:56.450 align:start position:0%
more expensive than what we were able to
build

03:34:56.450 --> 03:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
build
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
and most of them because they're large
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
are being built by out-of-state
 
03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:02.570 align:start position:0%
are being built by out-of-state
contractors

03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I have the impression not 100 sure
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
that most of that rent is also going out
 
03:35:12.050 --> 03:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
so we applaud the city of Dover for
 
03:35:17.210 --> 03:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
allowing these conversions and allowing
 
03:35:19.729 --> 03:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
in most of their districts
 
03:35:25.309 --> 03:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
but not all of our neighboring towns are
 
03:35:27.530 --> 03:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
allowing this they would prefer to keep
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
single family zoning
 
03:35:32.330 --> 03:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
and expect the people that work in their
 
03:35:35.210 --> 03:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
Town work in their restaurants and shops
 
03:35:38.210 --> 03:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
who are caring for their elderly
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
who are working in their schools in the
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
police departments to keep driving in
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
from other towns so that affects traffic
 
03:35:46.380 --> 03:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
from other towns so that affects traffic
and

03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:48.769 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:35:48.769 --> 03:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
and there's owning prohibits the
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
creation of affordable housing within
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
their town
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
and it's really not the best solution
 
03:35:59.090 --> 03:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
for our whole area sorry I'll try to rip
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
it up you need to wrap it up please okay
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you but what one town does affects
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
all of the other municipalities around
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
it in terms of their housing uh crisis
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the and demand
 
03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
um every town is land that can be used
 
03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
for urban or Village infill and there
 
03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
are many lots that could accommodate
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
more housing and still meet the
 
03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:22.250 align:start position:0%
more housing and still meet the
guidelines

03:36:22.250 --> 03:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one comment about
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
um fees the impact on sewer and water
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
many people end over including city
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
employees were shocked at the fees that
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
we paid to build two units we paid forty
 
03:36:37.250 --> 03:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars just in Impact fees
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
but it will raise money to cover sewer
 
03:36:40.849 --> 03:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
and water
 
03:36:43.250 --> 03:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much any
 
03:36:43.260 --> 03:36:44.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much any
questions

03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher um
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah that sounded like testimony in
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill but I don't think I
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
quite heard an explicit I'm in favor of
 
03:36:57.950 --> 03:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill or not could I yes I'm very
 
03:37:02.210 --> 03:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.429 --> 03:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair and just one
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
quick question uh has there been any
 
03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
success you said to Dover
 
03:37:15.170 --> 03:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
allows uh some maybe different house
 
03:37:18.050 --> 03:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
housing rules and regulations and others
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
has there been any success in proposing
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the 30 percent of the communities
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
that have sewer and water so many been
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
any success in asking them as individual
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
towns to accept this proposal
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't been involved in asking other
 
03:37:38.450 --> 03:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
towns what to accept
 
03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to see the city of Dover
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
make the process a little easier
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
reduce some of the restrictions that
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
were put on us to build it but we still
 
03:37:52.250 --> 03:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
were able to build it yeah follow up Mr
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
chairman if yes I could uh do you think
 
03:37:58.729 --> 03:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
it's a better approach is to ask every
 
03:38:01.610 --> 03:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
community that might qualify whether
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
they have water or sewer or not what do
 
03:38:06.530 --> 03:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
that they would accept this kind of a
 
03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
that they would accept this kind of a
proposal

03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay representative kale
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
03:38:14.570 --> 03:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
question I heard you mentioned impact
 
03:38:18.889 --> 03:38:18.899 align:start position:0%
fees and your 47 000 impact fee
 
03:38:22.370 --> 03:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
um actually it was a total amount of
 
03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
fees it wasn't just impact but when we
 
03:38:27.889 --> 03:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
added all the fees that was yeah
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
in this bill if it gives everyone the
 
03:38:32.809 --> 03:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
right to do this to the impact fees go
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
away or would they still be there
 
03:38:40.849 --> 03:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
very much call Representative Josh
 
03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:48.830 align:start position:0%
very much call Representative Josh
yokella

03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.090 --> 03:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to remind everybody three
 
03:38:53.170 --> 03:38:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh for the record my name
 
03:38:59.769 --> 03:38:59.779 align:start position:0%
is Joshua okella uh representing
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville and
 
03:39:02.160 --> 03:39:03.469 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville and
Brentwood

03:39:03.469 --> 03:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
Brentwood
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm also on the housing special
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
commission or special committee on
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
housing and so I definitely think that
 
03:39:11.929 --> 03:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
um a uh important issue that that we
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
need to consider these um
 
03:39:21.309 --> 03:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
different options especially because
 
03:39:24.290 --> 03:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's my contention that the the
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
government has been putting its thumb on
 
03:39:29.929 --> 03:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
the scale of reducing housing for a long
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
time and I see this as a way of reducing
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
the pressure of that thumb on the scale
 
03:39:38.690 --> 03:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
that is reducing the housing in in our
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
state and
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
um also I wanted to
 
03:39:42.779 --> 03:39:43.870 align:start position:0%
um also I wanted to
um

03:39:43.870 --> 03:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
bring to mind a a thought that uh is one
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of this this uh
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is that
 
03:39:58.849 --> 03:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
um the cost of producing
 
03:39:58.859 --> 03:39:59.870 align:start position:0%
um the cost of producing
um

03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:02.690 --> 03:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh like a mile of
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
of uh sewer and water is essentially a
 
03:40:09.769 --> 03:40:09.779 align:start position:0%
fixed cost and so if you can have uh
 
03:40:12.530 --> 03:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
divide that cost by a higher number of
 
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
people than you one would not have to
 
03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
build that second mile if you need to
 
03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
serve let's say 200 people you might
 
03:40:22.729 --> 03:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
only need that one mile instead of
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
having to build that second mile so then
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
03:40:29.690 --> 03:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
um A reduced cost as far as
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure build out because while
 
03:40:34.729 --> 03:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
you're may have to have a larger pipe or
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
whatever you don't have to go for that
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
second mile of pipe and so
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
there is a value in in the
 
03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:46.429 align:start position:0%
there is a value in in the
municipalities

03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh perspective as far as not having to
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
build as much infrastructure
 
03:40:54.530 --> 03:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
and therefore having more green space if
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
you have if that is one of your goals
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
but also from the um the homeowner's
 
03:41:03.769 --> 03:41:03.779 align:start position:0%
perspective that
 
03:41:05.410 --> 03:41:05.420 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
divided that uh you know like like say a
 
03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
hundred feet of Road Frontage
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
correlates to a certain amount of taxes
 
03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
and if that's divided up by four and
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
that now you have less taxes per
 
03:41:22.969 --> 03:41:22.979 align:start position:0%
individual on that that road so I think
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for both uh reducing
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
overall requirements for infrastructure
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
allowing more uh densely populated areas
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that were already meant to be densely
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
populated by
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
by being in these downtown areas and
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
allowing for more green open space areas
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
um because there is just only a certain
 
03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
number of people and so if you put them
 
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
all in one spot then there's less and so
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to throw those those ideas
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
out so that you can think about them
 
03:41:58.969 --> 03:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
when you're considering the bill so
 
03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:42:00.420 --> 03:42:02.330 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
representative

03:42:02.330 --> 03:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:04.250 --> 03:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
I hate to monopolize them sorry Mr
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
chairman it's a very important issue uh
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
could it be possible particularly where
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
you're on the housing subcommittee to
 
03:42:17.929 --> 03:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
get a list of all the communities that
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:22.680 --> 03:42:25.610 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:42:25.610 --> 03:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
I mean it's possible to get the
 
03:42:32.210 --> 03:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
communities like say the towns that have
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh sewer and water
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
um but even if I gave you that list
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
there would be a subset of those because
 
03:42:41.330 --> 03:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
not all of those might be serviced the
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
entire town right so are you looking for
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
just the communities that would be
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
affected or like the number of units
 
03:42:49.729 --> 03:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
within a community that would be
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
affected by the legislation as long as
 
03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
you refer to it as to what it is I am
 
03:42:58.610 --> 03:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking to see how big of an
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
impact this would have on the state as a
 
03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:02.990 align:start position:0%
impact this would have on the state as a
whole

03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:43:06.170 --> 03:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
oh if if that uh I just want I can I can
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%

group that you're on yeah and I'm sorry

to bring it up at this good stage yeah
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
we could have it be available uh I think
 
03:43:17.570 --> 03:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
it'd be uh
 
03:43:19.250 --> 03:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
piece of information it would be
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
worthwhile I appreciate the information
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%

um gave that statistic
 
03:43:38.210 --> 03:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
well 38 percent I know that she said
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
that she didn't list out the
 
03:43:42.410 --> 03:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities but but we have a rough
 
03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
statistic of 38 38 of municipality or 36
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
37 of of municipalities but if you would
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%

11 comprising the town of Exeter I'm
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
just going to go through some bullet
 
03:44:40.969 --> 03:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
points really quick because I know there
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
are other people who want to speak
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to bring the committee to
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
recall yesterday we heard a few bills
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
about the cost of rent for for
 
03:44:52.439 --> 03:44:53.330 align:start position:0%
about the cost of rent for for
um

03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
affordable units work Workforce units
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
whatever name you want to give them and
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
the people who are against those bills
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
all said we need more units more units
 
03:45:04.849 --> 03:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
more units we need more places for
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
people to live
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to also
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think in response to one of
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
Representative Guthrie's questions is
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we are not
 
03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:17.389 align:start position:0%
that we are not
um

03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:20.450 --> 03:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
clamping down Statewide on any any
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
zoning laws we are actually expanding
 
03:45:25.610 --> 03:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
property rights by letting single-family
 
03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
have some income and bring up the value
 
03:45:33.650 --> 03:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.929 --> 03:45:35.939 align:start position:0%
and I think the last thing I like to say
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
is on the remote sign-in sheet the
 
03:45:43.010 --> 03:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
commentary we have several PDFs and and
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
texts from uh many uh residents well
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
many many uh from all over the state and
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
there are 80 in support of this bill and
 
03:45:55.190 --> 03:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a post
 
03:45:59.889 --> 03:45:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman for taking my
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
question uh wouldn't this allow a person
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
like me to age in place instead of
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
staying in my single family home or
 
03:46:16.130 --> 03:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
selling it and moving to a downsizing if
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
I can convert my
 
03:46:22.190 --> 03:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
single family home into multi-family
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
at least I can entice my next Generation
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
to come live back or at least share the
 
03:46:30.170 --> 03:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
home with others younger than me
 
03:46:30.180 --> 03:46:33.710 align:start position:0%
home with others younger than me
absolutely

03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you
 
03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:36.769 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you
representative

03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh next the we will call the honorable
 
03:46:53.469 --> 03:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.729 --> 03:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal and County
 
03:46:59.809 --> 03:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
government it's nice to see you all
 
03:46:59.819 --> 03:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
government it's nice to see you all
again

03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to talk as I do all the time
 
03:47:08.210 --> 03:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
about why a fourplex is a house and why
 
03:47:10.490 --> 03:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
we should consider it one what the
 
03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
fourplex Bill does is say as everyone
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
before me has said it allows up to four
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
units it doesn't require four units it
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
allows up to four on any lot served by
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer there was a
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
question about well what if we don't
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
have enough Municipal Water in sewer
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
your planning department has the ability
 
03:47:34.490 --> 03:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
to turn down applications if you do not
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
have adequate capacity so you don't have
 
03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
to worry about being forced to do
 
03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
anything I just want to make that clear
 
03:47:46.490 --> 03:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't prohibit building a
 
03:47:48.050 --> 03:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
single-family house in any of these
 
03:47:51.250 --> 03:47:51.260 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods it just adds more choices
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're really short of Housing and we're
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
particularly short of housing in the
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
places that people want to live
 
03:48:02.570 --> 03:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
according to the AARP a pretty
 
03:48:04.690 --> 03:48:04.700 align:start position:0%
mainstream Community
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
62 percent of people would like to live
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a place that is walkable that's a
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
neighborhood where they can walk to buy
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
a quart of milk let their kid ride their
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
bicycle to buy a popsicle and get home
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
before it melts and in the immortal
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
words of my daughter Lily stumble home
 
03:48:23.470 --> 03:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
from the bar
 
03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:24.849 align:start position:0%
from the bar
[Music]

03:48:24.849 --> 03:48:24.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
those places are places served if there
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
is water and sewer those are the places
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
that have water and sewer are they close
 
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
in neighborhoods so what this bill does
 
03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
is allow those neighborhoods to develop
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the way that they would have done 50
 
03:48:43.610 --> 03:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
years ago if you look at any
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in New Hampshire or any
 
03:48:48.290 --> 03:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
place in the United States and I forgot
 
03:48:50.210 --> 03:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
to tell you this but this is what I do
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a living is I talk to I work as a
 
03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
municipal planner and this is an issue
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's a problem everywhere
 
03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:01.309 align:start position:0%
that's a problem everywhere
um

03:49:01.309 --> 03:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:04.010 --> 03:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
so these places are places where we want
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
to see infill we want to see gradual
 
03:49:11.210 --> 03:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
adding of units somebody said well what
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
if an out of town developer fourplexes
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
are not a product that's going to bring
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
the Toll Brothers Homes to your
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhood these buildings are built
 
03:49:24.530 --> 03:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
typically by two women in a pickup truck
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
three guys and a dog with a van they're
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
not big outfit jobs often they're rehabs
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
of existing buildings that are currently
 
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
occupied by two little old people who
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
can barely pay the taxes never mind
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
maintain it so this bill would help
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
people who are looking for houses
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
by creating more units and creating them
 
03:49:50.450 --> 03:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
where people want to live it helps
 
03:49:52.130 --> 03:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
people who are in houses that are too
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
big for them it helps municipalities
 
03:49:58.010 --> 03:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
when we put more units in existing
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods we get better use of our
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it costs I know you all
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
have heard me say this it costs 4.65
 
03:50:09.530 --> 03:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
central line foot to salt sand plow
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
ditch and mow a foot of town maintained
 
03:50:15.170 --> 03:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
Road in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
more units
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
makes that cost more bearable
 
03:50:23.570 --> 03:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
and why is it a fourplex that we settled
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
on two reasons fourplexes are house
 
03:50:28.370 --> 03:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
sized and therefore will fit into
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
existing neighborhoods also
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
you can get a beige mortgage for a
 
03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
fourplex FHA Freddie Mac Fannie Mae all
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
of those products will give you a beige
 
03:50:45.769 --> 03:50:45.779 align:start position:0%
mortgage for a fourplex it's just a
 
03:50:45.779 --> 03:50:46.849 align:start position:0%
mortgage for a fourplex it's just a
house

03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change anything that
 
03:50:52.269 --> 03:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
the local jurisdiction manages Now
 
03:50:55.729 --> 03:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
parking lot size lot coverage setbacks
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
frontages Building height types if you
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
want to adopt design standards you can
 
03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
adopt design standards
 
03:51:05.100 --> 03:51:05.630 align:start position:0%
adopt design standards
um

03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:08.090 --> 03:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
it improves if you could wrap it up
 
03:51:10.250 --> 03:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
please yep sure pass you three minutes
 
03:51:11.690 --> 03:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
um also I would remind anybody else
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to testify if you can keep
 
03:51:17.210 --> 03:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
the testimony to unique original
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
language in other words let's not get
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
into repeating what's already been
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
stated right so the point here is that
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
this bill lets neighborhoods change in
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
the way that they would have changed 50
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
years ago these are tools that we used
 
03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
to have in our toolboxes you used to be
 
03:51:37.370 --> 03:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
able to do this you can't now this is
 
03:51:39.410 --> 03:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
both a housing issue and a property
 
03:51:41.389 --> 03:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
rights issue and I think it's crucial
 
03:51:43.849 --> 03:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
that we adopt this at the state level
 
03:51:46.010 --> 03:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm happy to
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
take questions uh representative Brown
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman the question I
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
have actually two quick questions
 
03:51:53.220 --> 03:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
have actually two quick questions
um

03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
the first one is
 
03:52:00.130 --> 03:52:00.140 align:start position:0%
do these new multi-family homes
 
03:52:03.410 --> 03:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
impact adjacent single family homes in a
 
03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
negative way no there's plenty of
 
03:52:09.530 --> 03:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
evidence that there is no detriment to
 
03:52:11.330 --> 03:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
having multi-family next to single
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
family there's plenty of evidence that
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
it does quite the opposite because it
 
03:52:17.150 --> 03:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
provides a bigger base for your local
 
03:52:20.889 --> 03:52:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
the other point that you mentioned is
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not preclude the
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
planning board from approving
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
um from disapproving these for other
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
reasons absolutely yes because your
 
03:52:40.729 --> 03:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
zoning code typically has rules about
 
03:52:43.130 --> 03:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
how far from the side lot lines the
 
03:52:44.929 --> 03:52:44.939 align:start position:0%
building can be how many parking places
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
you have how much percentage of the lot
 
03:52:49.849 --> 03:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
you can cover with the building they may
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
have design standards you have to abide
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
by all of those and the amendment that
 
03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
you received one of the reasons for that
 
03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
amendment is it makes the adoption of
 
03:53:04.250 --> 03:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
this bill 2024 which would give a
 
03:53:07.190 --> 03:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction time to take a look at its
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
code and see if there's something that
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
they want to change before this takes
 
03:53:11.460 --> 03:53:13.910 align:start position:0%
they want to change before this takes
effect

03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for your response thank you so
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard the questions thank
 
03:53:19.729 --> 03:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
you very much uh next we are going to
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh also I'd remind everybody uh please
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
State whether you're for Against The
 
03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon I'm Michael Barrett
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the town planner for Durham New
 
03:53:37.080 --> 03:53:38.269 align:start position:0%
I'm the town planner for Durham New
Hampshire

03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and I'm speaking for myself as a
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
professional Town planner although I
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
think many people in Durham would agree
 
03:53:46.610 --> 03:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
with what I have to say
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I am personally very dedicated to the
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
housing issue I believe the state should
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
push me require municipalities to do
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
more I I believe that's important and
 
03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:02.450 align:start position:0%
more I I believe that's important and
legitimate

03:54:02.450 --> 03:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I am also a very strong supporter of
 
03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
mixed use and mixed building types
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
single families duplexes what we call
 
03:54:12.170 --> 03:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
missing middle row houses townhouses
 
03:54:14.690 --> 03:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
triple Deckers Cottage courts you know
 
03:54:17.330 --> 03:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
accessory Apartments all of this
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
um however what we think of as mixed-use
 
03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods in Portsmouth Manchester
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
older places they work and they're
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful but there was a different way
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
that we built 50 and 100 years ago we
 
03:54:31.849 --> 03:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
don't build that way anymore
 
03:54:34.630 --> 03:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of new construction
 
03:54:39.070 --> 03:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
is is pretty awful and without character
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I am opposed to this bill I believe
 
03:54:45.769 --> 03:54:45.779 align:start position:0%
something must be done we should move in
 
03:54:49.010 --> 03:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
this direction but this bill is uh goes
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
very very far and very honestly I think
 
03:54:54.410 --> 03:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
this could be very damaging
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to think very hard about
 
03:54:58.969 --> 03:54:58.979 align:start position:0%
this I've been a professional planner
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
for 35 years I've been dealing with
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
design development zoning and I'm very
 
03:55:06.530 --> 03:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about this and particularly
 
03:55:09.290 --> 03:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
for communities like Durham where we are
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
wrestling with student housing and
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
single-family neighborhoods being very
 
03:55:17.689 --> 03:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
very harmed by the hockey house you know
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
the even the women's volleyball team
 
03:55:21.769 --> 03:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
taking over a house and we are
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
struggling to manage this as I'm sure
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
they are in Plymouth and Keene in
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester and other places so if we
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
have to accept four units that'll be
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
very damaging
 
03:55:35.889 --> 03:55:35.899 align:start position:0%
um single families not sacrosanct
 
03:55:38.450 --> 03:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning must be dealt with
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
but this is this is too much I urge you
 
03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
to send it back for more work I would be
 
03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
very happy to help with that
 
03:55:50.450 --> 03:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
um imagine an old Street an old
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of of Bungalows say you
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
know 1920s relatively large Lots you
 
03:55:58.610 --> 03:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
know third of an acre lots you are
 
03:56:01.370 --> 03:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
forcing that Community to allow four
 
03:56:03.769 --> 03:56:03.779 align:start position:0%
unit buildings in that neighborhood if
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
they have water and sewer so you are
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
going to see a developer maybe one of
 
03:56:09.410 --> 03:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
the owners they'll say well I can't
 
03:56:11.330 --> 03:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
really fit four units that's a lot of
 
03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of bread I'm going to
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
scrape my Bungalow I'm going to build a
 
03:56:18.370 --> 03:56:18.380 align:start position:0%
new four unit building and unfortunately
 
03:56:21.229 --> 03:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
we've forgotten how to build attractive
 
03:56:23.170 --> 03:56:23.180 align:start position:0%
buildings in this country
 
03:56:25.969 --> 03:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
architecture most of us don't know how
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with that so what you're going
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
to see is a ugly four unit vinyl box and
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
not only that but it's typical to
 
03:56:37.729 --> 03:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
require two parking spaces per unit
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
maybe one and a half it depends but so
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a big ugly vinyl box
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
with no character in a historic
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and probably eight parking
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
spaces now if those eight parking spaces
 
03:56:52.729 --> 03:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
are in the front they're going to pave
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
their lot it's going to be all asphalt
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
it'll be atrocious hopefully they'll be
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the rear which is not so harmful for
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
the streetscape but people are still not
 
03:57:03.889 --> 03:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
going to be happy to be looking out
 
03:57:06.769 --> 03:57:06.779 align:start position:0%
their backyards at a sea of parking so
 
03:57:08.929 --> 03:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
the people in that neighborhood who who
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
live in modest Bungalows are going to
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
say what happened how did this happen I
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
thought zoning was here to protect us we
 
03:57:20.929 --> 03:57:20.939 align:start position:0%
need flexibility we need to push we need
 
03:57:23.809 --> 03:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
to deal with housing but this is way too
 
03:57:23.819 --> 03:57:24.790 align:start position:0%
to deal with housing but this is way too
much

03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
plus the way the ordinance is written
 
03:57:29.150 --> 03:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's one paragraph if you're going to do
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
something okay I mean there's so many
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
things you know can you can you add
 
03:57:36.110 --> 03:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
density provision it doesn't say it just
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
says lot size design standards are very
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
tricky we don't even do design site
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
review for duplexes
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're going to do it
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives should
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
develop model ordinances small towns
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't even have planners some have water
 
03:57:54.410 --> 03:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
and sewer they have no idea how to do
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
deal with design issues it could be a
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
disaster and parking alone is just will
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
will ruin it
 
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
um so there's a lot that could be done
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
um required designs we really do need
 
03:58:08.689 --> 03:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
you to open it up so there's a lot that
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
could be done I urge you to send it back
 
03:58:12.769 --> 03:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to work with them make it
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
incremental like the old ad law Adu law
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
which is excellent thank you for your
 
03:58:19.010 --> 03:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions
 
03:58:21.769 --> 03:58:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh next we're going to call uh
 
03:58:27.530 --> 03:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
Darren winum win him
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Darren winam
 
03:58:35.809 --> 03:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
oh I live in the town of Exeter I'm an
 
03:58:37.130 --> 03:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
economic development director have been
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years and uh pretty much
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with everything respectfully
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we just said
 
03:58:43.729 --> 03:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to come out this from a
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing point of view this is
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
de facto Workforce housing that's what
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
you've but that's what this creates
 
03:58:52.610 --> 03:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous Workforce problem
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
in this state particularly in the
 
03:58:57.290 --> 03:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
Seacoast nobody can find housing and I'm
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking nobody the larger companies are
 
03:59:01.250 --> 03:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
talking about moving because they can't
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
find employees
 
03:59:05.689 --> 03:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
this would help greatly right now what
 
03:59:07.010 --> 03:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
we have is
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
some communities are doing things that
 
03:59:11.210 --> 03:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
are progressive some are not a lot of
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
the communities that are next to my town
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
and other towns don't want to do this
 
03:59:20.110 --> 03:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
they expect us to do it and house their
 
03:59:22.729 --> 03:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
company's workers it's a tremendous
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
problem this is a very good bill it's
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
been kicked around for a long time I
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
think it's time to get this thing done
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say thank you
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you before you leave um
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
on your card it says town of Exeter I
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not representing a town of extra
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
just just an accident I've never filled
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
one of those out before I've just I have
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
an economic development consulting
 
03:59:44.990 --> 03:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
company thank you very much that's fine
 
03:59:45.000 --> 03:59:49.809 align:start position:0%
company thank you very much that's fine
yeah

03:59:49.809 --> 03:59:49.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.250 --> 04:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and H Grace for the
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we oppose this
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
bill we Advocate to preserve local
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
control and oppose Statewide zoning
 
04:00:09.889 --> 04:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
mandates as you might imagine and have
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
seen on display today uh our communities
 
04:00:13.969 --> 04:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
do disagree about appropriate responses
 
04:00:16.969 --> 04:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
to questions like this one raises
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and therefore we think that the
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislature should leave that in the
 
04:00:22.729 --> 04:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
hands of municipalities a number of you
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
asked specific questions today that I
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
did want to address
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
um representative McDonald uh gave a
 
04:00:33.410 --> 04:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
scenario of a new wastewater treatment
 
04:00:33.420 --> 04:00:35.570 align:start position:0%
scenario of a new wastewater treatment
facility

04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and representative Cahill about a uh
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
a water system
 
04:00:39.600 --> 04:00:40.250 align:start position:0%
a water system
um

04:00:40.250 --> 04:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
pressure line and I think those really
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
go to capacity which is a question that
 
04:00:45.229 --> 04:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
04:00:47.929 --> 04:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
um representative lasalles brought up
 
04:00:50.210 --> 04:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and in response to representative
 
04:00:52.729 --> 04:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
LaSalle's question
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
um which was what is the meaning of the
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
term served the answer was that's
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
something that we decided by the courts
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
and would require litigation we
 
04:01:01.969 --> 04:01:01.979 align:start position:0%
obviously don't want any municipalities
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
to have to go through litigation if at
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
all possible we would like clear laws to
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
be passed through the legislature that
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
everyone understands
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
um representative power who I know
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
stepped out of the room but she asked a
 
04:01:16.010 --> 04:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
specific question that I believe relates
 
04:01:16.020 --> 04:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
specific question that I believe relates
to

04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:19.610 --> 04:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
line seven and the term four single
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
units and it her question related to the
 
04:01:25.250 --> 04:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
spacing between those those units
 
04:01:25.260 --> 04:01:26.330 align:start position:0%
spacing between those those units
um

04:01:26.330 --> 04:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:26.340 --> 04:01:27.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
while it's possible that local rules May
 
04:01:30.180 --> 04:01:31.370 align:start position:0%
while it's possible that local rules May
apply

04:01:31.370 --> 04:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
um it's also possible that this
 
04:01:37.510 --> 04:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is written that would allow
 
04:01:40.729 --> 04:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
a individual owning that property to
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
develop for single units would override
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
any sort of local regulation to that end
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
so there
 
04:01:50.929 --> 04:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
is some complexity here that I don't
 
04:01:53.450 --> 04:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
know an answer to
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that feeds into uh
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks question about
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
traffic and um planning for that which
 
04:02:04.250 --> 04:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
again really relates back to
 
04:02:07.010 --> 04:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and really the role of
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
the planning board in assisting the
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
municipality and planning forward and we
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
think that should be a local decision
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
not something decided here in Concord
 
04:02:16.849 --> 04:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:02:21.290 --> 04:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for a brief informative
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
one minute and 40 seconds you're welcome
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:35.330 --> 04:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
Chris Norwood I am the 2023 public
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
policy chair for the New Hampshire
 
04:02:56.330 --> 04:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors and we would
 
04:02:58.370 --> 04:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
like to express our support of this bill
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
as we did similarly last year
 
04:03:04.370 --> 04:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
um In fairness to time just a couple
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
items to touch upon to put numbers on
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis uh 2022 saw the
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
median home price in our state to be 440
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that was 11 up of 2021
 
04:03:22.729 --> 04:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
and six percent over uh 2020 so
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
compounding per year
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh the average rental price for a two
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
bedroom in our state right now is just
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
shy of sixteen hundred dollars which is
 
04:03:32.750 --> 04:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
about increasing you know about five to
 
04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
seven percent each of the last five
 
04:03:37.729 --> 04:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
years so our view is is a supply uh
 
04:03:39.950 --> 04:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
certainly helps to alleviate the problem
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of the unit type and
 
04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
regardless of the location
 
04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
um it was stated before we do view this
 
04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
as a private property rights issue and I
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
do believe that there are homeowners who
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
have single family homes who
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
um have a zoning that is uh imposed on
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
them historically that I think that uh
 
04:04:03.530 --> 04:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
they would appreciate some relief from
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I think it's worth noting that a lot
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the Municipal Water and Sewer the
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
reason why we have such restrictive
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
zoning historically has been because you
 
04:04:13.920 --> 04:04:14.689 align:start position:0%
zoning historically has been because you
need

04:04:14.689 --> 04:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:04:16.969 --> 04:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
um it's a geometry problem when you go
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
to have a well radii and a septic system
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
where you don't have Municipal Water and
 
04:04:23.809 --> 04:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
Sewer you need about you know an acre
 
04:04:26.150 --> 04:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
and a half two acres to get that well
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
radii and uh and your septic system so
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
they don't overlap with one another but
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with a more uh
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
densely populated densely packed area
 
04:04:37.929 --> 04:04:37.939 align:start position:0%
where there is Municipal Water and Sewer
 
04:04:40.849 --> 04:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
this is the type of uh development that
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we want and we need
 
04:04:46.130 --> 04:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
so I think that homeowners would
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate the flexibility to decide for
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
themselves if they should be able to
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
expand and then lastly I just wanted to
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
touch upon uh one of the questions that
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
was raised relative to uh density and
 
04:05:01.250 --> 04:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
the additional
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
um uh toll perhaps was the word used on
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
our school system and I would say that
 
04:05:11.170 --> 04:05:11.180 align:start position:0%
there is a lack of correlation between
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
the student population and increasing of
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
taxes and I would also say that our
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
school population
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
if you look at the statistics over the
 
04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
last 15 years we've seen a decline of
 
04:05:28.849 --> 04:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
K-12 population of about 30 to 35
 
04:05:32.090 --> 04:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
000 students on a Statewide basis so I I
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
respect that some municipalities have a
 
04:05:36.410 --> 04:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
concern about additional students
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
entering their systems I would say that
 
04:05:44.090 --> 04:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
the um the fear perhaps of that is not
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
as strong as the reality and I
 
04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony and happy to answer
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
two minutes 48 seconds oh awesome I can
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
do better I can do better
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative manage booty thank you Mr
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
the question is you said you're a public
 
04:06:11.809 --> 04:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
policy for realtors association what is
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
the current status in our
 
04:06:17.769 --> 04:06:17.779 align:start position:0%
date in terms of available
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
residential units needed versus
 
04:06:22.500 --> 04:06:23.450 align:start position:0%
residential units needed versus
um

04:06:23.450 --> 04:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:25.729 align:start position:0%
um
shortage

04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
for the question uh on the apartment
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
rental side vacancy is under one half of
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
one percent so a rounding error if you
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
will on the single family home side we
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
would see that the current days on
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
Market which is typically measured in
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
months is now 23 days I believe it was
 
04:06:53.090 --> 04:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
in 2022 it is getting a little bit
 
04:06:55.370 --> 04:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
longer as interest rates start to climb
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
but still we would argue a balanced
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
Market you need to see 90 to 180 days to
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
be balanced in favor of both buyer and
 
04:07:03.840 --> 04:07:08.030 align:start position:0%
be balanced in favor of both buyer and
seller

04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.689 --> 04:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
um guest follow-up thank you how would
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
this impact in terms of building the
 
04:07:18.769 --> 04:07:18.779 align:start position:0%
inventory in a shorter period
 
04:07:22.729 --> 04:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh or this would take as long as any
 
04:07:25.610 --> 04:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
other large development
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the question I I
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
think that it's going to be a a small
 
04:07:33.530 --> 04:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
impact I don't Envision this is going to
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
bring 10 000 units online overnight this
 
04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
still takes time it takes financing is
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
really the most challenging aspect in
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
today's economy but I think what allows
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
again it goes to that private property
 
04:07:47.210 --> 04:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
rights where there's there's a home
 
04:07:49.729 --> 04:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
owner out there who wants to get
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
additional income perhaps from a rental
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to grow their
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
family in place it's it's not too
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
dissimilar to the Adu bill which this
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
body thought was a positive thing a
 
04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
but representative Guthrie are you
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
asking for a question yeah oh I'm sorry
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
I should have I turned on I did have a
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
question I do you believe that the
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
character of a community is determined
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
mainly by the zoning and if we change
 
04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
the zoning in any Community we're going
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
to change the character of that to me
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:08:31.500 --> 04:08:33.729 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

04:08:33.729 --> 04:08:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat related I think that when you
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
talk about the character what are we
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
talking about are we talking about the
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
number of individuals in the community
 
04:08:44.809 --> 04:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
as some other folks have testified
 
04:08:47.929 --> 04:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
before there's architecture which may or
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
may not be spelled out in
 
04:08:53.210 --> 04:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
um in in your zoning regs my father
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
always likes to say you can't regulate
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
taste right and we walk we all walk
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
around our neighborhoods and we know
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
people who uh we wish the house hadn't
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
been built but that may or may not be
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that we can we excuse me a
 
04:09:08.450 --> 04:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
planning board or zoning board currently
 
04:09:12.050 --> 04:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
regulates is the architectural design so
 
04:09:13.969 --> 04:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
when I think about character there's
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
different ways to think about it but I
 
04:09:17.769 --> 04:09:17.779 align:start position:0%
don't think increasing the number of
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
individuals living in a community uh is
 
04:09:23.150 --> 04:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
is a is a negative impact to that
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
Community follow-up Mr chairman if I
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
could go ahead do you think uh not in my
 
04:09:32.570 --> 04:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:32.580 --> 04:09:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:09:33.429 --> 04:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily representative thank you
 
04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
for the question depends what the knot
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
in my backyard is if we want another uh
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know if you wanted a a toxic waste
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
dump or something in your backyard yes I
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
can certainly respect why that why that
 
04:09:49.729 --> 04:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
would be but I I don't think that
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
um housing is something that is in a
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
knot in my backyard is a bad thing I
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
think that all of us would say that our
 
04:10:00.050 --> 04:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
communities the coffee shops that have
 
04:10:02.450 --> 04:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
been mentioned before the manufacturers
 
04:10:04.610 --> 04:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
everyone needs
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
um employment I myself work in the
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
commercial side of the real estate
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
industry and I can tell you my employers
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
who I work with they are finding it
 
04:10:16.250 --> 04:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
harder and harder to find labor and the
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
labor is driving from farther and
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
farther away and they're just not
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
interested in locating here and so
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's an imbalance is there a perfect
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
solution no but I do think that this
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
bill is is a small step in the direction
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
to solving a portion of our housing
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
crisis thank you Floyd your answer thank
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so you know other
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have one quick question
 
04:10:40.130 --> 04:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
based on the NIMBY statement um would
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
you say that the term NIMBY is
 
04:10:42.239 --> 04:10:43.610 align:start position:0%
you say that the term NIMBY is
subjective

04:10:43.610 --> 04:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
is subjective yeah
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes I believe so thank you thank you sir
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher all right so
 
04:10:53.929 --> 04:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
and kind of to follow up this line of
 
04:10:53.939 --> 04:10:55.010 align:start position:0%
and kind of to follow up this line of
questions

04:10:55.010 --> 04:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
04:11:01.250 --> 04:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the yes in my
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
backyard movement and if so would um
 
04:11:09.290 --> 04:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
you are gimby for short would you say
 
04:11:12.650 --> 04:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
this counts as a ymb bill
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:11:16.130 --> 04:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
question I've heard of the phrase I
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about the definition
 
04:11:20.150 --> 04:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I I think relative to both not and
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes in my backyard I I think the
 
04:11:24.769 --> 04:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
question is is this something that our
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
communities and I said Community overall
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a state needs and that's housing and
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
I think that the answer is yes I think
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh I'll stay away from labeling bills
 
04:11:38.809 --> 04:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh next
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to call thank you everyone
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh bright uh Bryce Cowell
 
04:11:43.800 --> 04:11:48.229 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh bright uh Bryce Cowell
thanks

04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to remind you the three
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
minutes please
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
yep good afternoon if you see a giant
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
stack of papers it's just because I
 
04:11:57.050 --> 04:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
printed out my one-page testimony uh so
 
04:11:59.090 --> 04:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
I can pass it out at the end good
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair and members of the
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Bryce cowwoo and I
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester where I'm a homeowner
 
04:12:06.050 --> 04:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
in a wonderful single-family
 
04:12:07.849 --> 04:12:07.859 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I also currently serve as
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Manchester planning
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
board although I'm here today in my
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
personal capacity my own personal
 
04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
capacity I do not represent the board or
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
the city at this time instead of diving
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
deep into planning related statistics or
 
04:12:22.610 --> 04:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
numerical arguments like some others
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
have done I want to keep things simple
 
04:12:26.809 --> 04:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
and brief and talk about freedom
 
04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
because House Bill 44
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
in its Essence is about reducing local
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
government overreach I find it rather
 
04:12:35.809 --> 04:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
ironic that so many places in the Live
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
Free or Die state currently Place such
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
stringent limitations on what private
 
04:12:41.809 --> 04:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
property owners can do in residential
 
04:12:41.819 --> 04:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
property owners can do in residential
zones

04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
zones
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
right now the city of Manchester is
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
dictating what I do with my own
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
single-family home property and
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of other Granite Staters in
 
04:12:52.490 --> 04:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
other cities and towns across New
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to deal with similar
 
04:12:56.210 --> 04:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
burdensome government regulation
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
now I fully recognize and appreciate
 
04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
that government regulation can be
 
04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
important especially when it addresses
 
04:13:04.610 --> 04:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
matters of public health and safety such
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
as preventing an industrial
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility from being built
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
right next to an established
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood or perhaps when someone as
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier wants to build a new
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
home or fourplex in an area that doesn't
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
have the requisite Municipal
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but that doesn't really
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
apply here from my vantage point using
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
your own residentially zoned property in
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
a more flexible way hurts nobody and can
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually benefit Society by providing
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
more housing more taxpayers and more
 
04:13:33.170 --> 04:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
folks to participate in the community
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
yet so many cities and towns are
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
actively stopping people from doing that
 
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
housebo 44 on the other hand doesn't
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
make anybody do anything this bill
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
expands freedom for people in our great
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
state by allowing more folks to do more
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
with their own private property so if
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
any members of this committee would like
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
to stand up in the future and claim that
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
you fight for Freedom that you defend
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
private property rights that you support
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
the free market and that you want to
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
reduce government regulation or that you
 
04:14:03.530 --> 04:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
believe and Live Free or Die if any of
 
04:14:06.170 --> 04:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
that applies to you then respectfully I
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
would suggest that you support this
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislation because that is exactly what
 
04:14:12.050 --> 04:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
hb44 does so again I wanted to keep
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
things short and sweet so that concludes
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
my planned remarks thank you for your
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
time and although I am not representing
 
04:14:19.849 --> 04:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
Manchester in an official capacity I can
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
answer questions related to our planning
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
or zoning thank you
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man chaputi
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't realize you had a eye
 
04:14:33.769 --> 04:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
on the side Mr chip
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
um currently Manchester uh like Nashua
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
has zoning ordinances and how would it
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
impact the downtown Nash sorry
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester if this passes yeah thank you
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
for your question representative I do
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
want to clarify something that was
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
stated earlier there was some emphasis
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
on downtown impacts um for towns and
 
04:15:00.290 --> 04:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
cities across the state given that
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester is a relatively large city in
 
04:15:05.809 --> 04:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
the state this impact wouldn't really be
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
felt in our downtown it would be felt
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
more in the outer portions of our city
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
because according to our current zoning
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
regulations this type of housing can be
 
04:15:16.729 --> 04:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
built by Wright in just about everywhere
 
04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
in the center of the city we do have
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of triple Deckers and other
 
04:15:23.570 --> 04:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
homes we are still missing
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
proportionally you know the middle
 
04:15:26.769 --> 04:15:26.779 align:start position:0%
missing housing
 
04:15:29.689 --> 04:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
but yeah so for example I live in the
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
North End of Manchester Ward one we are
 
04:15:35.150 --> 04:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
primarily single family whether it's
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I guess medium density or high
 
04:15:39.050 --> 04:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
density single family zoning it's still
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
single family so that's where the impact
 
04:15:42.530 --> 04:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
of this would be felt in my community
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
specifically and Manchester is going
 
04:15:46.610 --> 04:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
through a land use code update process
 
04:15:48.650 --> 04:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
that has been taking a little longer
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
than expected we don't have anything
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
public yet
 
04:15:54.410 --> 04:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
um but I guess from my testimony you can
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
tell where I will fall when we do
 
04:15:58.370 --> 04:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
discuss this publicly as a board later
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
this year thank you
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
So In Your Capacity as a professional
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
planner would you think that this bill
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
would fit more appropriately in cities
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
or towns of a certain size
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and I I do
 
04:16:18.290 --> 04:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
agree in part um I do think that it's
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that uh any sort
 
04:16:20.880 --> 04:16:21.889 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that uh any sort
of

04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:16:24.170 --> 04:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
new development really fits the context
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
of the community to a certain degree I
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
think this bill adequately does take
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
that into account by making sure that it
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
only applies to lots that already have
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer and there has
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
been discussion about you know the
 
04:16:38.150 --> 04:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
adequate capacity of that but I do think
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
the town uh or city if it has concerns
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
with existing capacity of its um sewer
 
04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
or water supply that could come into the
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
conversation there but I think this bill
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
is tailored in a way that does address
 
04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.290 --> 04:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
go ahead turn your mic on
 
04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
so with with what's been said about this
 
04:17:03.410 --> 04:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh water or sewer hookups a lot of uh
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
towns have sewer lines that extend it
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
out to developments that would go by
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
areas that aren't developed now so do
 
04:17:15.130 --> 04:17:15.140 align:start position:0%
you think as a planner that this
 
04:17:17.570 --> 04:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
ruling would cover
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
those uh lots that that sewer line had
 
04:17:24.530 --> 04:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
been specifically designed for
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great question my understanding
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
or at least my perception of this
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed legislation would
 
04:17:32.450 --> 04:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
be that
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
um usually infrastructure runs you know
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
maybe under the street and if the
 
04:17:38.570 --> 04:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
property abuts that Street then I think
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
that it would be technically serviced by
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
it and I do also want to suggest that if
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh are concerned about
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
the cost uh you know the added cost of
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining or building new
 
04:17:51.290 --> 04:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for water or sewer
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
related to more development there are
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
impact fees that are specifically
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
enabled by the state of New Hampshire
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'd have to double check to make sure it
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
applies to sewer and water but I'm
 
04:18:02.090 --> 04:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it does I know it applies in
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester we use it for school impact
 
04:18:09.790 --> 04:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
fees and also for fire impact fees
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
response yeah
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
one quick question and seeing no more um
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
did you say you're a homeowner in
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester I am yes uh I was very
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
fortunate and got in before the market
 
04:18:22.370 --> 04:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
went crazy in 2018. okay
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
um the other quick question question uh
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the words free will
 
04:18:25.859 --> 04:18:27.469 align:start position:0%

04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
which I am totally in agreement with you
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
on so my question would be as a
 
04:18:34.250 --> 04:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
purchaser for a home in New in North End
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%

all right thank you very much thank you
 
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Lisa Stone and
 
04:19:04.010 --> 04:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the planning board in
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
Peterborough I'm also a realtor I am
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
here of my own free will
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
um not speaking for either
 
04:19:11.520 --> 04:19:12.650 align:start position:0%
um not speaking for either
um

04:19:12.650 --> 04:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
earlier we heard a mention of character
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
and I would like to say that the people
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
who live in downtown Manchester this
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
week are seeing the character of
 
04:19:23.220 --> 04:19:24.410 align:start position:0%
week are seeing the character of
homelessness

04:19:24.410 --> 04:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
04:19:27.769 --> 04:19:27.779 align:start position:0%
we have a huge housing crisis
 
04:19:31.250 --> 04:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
and for most of the little towns in our
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
state this bill probably creates one or
 
04:19:37.130 --> 04:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
two units right if you own a single
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
family home you're not I'm I own a big
 
04:19:39.420 --> 04:19:40.790 align:start position:0%
family home you're not I'm I own a big
house

04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
full of my current family I'm not going
 
04:19:45.769 --> 04:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
to run out and divide my house up next
 
04:19:48.650 --> 04:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
week but when I turn 70 I might and I
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to do that and
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
to stay home and I I just think that
 
04:19:59.450 --> 04:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
when people get all wound up about the
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
character of their neighborhood uh
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
having people not be homeless in our
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
state which is a real reality that I
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
don't think that we've ever seen before
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
like we are seeing it now and it's
 
04:20:13.250 --> 04:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough housing
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
over and over and over you know
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
um currently as a realtor I can tell you
 
04:20:21.050 --> 04:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
that there are 1100 houses on the market
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
in the entire State the average house
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
price being 450 but 800 of the houses
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
that are currently on the market are
 
04:20:33.050 --> 04:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
over 450 450
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
000 so they're really we are so missing
 
04:20:41.469 --> 04:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.969 --> 04:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions we'll call next uh
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.050 --> 04:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Nick Taylor I'm the
 
04:21:01.849 --> 04:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
executive director of the workforce
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition of the greater
 
04:21:05.809 --> 04:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
Seacoast I'll also be presenting as uh
 
04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
for Alyssa margolin with housing action
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a member of the
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
governing Council of uh housing action
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we'll get a two for one
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
within three minutes here
 
04:21:18.170 --> 04:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
um we are here in both cases in strong
 
04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 44 for many of the
 
04:21:23.330 --> 04:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
reasons that were laid out already we're
 
04:21:25.010 --> 04:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
hearing from businesses all across the
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
Seacoast that they're in desperate need
 
04:21:28.490 --> 04:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
of workers they can't find them and the
 
04:21:29.689 --> 04:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
employees that they do have are
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
continuing to leave because the commutes
 
04:21:33.170 --> 04:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
are long the rents are increasing and
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
housing is becoming increasingly
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
unaffordable I think it's really clear
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire that we need to
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
increase the supply of all types of
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
housing that includes everything from
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
more single-family homes to more larger
 
04:21:47.330 --> 04:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
multi-family homes and everything in the
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
middle like this bill does
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the main point that I just
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to hammer home here is
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
as policy makers when you're increasing
 
04:21:57.410 --> 04:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
Supply one of the main Tools in your
 
04:21:59.689 --> 04:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
toolbox is to relax regulations and
 
04:22:02.210 --> 04:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
allow for more freedom of people to
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
develop their property as they see fit
 
04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
within reason and this is one of the
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
things that this bill does it would
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
allow for naturally occurring market
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
rate housing that is also generally more
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
affordable to our attainable for our
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce in a way that you know there's
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
no increased government funding here
 
04:22:20.450 --> 04:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
there's no increased subsidies or
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's naturally
 
04:22:23.689 --> 04:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
occurring market rate housing that will
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
inherently be more attainable to our
 
04:22:27.530 --> 04:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is an incredible
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this Committee in this
 
04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
body here and under this bill as
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have mentioned
 
04:22:35.929 --> 04:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
communities maintain their ability to
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
regulate appearance and architecture
 
04:22:39.250 --> 04:22:39.260 align:start position:0%
while still increasing housing Supply
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
which is very important I also have a
 
04:22:44.330 --> 04:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
letter that I will hand out on behalf of
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire and then
 
04:22:49.130 --> 04:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
two quick events that housing New
 
04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing action New Hampshire
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
is hosting on Monday the 23rd at 4 pm
 
04:22:57.050 --> 04:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
this is a virtual webinar the former
 
04:22:58.250 --> 04:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House in Maine Ryan
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
fechtow and a Republican mayor Jason
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
Levick our presenting Maine had just
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
passed a very similar Bill and then on
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
January 26th the bipartisan housing
 
04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
caucus is hosting legislative luncheon
 
04:23:12.530 --> 04:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the State House cafeteria we'll also
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow up an email with that
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think I got it 155 very nice I would
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
advise though in the future that you
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
keep your testimony to the specific
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
build and not do any advertising sure
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh Guthrie thank you
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
just a guy I wanted to talk to
 
04:23:35.929 --> 04:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
has there been any consideration in
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
having employers provide housing like we
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
did back in the day
 
04:23:44.450 --> 04:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
so we hear from a lot of employers who
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
are interested in providing housing
 
04:23:49.250 --> 04:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
frequently local regulations uh whether
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's density whether it's availability
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
of land are actually stopping
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that from going forward and you also
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
have employers who you know are if
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
they're in the manufacturing business
 
04:24:00.650 --> 04:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
they really don't want to be in the
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
landlord business and they don't want to
 
04:24:04.610 --> 04:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
be managing the rent and the salary and
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for letting go on
 
04:24:13.729 --> 04:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
our subjects thank you
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative Charlotte
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
once again thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Taylor for coming in I have two
 
04:24:21.889 --> 04:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
questions for you
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
um how long has your organization been
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
04:24:28.490 --> 04:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
we've been around since 2001 originally

Brown

04:25:29.210 --> 04:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
just a quick question you said Maine
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
just recently passed a bill I know this
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire but you said that it's
 
04:25:37.130 --> 04:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
a significantly the same as this bill
 
04:25:40.610 --> 04:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how it differs
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
um it was part of a larger package I
 
04:25:44.349 --> 04:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
believe uh LD
 
04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
2003 was their bill there was a few
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
other pieces to it but the the
 
04:25:51.170 --> 04:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
fundamental piece of the four units with
 
04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
water and sewer was the same
 
04:25:56.330 --> 04:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.250 --> 04:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony final
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
pink card I have I'm assuming there are
 
04:26:06.050 --> 04:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.060 --> 04:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.250 --> 04:26:15.260 align:start position:0%
you turn on your microphone there please
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Jane Hague I live at on
 
04:26:21.410 --> 04:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
Union Street in Manchester and I really
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
um since I don't really have a whole lot
 
04:26:28.849 --> 04:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
to add I support this bill
 
04:26:31.370 --> 04:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh like Bryce I'm a homeowner in the
 
04:26:33.769 --> 04:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
North End of Manchester I live in an
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
interesting old old farmhouse that
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually used to be a duplex but I think
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
is now Zone single family so certainly
 
04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
this would give us the opportunity to
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
convert it back into a duplex by right
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
which I think would be good but I
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
actually belong to the Manchester
 
04:26:51.170 --> 04:26:51.180 align:start position:0%
housing Alliance we're a volunteer group
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
of people who have been trying to work
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
on solving some of the housing problems
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
in Manchester which actually have only
 
04:26:59.929 --> 04:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
gotten worse over the last two years and
 
04:26:59.939 --> 04:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
gotten worse over the last two years and
um

04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
so um I just want to say that I think
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
that this is really important we have we
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
have a housing crisis in New Hampshire I
 
04:27:10.010 --> 04:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
hope everyone is finally convinced of
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
that this isn't going to solve the
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in Manchester but I think
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
we need to take the opportunity to pass
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
as many things as we can that will
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
actually help and I think this is one of
 
04:27:25.130 --> 04:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
the things that could do that as part of
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
my volunteer job here with the housing
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
Alliance I try to attend as many of
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
these events and do as much reading on
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the subject so I attended an event with
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
published a paper on how to increase
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
housing affordability by understanding
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
deterrence local deterrence to building
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing and they um their
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
main point was an important way to
 
04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
ensure low rents and lower housing
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
prices and to increase the supply
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
which is difficult in these land
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
constrained metropolitan areas unless we
 
04:28:04.130 --> 04:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
take up the opportunity to build more
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
dense housing I think Manchester is an
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
interesting because people talk about
 
04:28:10.490 --> 04:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
the missing middle housing the three
 
04:28:12.410 --> 04:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
plexes and the four plexes and eight
 
04:28:15.769 --> 04:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
plexes and that is what Manchester is in
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
the center part of the city there's so
 
04:28:20.809 --> 04:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
many of these old Victorian houses that
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
an adjacent or added on unit with maybe
 
04:28:26.809 --> 04:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
another four or five units so you're
 
04:28:28.849 --> 04:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
getting like eight units I don't think
 
04:28:31.130 --> 04:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to see that but I also agree
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
with the previous speaker who said this
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
isn't going to immediately change the
 
04:28:36.530 --> 04:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
character of every neighborhood in
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester that has water and sewer
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to jump in and start
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
doing this wholesale I don't think it's
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to change anything for a couple
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
years actually so
 
04:28:47.580 --> 04:28:48.110 align:start position:0%
years actually so
um

04:28:48.110 --> 04:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can begin to adopt this
 
04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
and other other ordinances like the Adu
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
bills and so forth
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
and incentivize cities to actually add
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer that's all I
 
04:29:03.530 --> 04:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%

04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%

blue sheet there were 10 signed in for
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
it none against and with that I will
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB 44 and with that
 
04:29:28.429 --> 04:29:28.439 align:start position:0%

um uh for the reading of the blue shade
 
04:30:05.090 --> 04:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
numbers there I couldn't quite tell if
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%

honorable Municipal and County
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
government Community for hearing my
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
argument for this bill today it's a
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
relatively simple bill and it's in it's
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
in an existing law that is full of maids
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
but no shells
 
04:31:12.050 --> 04:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh and so it is
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
the these are suggestions and guidelines
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
if you will for communities who are who
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
have planning boards and it is the duty
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
of the planning board to develop a
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
master planning process every five to
 
04:31:26.210 --> 04:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
ten years
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh in um in our city of Lebanon
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
we recently had
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
a debate between the planning board and
 
04:31:38.110 --> 04:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
the City Council on whether to require
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
new development to ins to install uh EV
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
charging stations as a part of their
 
04:31:46.080 --> 04:31:48.349 align:start position:0%
charging stations as a part of their
infrastructure

04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:31:50.210 --> 04:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
um members of the planning board felt
 
04:31:51.729 --> 04:31:51.739 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
constituted an undue burden on
 
04:31:56.450 --> 04:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
developers members of the city council
 
04:31:56.460 --> 04:31:58.250 align:start position:0%
developers members of the city council
disagreed

04:31:58.250 --> 04:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
disagreed
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
um if my bill is adopted going forward
 
04:32:02.330 --> 04:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
that kind of argument won't take place
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
anymore but it just it adds to the
 
04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
chapter on Master plans some language
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
that brings Master planning into the
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
20th maybe even the 21st century
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh and so my my suggestions which come
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
forward with the support of the Lebanon
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
04:32:27.530 --> 04:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh have in them the inclusion of
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
chapters on the following
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
a transition to renewable energy section
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is in the municipal master plan so
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's just a suggestion it's not a shell
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's a May
 
04:32:42.410 --> 04:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
which includes an analysis of citizens
 
04:32:44.570 --> 04:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
needs for alternative sources of energy
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
such as EV charging stations enhanced
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
bike Lanes Community power generation
 
04:32:52.849 --> 04:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
which this general court has already
 
04:32:52.859 --> 04:32:54.410 align:start position:0%
which this general court has already
approved

04:32:54.410 --> 04:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
approved
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and incorporation of solar and wind
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
power into the area under the
 
04:33:01.370 --> 04:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the planning board
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
and it also adds at the end any other
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
section addressing any other topic
 
04:33:07.970 --> 04:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
relevant to the appropriate future
 
04:33:10.490 --> 04:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
development of the area under the
 
04:33:12.890 --> 04:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the planning board that
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
are not specifically enumerated in this
 
04:33:18.051 --> 04:33:18.061 align:start position:0%
section so as I said it's a simple bill
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
it just lets planning boards and
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
municipalities be a little bit more
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
forward-looking in the way that they
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
develop their Municipal Master plans and
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully to anticipate some of the
 
04:33:32.689 --> 04:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
changes that have already come down the
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
line and will undoubtedly be coming down
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
the line in the near future and I'm
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:33:40.810 --> 04:33:40.820 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative treleman
 
04:33:45.890 --> 04:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you once again Mr chair and thank
 
04:33:47.330 --> 04:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
question am I to assume you're
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
introducing this as a bill
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
I am oh I didn't hear those words come
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
out of your mouth so sorry I want to
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
just a quick question thank you Mr
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there was a debate
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
between the planning board and the city
 
04:34:14.330 --> 04:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
council regarding charging stations so
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
leads me into was the debate and I'll
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
get to the reason for this in just a
 
04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
minute was the reason for the debate
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
in a development plan they were going to
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
require charging stations by a private
 
04:34:27.240 --> 04:34:28.369 align:start position:0%
require charging stations by a private
developer

04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
developer
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
or private property owner or was it
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
something that the town was going to do
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
this would have been something that the
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
city would have required of private
 
04:34:41.929 --> 04:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
developers when proposing new buildings
 
04:34:45.410 --> 04:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
that they incorporate EV charging
 
04:34:47.929 --> 04:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
infrastructure into their plans
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
well Mr Sharon follow-up so in regard to
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
this so I'm trying to understand the
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
undue burden discussion as related to
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
that and how
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
and how we transition to this bill from
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
that how that how that works that's an
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
excellent question and thank you for
 
04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
asking it
 
04:35:08.340 --> 04:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
asking it
um

04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:13.369 --> 04:35:13.379 align:start position:0%
my contention is that by incorporating
 
04:35:16.631 --> 04:35:16.641 align:start position:0%
into the master planning process some
 
04:35:19.209 --> 04:35:19.219 align:start position:0%
forward-thinking language that might
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
induce towns and cities to look forward
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
and incorporate some of those issues
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
like EV charging infrastructure into
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
their Municipal Master plans the debates
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
such as the one that we had in Lebanon
 
04:35:40.849 --> 04:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just uh
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
alerting that I am one of the
 
04:35:50.631 --> 04:35:50.641 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors so but I'm not testifying
 
04:35:52.910 --> 04:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
there so I'm sitting and asking the
 
04:35:52.920 --> 04:35:54.590 align:start position:0%
there so I'm sitting and asking the
question

04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:35:56.631 --> 04:35:56.641 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for taking
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
the question and bringing this bill
 
04:36:02.449 --> 04:36:02.459 align:start position:0%
forward how would this relate to
 
04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of Net Zero development
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
where any new development
 
04:36:12.250 --> 04:36:12.260 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
04:36:15.051 --> 04:36:15.061 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining in terms of energy which
 
04:36:17.529 --> 04:36:17.539 align:start position:0%
includes renewable passive building
 
04:36:22.010 --> 04:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
charging and all that so
 
04:36:22.020 --> 04:36:23.449 align:start position:0%
charging and all that so
this

04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:36:28.369 --> 04:36:28.379 align:start position:0%
would this enable such a new development
 
04:36:32.570 --> 04:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
so it's not impacting the existing grid
 
04:36:34.490 --> 04:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
04:36:36.590 --> 04:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
um no it wouldn't it simply enables the
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
it enlarges the scope of what the
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
municipal planning board can think about
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
when beginning to draft a master plan
 
04:36:54.051 --> 04:36:54.061 align:start position:0%
when renewing an existing master plan it
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
would it would not as I said before it
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any shells in it it's all
 
04:36:57.480 --> 04:36:58.330 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any shells in it it's all
may

04:36:58.330 --> 04:36:58.340 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
it just allows for a larger area of
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
thinking for for municipal planners to
 
04:37:08.449 --> 04:37:08.459 align:start position:0%
Envision the future as opposed to Simply
 
04:37:12.890 --> 04:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up go ahead thank you
 
04:37:20.029 --> 04:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
um absolutely I I hear it it may and
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's the master plan what I'm alluding
 
04:37:25.010 --> 04:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
to is there are some communities that
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
are requiring for the master plan any
 
04:37:31.010 --> 04:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
new development has to be Net Zero
 
04:37:33.250 --> 04:37:33.260 align:start position:0%
that's helping
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
that not have the debate in the
 
04:37:38.631 --> 04:37:38.641 align:start position:0%
community between the zoning or planning
 
04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
board and the municipality thank you
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi I I'm not
 
04:37:46.970 --> 04:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
familiar with those particular Municipal
 
04:37:50.529 --> 04:37:50.539 align:start position:0%
Master plans my understanding of this
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
RSA is that the municipal Master
 
04:37:56.330 --> 04:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
planning process is a planning board
 
04:37:56.340 --> 04:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
planning process is a planning board
tool

04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
tool
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
to help guide the planning board and the
 
04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
municipality in the future use of the
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that it oversees
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh any subsequent requirements or zoning
 
04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
changes or mandates would come from the
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
governing body and not the planning
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
board that is responsible for developing
 
04:38:23.529 --> 04:38:23.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple for you
 
04:38:28.500 --> 04:38:30.650 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple for you
representative

04:38:30.650 --> 04:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:32.929 --> 04:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned at the very beginning
 
04:38:36.051 --> 04:38:36.061 align:start position:0%
um that the RSA 642-2
 
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
it indeed does start with a May and then
 
04:38:41.929 --> 04:38:41.939 align:start position:0%
it goes into this long laundry list of
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
issues you you stated that you believe
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
and what I was considering is it a
 
04:38:56.699 --> 04:38:58.369 align:start position:0%
and what I was considering is it a
possibility

04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
04:39:01.250 --> 04:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
that that make could also be interpreted
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
a town
 
04:39:09.600 --> 04:39:10.970 align:start position:0%
a town
May

04:39:10.970 --> 04:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
May
 
04:39:13.849 --> 04:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
only look at these items
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
04:39:18.890 --> 04:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
may you may consider these items which
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
one of those do you see it as
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
I know it might sound like it's a fine
 
04:39:25.849 --> 04:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
line but to me there's a very big
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
difference between a suggestive or a
 
04:39:29.810 --> 04:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
restrictive word man sounds like a
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
philosophical conundrum actually it
 
04:39:38.350 --> 04:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.850 --> 04:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
interpretation and I'm just asking for
 
04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
your interpretation of that I see it as
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
as more of a
 
04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
a suggestion as as opposed to a
 
04:39:51.530 --> 04:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
requirement and I will just point to the
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
um to lines 9 through 11.
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the proposed bill which in fact
 
04:40:00.410 --> 04:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
basically says anything else
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.958 --> 04:40:05.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think I have to ask Sarah right now
 
04:40:13.080 --> 04:40:13.730 align:start position:0%
I think I have to ask Sarah right now
um

04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:16.570 --> 04:40:16.580 align:start position:0%
do I have to accept it
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
the the follow-up would be if indeed it
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
is suggestive which
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
I also would tend to agree with you is
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that
 
04:40:31.570 --> 04:40:31.580 align:start position:0%
everything after
 
04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
642-2 at the top where it says may all
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
that laundry list of items I mean that
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
laundry list couldn't that laundry list
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
continue on and on and on or
 
04:40:46.010 --> 04:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
simply have
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
something similar to what you have
 
04:40:47.700 --> 04:40:49.490 align:start position:0%
something similar to what you have
written

04:40:49.490 --> 04:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.490 --> 04:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
it could
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question I am not
 
04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the history of
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
this piece of the RSA I do know that
 
04:41:10.910 --> 04:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
in my tenure on the planning board in
 
04:41:10.920 --> 04:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
in my tenure on the planning board in
Lebanon

04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
that list that is enumerated in the RSA
 
04:41:19.368 --> 04:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
has become very important and extremely
 
04:41:22.850 --> 04:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
helpful not so much as a prescriptive or
 
04:41:25.970 --> 04:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
proscriptive list but as a list of
 
04:41:28.368 --> 04:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
suggested guidelines
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm answering your
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
question I don't think I am
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying I'm really trying I
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
understand how you have responded thank
 
04:41:37.320 --> 04:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
understand how you have responded thank
you

04:41:38.750 --> 04:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative priest yeah yes thank you
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question and
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that with the master plans
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:41:54.288 --> 04:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
every Community is different unique and
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
these suggestions that are given
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the rsas are suggestions to help the
 
04:42:02.750 --> 04:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
planners to think about
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
how to move their community
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
forward in the future
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.690 --> 04:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Edward
 
04:42:19.730 --> 04:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:42:19.740 --> 04:42:20.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
would you agree that may is
 
04:42:23.760 --> 04:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
would you agree that may is
discretionary

04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
04:42:31.060 --> 04:42:31.070 align:start position:0%
if the communities
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
if the communities
[Music]

04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:42:33.600 --> 04:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgot my train of thought
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.448 --> 04:42:49.458 align:start position:0%
no follow-up
 
04:42:51.770 --> 04:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
representing bro
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh just another quick question so uh to
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
implement this it says 60 days after
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
passage nothing really has to be done it
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
just changes the RSA and was as
 
04:43:04.850 --> 04:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
communities refer to the irsa as moving
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward they just look at this to help
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
them enable them to look at other ideas
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct thank you
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for taking
 
04:43:22.368 --> 04:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
um would you just characterize this as
 
04:43:26.570 --> 04:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
an enabling
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh legislation for
 
04:43:33.530 --> 04:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
future or current or future Master
 
04:43:33.540 --> 04:43:38.208 align:start position:0%
future or current or future Master
planning

04:43:38.208 --> 04:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know how to answer that
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
question representative man japoodi my
 
04:43:42.600 --> 04:43:44.510 align:start position:0%
question representative man japoodi my
understanding

04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me of this RSA
 
04:43:50.330 --> 04:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
on developing Municipal Master plans
 
04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
is that it specifies that it shall be
 
04:43:56.270 --> 04:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
the duty of the planning board to do
 
04:43:56.280 --> 04:43:57.050 align:start position:0%
the duty of the planning board to do
this

04:43:57.050 --> 04:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it is not prescriptive or
 
04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
prescriptive I'm sorry getting those two
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
words mixed up
 
04:44:07.368 --> 04:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
it is not an absolute must have for
 
04:44:09.890 --> 04:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
every municipality that the RSA does not
 
04:44:12.770 --> 04:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
dictate that so
 
04:44:16.490 --> 04:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that it's enabling I
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
believe that it's just
 
04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
a part of the duties of of town
 
04:44:20.820 --> 04:44:23.690 align:start position:0%
a part of the duties of of town
departments

04:44:23.690 --> 04:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.700 --> 04:44:29.208 align:start position:0%
 
Statewide

04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie just a quick
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
dude thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:44:38.930 --> 04:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you know of
 
04:44:43.810 --> 04:44:43.820 align:start position:0%
communities to just take their planning
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
information just put it in a draw
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's no action required by that alas
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
I do yes as as I do thank you thanks for
 
04:44:58.490 --> 04:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony seeing no more questions
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Davis call
 
04:45:02.810 --> 04:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh Nature's Grace
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.128 --> 04:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
the committee Nate Grace for the
 
04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
municipal Association again we support
 
04:45:16.490 --> 04:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
this bill it's expansion of the optional
 
04:45:19.128 --> 04:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
section of the master planning sheet and
 
04:45:21.650 --> 04:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
I think that your chair got exactly to
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh an an interesting point
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um which is there there's a number of
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
things that the planning board must
 
04:45:28.260 --> 04:45:29.330 align:start position:0%
things that the planning board must
consider

04:45:29.330 --> 04:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:45:31.128 --> 04:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
when creating a Master Plan and there's
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
a number of things they may consider
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
this would expand the May section
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're in favor of that but
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
as in terms of whether that may is
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
restrictive or not
 
04:45:42.780 --> 04:45:43.490 align:start position:0%
restrictive or not
um

04:45:43.490 --> 04:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
fortunately all the land use people have
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
left so I will say that my
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
interpretation is it probably is
 
04:45:52.610 --> 04:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
restrictive but if we were to enact this
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 11 would allow them to
 
04:45:56.570 --> 04:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
create whatever section is most
 
04:45:59.090 --> 04:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their Town regardless of
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
what's listed above they could create
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
something else that's not listed above
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
if that's necessary so I think this is a
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.128 --> 04:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester thank you Mr
 
04:46:17.208 --> 04:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Grace for uh taking
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
my question my question is the same one
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
that I asked the prime sponsor about
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
would this lend itself to a new
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
development in a master plan for
 
04:46:33.368 --> 04:46:33.378 align:start position:0%
communities to think about energy
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
everything inclusive environmental
 
04:46:40.970 --> 04:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
friendly needs of 21st century would
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
this enable such a community to be
 
04:46:43.620 --> 04:46:45.050 align:start position:0%
this enable such a community to be
planned

04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
planned
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
at this time yes it would enable
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
specifically because lines nine through
 
04:46:53.448 --> 04:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
11 are there
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
anything it doesn't matter really what
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
the giant list is because as long as
 
04:47:00.410 --> 04:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
your planning board thinks this is
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to your community they can add
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
a section into the master plan about

that
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
so it could be that could be something
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
completely opposite of that doesn't
 
04:47:08.520 --> 04:47:11.570 align:start position:0%
completely opposite of that doesn't
matter

04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.490 --> 04:47:13.500 align:start position:0%

okay

04:49:08.208 --> 04:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:53.690 --> 04:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.390 --> 04:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
I understand been having been in your
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
spot before I understand the problem
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay house bill 184.
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
would allow municipalities to post
 
04:50:13.910 --> 04:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
public notice for Zoning Board of
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment hearings on a town website
 
04:50:20.090 --> 04:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
if the town if there's if the website is
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
available instead of newspaper
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
publication now
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
This sounds too good to be true
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
it saves our constituents money it saves
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
our towns and cities money and it makes
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
life easier for Town employees
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
first as at the risk of repeating what
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
you already know many municipalities
 
04:50:44.570 --> 04:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
have zoning ordinance
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh commensurate with that they have a
 
04:50:49.250 --> 04:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
zoning Board of adjustment to hear an
 
04:50:49.260 --> 04:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
zoning Board of adjustment to hear an

appeals
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
on the strict application of an
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance which called variances or
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
appeal to the interpretation of an
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance by enforcement of officials to
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
a specific situation according to the
 
04:51:02.878 --> 04:51:03.788 align:start position:0%
a specific situation according to the
current

04:51:03.788 --> 04:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:51:08.770 --> 04:51:08.780 align:start position:0%
RSA section 7 6 7 6
 
04:51:11.570 --> 04:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
colon seven a public hearing and a
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%

to be notified by verified mail that's
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
section A
 
04:51:22.330 --> 04:51:22.340 align:start position:0%
of the of the law

in the
 
04:51:27.650 --> 04:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
in what I passed out and I didn't give
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
myself a copy uh is the
 
04:51:33.890 --> 04:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
copy of uh
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh six seven six
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh subsection
 
04:51:46.730 --> 04:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh subsection seven uh
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
the we were not touching that subsection
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
that could that concerns a a Butters
 
04:51:56.570 --> 04:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
notified by verified mail we're not
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
touching that
 
04:51:59.930 --> 04:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
section B
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
is on newspapers
 
04:52:05.090 --> 04:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
we're only adding additional good
 
04:52:08.650 --> 04:52:08.660 align:start position:0%
practices the new section section c
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
publication on municipalities website uh
 
04:52:14.990 --> 04:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is the big hitter
 
04:52:19.610 --> 04:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's uh it allows uh it's cheaper
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
just publish it on the website rather
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
than publish it publish uh in a
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
newspaper uh it saves the cost of the
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
newspaper space which has been
 
04:52:32.890 --> 04:52:32.900 align:start position:0%
eventually which has to be eventually
 
04:52:35.570 --> 04:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
charged to the applicants
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
processing is easier no invoices from
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
the from a publisher no clerical work or
 
04:52:44.930 --> 04:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
less clerical work and it's more
 
04:52:44.940 --> 04:52:48.350 align:start position:0%
less clerical work and it's more
effective

04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.360 --> 04:52:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:52:49.610 --> 04:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
no there's the notice is up longer
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%

04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know it should be approximate and
 
04:58:59.208 --> 04:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
that's on the latter part portion of
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%

04:59:22.490 --> 04:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
packet
 
04:59:26.570 --> 04:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
there is a a
 
04:59:34.368 --> 04:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
chapter there's there's
 
04:59:34.378 --> 04:59:36.708 align:start position:0%
chapter there's there's
two

04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
exist that there are two existing laws
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
the one that we're talking with is is is
 
04:59:44.160 --> 04:59:47.990 align:start position:0%
the one that we're talking with is is is
676

04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
colon seven if you look at
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.930 --> 04:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
colon seven
 
05:00:03.770 --> 05:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
these are requirements that for for the
 
05:00:05.628 --> 05:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
zone for the planning
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh board
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if you'll notice that if there's a
 
05:00:13.970 --> 05:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
little uh bracket
 
05:00:15.610 --> 05:00:15.620 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
05:00:21.310 --> 05:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh suggestions appear over up here in
 
05:00:25.368 --> 05:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
in that section so these these
 
05:00:25.378 --> 05:00:26.628 align:start position:0%
in that section so these these
additional

05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
cleanups or these improvements are
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
show a show that are already exists now
 
05:00:37.610 --> 05:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
in another part of the uh of the of the
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
law uh
 
05:00:43.970 --> 05:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
05:00:48.718 --> 05:00:50.208 align:start position:0%
uh no
uh

05:00:50.208 --> 05:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:55.010 --> 05:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
I also noticed that this bill is FN
 
05:00:58.368 --> 05:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
but it's but in the docket is not an
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
early bill
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah it it could go on on consent
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it because it is due on March in in
 
05:01:07.920 --> 05:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
and it because it is due on March in in
March

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
March
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
um in closing uh I'd like to
 
05:01:15.890 --> 05:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh note that this bill was initiated by
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Hudson zoning and code
 
05:01:21.050 --> 05:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer Bruce buttrick
 
05:01:24.890 --> 05:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh he's speaking soon he sought me out
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
I guess it's the best way to improve a
 
05:01:29.090 --> 05:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
system is to listen to the people who
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
live and work with it uh so regardless
 
05:01:34.610 --> 05:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
of where the bill goes I commend him for
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
may find this now in the on the in the
 
05:02:03.530 --> 05:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
major in the initial bill or in the uh
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh yes it's on line six and it says the
 
05:02:11.090 --> 05:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
notice required under this section shall
 
05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
not include the day notice is posted or
 
05:02:18.288 --> 05:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
the day of the public hearing the day of
 
05:02:19.850 --> 05:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
the public hearing is where I'm having
 
05:02:19.860 --> 05:02:21.230 align:start position:0%
the public hearing is where I'm having
confusion

05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
and of course with the public notice you
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
would have the day where the public
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
notice is going to be held is that
 
05:02:28.138 --> 05:02:29.330 align:start position:0%
notice is going to be held is that
correct

05:02:29.330 --> 05:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
right so that's why I'm confused yeah
 
05:02:33.810 --> 05:02:33.820 align:start position:0%
and maybe well in other words
 
05:02:33.820 --> 05:02:37.010 align:start position:0%
and maybe well in other words
[Music]

05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
um let's not have a back and forth if we
 
05:02:40.810 --> 05:02:40.820 align:start position:0%
have further questions
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
do you have another question I have no
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
more questions thank you
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:02:49.850 --> 05:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question
 
05:02:55.730 --> 05:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
um pertains to section c of the bill and
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
that would be line 16 through 19.
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
um alternatively to the the notice being
 
05:03:09.050 --> 05:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
posted and that the alternate
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
being posted on an internet website so
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
my question is do you need to specify
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
that such a notice will be posted
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
electronically do you need a five-day
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
specification as is
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
noted in section B
 
05:03:30.060 --> 05:03:33.230 align:start position:0%
noted in section B
uh

05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:33.240 --> 05:03:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
which

05:03:35.690 --> 05:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's I think part of the
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
all right you mean the part that was the
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
existing portion uh of uh the bill and
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
what what line in section B okay so I I
 
05:03:57.890 --> 05:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
had said that my question pertains to
 
05:04:01.550 --> 05:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
section c of the bill right and I had
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
also noted lines 16 through 19 15 right
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's section c so I was questioning is
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
a specification of
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
um five days before the date
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
of the hearing does that need to be also
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
stated in section c as it's stated in
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
section b or
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
does that five-day reference is that
 
05:04:34.368 --> 05:04:34.378 align:start position:0%

follow up thank you Mr chairman I
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
apologize I I was in another committee
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill so I I was an error I
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
I was referring the original bill when I
 
05:05:28.010 --> 05:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
should have been speaking about the
 
05:05:32.448 --> 05:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
amendment so my question still stands I
 
05:05:32.458 --> 05:05:34.368 align:start position:0%
amendment so my question still stands I
just

05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:05:34.378 --> 05:05:38.448 align:start position:0%
just
foreign

05:05:38.448 --> 05:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.090 --> 05:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just it's the reference to the five
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
days so with regards to the amendment on
 
05:05:46.970 --> 05:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
line five you specify a five-day
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm just asking if a similar
 
05:05:53.090 --> 05:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
five-day requirement needs to also be
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
specified in section c of your Amendment
 
05:05:59.570 --> 05:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
and that would somewhere within lines 9
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
through 13.
 
05:06:03.170 --> 05:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
oh I can't understand what you're saying
 
05:06:06.170 --> 05:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
the uh all right so the yeah that five
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that that talks about the here okay
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
hearing the appeal
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%

read it is in lieu of publication
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%

uh it's a you know it refers back to
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%

Brown

05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:09:16.490 --> 05:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess I just want
 
05:09:18.288 --> 05:09:18.298 align:start position:0%
to get this clarified with the line
 
05:09:20.208 --> 05:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
numbers because in the initial bill you
 
05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
have lines one through
 
05:09:24.530 --> 05:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
25 and then you introduced Amendment
 
05:09:28.730 --> 05:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
with lines 1 through 13. yeah and then
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have lines from the original Bill 13
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
through 25. so you're saying that the
 
05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
the entire bill down to line 19 is that
 
05:09:40.500 --> 05:09:42.050 align:start position:0%
the entire bill down to line 19 is that
correct

05:09:42.050 --> 05:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:09:45.530 --> 05:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh no the amendment
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
it says it it replaces the section
 
05:09:50.218 --> 05:09:51.410 align:start position:0%
it says it it replaces the section
from

05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:09:54.010 --> 05:09:54.020 align:start position:0%
it replaces
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
part of it replaces B
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
a small small B and part of of C
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes I know I had that argument
 
05:10:12.610 --> 05:10:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
could you turn off your mics please
 
05:10:14.520 --> 05:10:16.970 align:start position:0%
could you turn off your mics please
sorry

05:10:16.970 --> 05:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:10:16.980 --> 05:10:18.650 align:start position:0%
sorry
okay

05:10:18.650 --> 05:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:21.650 --> 05:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
um so looking at this amendment there's
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
multiple problems with it so section so
 
05:10:28.010 --> 05:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
you're replacing section one of the bill
 
05:10:31.250 --> 05:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
um section one starts on line one and
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
ends on line 24 section two of the bill
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
is line 25. so
 
05:10:39.110 --> 05:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
um that is this section that you're
 
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
replacing and so the shall colon
 
05:10:46.490 --> 05:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
um is a problem still because the one
 
05:10:49.010 --> 05:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
two and three were removed from this but
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
also it seems like there is
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
um a duplication of a statement that
 
05:10:59.810 --> 05:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
that uh in on lines four you're no
 
05:11:02.330 --> 05:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
longer Crossing out the the
 
05:11:02.340 --> 05:11:02.990 align:start position:0%
longer Crossing out the the
um

05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:05.448 --> 05:11:05.458 align:start position:0%
that the public notice shall be placed
 
05:11:07.250 --> 05:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper and then on line seven
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're restating that statement so
 
05:11:13.010 --> 05:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is what is the
 
05:11:15.470 --> 05:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
importance of restating
 
05:11:17.628 --> 05:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
um the statement that it shall be placed
 
05:11:21.410 --> 05:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper twice in in on in the
 
05:11:21.420 --> 05:11:22.910 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper twice in in on in the
RSA

05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:11:22.920 --> 05:11:24.610 align:start position:0%
RSA
but

05:11:24.610 --> 05:11:24.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:26.810 --> 05:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative renzulu representative
 
05:11:28.430 --> 05:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
yokella I'm going to make a suggestion
 
05:11:31.010 --> 05:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes um there is
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
at least with some of us some confusion
 
05:11:36.650 --> 05:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
to what's actually in here
 
05:11:36.660 --> 05:11:37.970 align:start position:0%
to what's actually in here
um

05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:40.128 --> 05:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
in my opinion should have been prepared
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
in its full
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
full amount instead of amending pieces
 
05:11:49.550 --> 05:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
of this it should have come from a full
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to suggest so we can
 
05:11:53.690 --> 05:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
hear the other individuals who would
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
like to testify
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
after this hearing
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
you create an amendment prior to the
 
05:12:06.730 --> 05:12:06.740 align:start position:0%
exact session
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
that spells this out as you intended
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
before you leave I would make have one
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
question and suggestion from myself
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
or not including a day's notice in the
 
05:12:28.010 --> 05:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
day of the public hearing would it not
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
be simpler just to increase the five
 
05:12:31.910 --> 05:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
days to seven
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
that second that paragraph to me is very
 
05:12:35.458 --> 05:12:36.708 align:start position:0%
that second that paragraph to me is very
confusing

05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
05:12:39.288 --> 05:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
and leaves it open to
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of interpretation so I'm
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
going to leave you with that and asks um
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the committee give no
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
more questions please so we can get up
 
05:12:52.610 --> 05:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
our next individuals thank you I I agree
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
we'll do it thank you and I'm not I'm
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
not gonna well I'm you will hear my
 
05:13:03.890 --> 05:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
yelling all the way up here thank you
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to call uh
 
05:13:26.208 --> 05:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.218 --> 05:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.530 --> 05:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you to the
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
committee for taking the time to hear me
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
on uh HB 184. my name is Brendan McQuaid
 
05:13:47.690 --> 05:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm the president and publisher of the
 
05:13:49.970 --> 05:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire union leader I am here as
 
05:13:51.530 --> 05:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
the president of the New Hampshire press
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
Association we represent over 50
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
entities throughout the state from
 
05:13:56.280 --> 05:13:56.930 align:start position:0%
entities throughout the state from
um

05:13:56.930 --> 05:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
small online operations to weekly daily
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
newspapers to broadcasters
 
05:14:04.560 --> 05:14:05.570 align:start position:0%
newspapers to broadcasters
um

05:14:05.570 --> 05:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
a major issue with this bill
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
is the insinuation that posting to a
 
05:14:14.690 --> 05:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
public website is notice
 
05:14:17.810 --> 05:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
that's access that's not notice notice
 
05:14:20.510 --> 05:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
is that someone is told what's going on
 
05:14:23.810 --> 05:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
and what's clear in this bill is
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
it keeps the part where a Butters
 
05:14:28.850 --> 05:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
receive notice by mail
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
but it removes the part where anyone
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
else who might have an interest in
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
something that the zoning board is doing
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
is going to receive notice because they
 
05:14:39.530 --> 05:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
have to know to go to this presumably
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
town website that they may visit once a
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
year or never especially in towns where
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
there's not internet access for a lot of
 
05:14:47.700 --> 05:14:48.830 align:start position:0%
there's not internet access for a lot of
people

05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:14:52.490 --> 05:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
so it's insufficient it's not notice in
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.810 --> 05:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
our readers and readers throughout the
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
state of newspapers are reading the
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
newspaper anyway they're reading the
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
newspaper for other things they're
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
reading for local sports local news all
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff they're going to see
 
05:15:12.050 --> 05:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
the notice that's in the paper more than
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
they would see the notice that is on a
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
town website with just a you know
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps small link on the front page
 
05:15:20.690 --> 05:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
um if you ask any
 
05:15:23.448 --> 05:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
publisher or editor when a typo gets
 
05:15:23.458 --> 05:15:24.230 align:start position:0%
publisher or editor when a typo gets
through

05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
we hear about it because our readers who
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
are very civically engaged readers read
 
05:15:31.610 --> 05:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
every single thing in the newspaper and
 
05:15:35.570 --> 05:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
that is notice this bill is not notice
 
05:15:37.490 --> 05:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
um an important factor the newspapers
 
05:15:40.010 --> 05:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
perform now is they keep a third party
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
record which is distinct from the record
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
that is produced by the
 
05:15:47.330 --> 05:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
publication on a website there's no
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill to keep a record
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
that notice was given posted when it was
 
05:15:53.570 --> 05:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
posted screenshots anything like that
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
that is all done currently by the
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
newspapers back issues are available and
 
05:16:02.208 --> 05:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
most newspapers are putting that on the
 
05:16:04.610 --> 05:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
web if you look at mypublicnotices.com
 
05:16:06.890 --> 05:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's where we and a number of other
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
newspapers publish all of the Public
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
Notices that we create and they're
 
05:16:12.530 --> 05:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
available to everyone no paywall
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
so that function is in there currently
 
05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
small newspapers obviously are seeing
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
economic demographic Social Challenges I
 
05:16:26.448 --> 05:16:26.458 align:start position:0%
would urge this committee not to take
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
away a crucial role that they're
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
performing well and that is a crucial
 
05:16:33.170 --> 05:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
function for government
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
public participation has to be
 
05:16:38.208 --> 05:16:38.218 align:start position:0%
encouraged and public notice is a very
 
05:16:40.128 --> 05:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
important part of that and this bill
 
05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
clearly fails on that test
 
05:16:45.250 --> 05:16:45.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire press Association
 
05:16:48.110 --> 05:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
feels that public participation is so
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
important again access is not notice and
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we encourage you to find this bill in
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
05:16:56.638 --> 05:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Elward
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
um would you consider a weekly Shopper
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
type publication uh full of local
 
05:17:13.610 --> 05:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
advertisements and what not to be a
 
05:17:15.410 --> 05:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
newspaper in
 
05:17:15.420 --> 05:17:16.610 align:start position:0%
newspaper in
General

05:17:16.610 --> 05:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
General
 
05:17:19.250 --> 05:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
very specifically in general circulation
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah according to the current law I
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
think you would have a hard time finding
 
05:17:27.890 --> 05:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
a true Shopper anymore most weekly
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
newspapers in the state are newspapers
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.850 --> 05:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman uh follow-up are
 
05:17:40.128 --> 05:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
you saying that the difference between a
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
newspaper and a shopper could hinge on
 
05:17:42.958 --> 05:17:44.750 align:start position:0%
newspaper and a shopper could hinge on
content

05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
content
 
05:17:50.570 --> 05:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.580 --> 05:17:53.570 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:17:53.570 --> 05:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:56.208 --> 05:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
who are we going with two down there wow
 
05:17:57.170 --> 05:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll start with
 
05:17:59.090 --> 05:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative gilmanson
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:18:05.760 --> 05:18:06.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

05:18:06.770 --> 05:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:06.780 --> 05:18:08.030 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

05:18:08.030 --> 05:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
there is not a paper
 
05:18:13.610 --> 05:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
around where I live that publishes a
 
05:18:16.910 --> 05:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
paper copy that would satisfy this
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
notice requirement
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
even you know cutting it down to the
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
five days that's why I understand not
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
counting those two days on either end
 
05:18:28.250 --> 05:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
because you might see a paper within
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
five days as opposed to last week
 
05:18:34.010 --> 05:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
do you consider the online version of a
 
05:18:34.020 --> 05:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
do you consider the online version of a
newspaper

05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
which is also of
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
choice you know not a
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's not right in front of you and your
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
description of what it notices would you
 
05:18:48.410 --> 05:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
consider that the same as publishing in
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
a written newspaper of General
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
publication uh I would consider it
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
similar because those readers are going
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh to be reading that content for a
 
05:19:01.010 --> 05:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
reason other than strictly going to look
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
for that notice but may I ask where you
 
05:19:05.868 --> 05:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
live Exeter yeah
 
05:19:08.448 --> 05:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
we publish daily in Exeter I can only
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
speak for the union leader but we

05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a two-part question you
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about the distinction
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
between notice and um
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and access
 
05:19:38.448 --> 05:19:38.458 align:start position:0%
um in my local town we
 
05:19:42.288 --> 05:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
um you can subscribe to the like the
 
05:19:43.730 --> 05:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
town's website and they will actually
 
05:19:46.970 --> 05:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
email you the notice
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
um of all of the Public Notices that
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing they're not just posting
 
05:19:52.368 --> 05:19:52.378 align:start position:0%
it on the website I'm wondering if you
 
05:19:54.890 --> 05:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
would consider that notice and
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um based on your definition that you
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
stated before and is such a subscription
 
05:20:05.448 --> 05:20:05.458 align:start position:0%
model to the notice also
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
um available on that uh the one that
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
you've got you have created that website
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
where it gets pushed out to people and
 
05:20:14.690 --> 05:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
not that they have to go and look at it
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
um that one no uh there are options out
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
there for that that uh I don't know if
 
05:20:21.730 --> 05:20:21.740 align:start position:0%
any of the papers in the state do now
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
but I would not necessarily consider
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the same level notice because again
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
someone actively went and sought that
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
out and this bill doesn't currently
 
05:20:31.920 --> 05:20:33.350 align:start position:0%
out and this bill doesn't currently
require

05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
that level of commitment for the town to
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to send those out via a dedicated
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
mailing list that's a wonderful service
 
05:20:43.010 --> 05:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's being offered but that's not what
 
05:20:45.050 --> 05:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
this bill currently requires and I would
 
05:20:48.050 --> 05:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
point to a similar bill that passed in
 
05:20:48.060 --> 05:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
point to a similar bill that passed in
Florida

05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
um recently that bill required that if
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
someone signed up that they could be
 
05:20:58.128 --> 05:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
mailed in the U.S mail copies of all the
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
notices that were done which would allow
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
for people that don't have internet
 
05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
access or don't have computer access to
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester thank you Mr
 
05:21:13.490 --> 05:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:21:13.500 --> 05:21:14.090 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
um

05:21:14.090 --> 05:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
if a community does not have a daily
 
05:21:21.288 --> 05:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
newspaper the five-day notice
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
would it be included in the previous
 
05:21:25.970 --> 05:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
week or
 
05:21:28.010 --> 05:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
we get the news
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
of on
 
05:21:32.208 --> 05:21:32.218 align:start position:0%
Saturday mailed to us
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
but the news was published two weeks ago
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
in Union Leader or some other newspaper
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that's the news we get in a so-called
 
05:21:46.970 --> 05:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
the newspaper so how do you uh
 
05:21:49.010 --> 05:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
account to that that kind of community
 
05:21:52.190 --> 05:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so the I'm trying to parse what
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and I'm guessing
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
you might get uh what's in the news
 
05:21:59.330 --> 05:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
business is considered a TMC product uh
 
05:22:01.010 --> 05:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
which is a free product that gets mailed
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
to homes that's a weekly product and we
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
do not run legal notices in that our
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
legal notices are run in the daily paper
 
05:22:12.770 --> 05:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:12.780 --> 05:22:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:22:27.650 --> 05:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
community of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
all counties
 
05:22:31.490 --> 05:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't have that off the top of my
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
head I can sort of name them off the top
 
05:22:35.810 --> 05:22:35.820 align:start position:0%

five or six days a week but we continue
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
to publish that and the union leader
 
05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
again I can only speak for the union
 
05:22:53.820 --> 05:22:55.490 align:start position:0%
again I can only speak for the union
leader

05:22:55.490 --> 05:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
leader
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
we are Statewide
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you may follow up if you have
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
a question that pertains to the bill
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
that last question really didn't pertain
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I was basically trying to
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
see whether or not the people that of a
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
certain demographic do not
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
um whether they have the ability in the
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
state to get a daily paper in their
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
account okay if you have your follow-up
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead well that was the question
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
basically if everyone in the state and
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
all the counties have the ability to
 
05:23:27.350 --> 05:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
view a daily paper that would have these
 
05:23:29.690 --> 05:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
notices in them they do and and I
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee even if they don't get the
 
05:23:34.010 --> 05:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
paper their grandmother will tell them
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay it's true though what questions
 
05:23:40.610 --> 05:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
think oh
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and H Grace for the
 
05:23:55.490 --> 05:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
um we support the bill
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
um obviously it needs some work
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and we're happy to assist the extent
 
05:24:03.170 --> 05:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
we can on that
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't really have much to say other
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
than that except I just want to point
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
out to the committee because I know you
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't receive these bills that uh
 
05:24:13.010 --> 05:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
Municipal notices are subject to the
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
right to no law and there are certain
 
05:24:16.970 --> 05:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
um regulations relating to how long
 
05:24:18.530 --> 05:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
those have to be kept
 
05:24:22.010 --> 05:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
those would be found in RSA 33 hyphen a
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
colon 3 hyphen a so
 
05:24:26.930 --> 05:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
um if anyone has any questions about
 
05:24:29.390 --> 05:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
those happy to answer that
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
I have one question for you yes
 
05:24:31.980 --> 05:24:33.948 align:start position:0%
I have one question for you yes
um

05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:38.090 --> 05:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
the notification process uh the previous
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
individual given the testimony mentioned
 
05:24:43.810 --> 05:24:43.820 align:start position:0%
they also put these on notification
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
electronic memes also in their pages is
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
would you consider that the Fulfillment
 
05:24:52.250 --> 05:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
of the notification requirement
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the physical paper
 
05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question and I don't
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
have a good answer for it because there
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
is a definition for the term newspaper
 
05:25:06.288 --> 05:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
under chapter 21 I believe it is 20 or
 
05:25:06.298 --> 05:25:07.850 align:start position:0%
under chapter 21 I believe it is 20 or
21

05:25:07.850 --> 05:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
21
 
05:25:09.890 --> 05:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the implication is it
 
05:25:12.170 --> 05:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
has to be printed a newspaper is a
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
printed material not it doesn't I don't
 
05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
believe it encompasses online
 
05:25:19.930 --> 05:25:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.730 --> 05:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative majbooty
 
05:25:25.208 --> 05:25:25.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:35.868 --> 05:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
on line 16 the bill says 16 to 19 in
 
05:25:38.090 --> 05:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
lieu of publication
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
in a paper
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and you can publish it online on website
 
05:25:47.690 --> 05:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
do you believe that every Community
 
05:25:51.170 --> 05:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
every municipality has that capability
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
to publish things on their website and
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
that broadband and um
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
is available
 
05:26:03.230 --> 05:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
no and that's why it's a local option so
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
what we would encourage municious about
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
is to do is to do whatever is going to
 
05:26:10.490 --> 05:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
going to get the word out best to their
 
05:26:10.500 --> 05:26:11.570 align:start position:0%
going to get the word out best to their
community

05:26:11.570 --> 05:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:26:13.550 --> 05:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
so in some communities like Fremont
 
05:26:16.030 --> 05:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
where you can subscribe to the local
 
05:26:19.550 --> 05:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
notices from your town they're going to
 
05:26:21.288 --> 05:26:21.298 align:start position:0%
have a pretty big subscriber base I
 
05:26:23.090 --> 05:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
assume because it's a small community
 
05:26:24.410 --> 05:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be very interested
 
05:26:25.490 --> 05:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
in what's happening in their community
 
05:26:28.010 --> 05:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
so that's going to touch upon a lot of
 
05:26:32.330 --> 05:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
people there in other communities
 
05:26:32.340 --> 05:26:33.530 align:start position:0%
people there in other communities
um

05:26:33.530 --> 05:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
I can't think of one off the top of my
 
05:26:39.650 --> 05:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
head but a small rural community like
 
05:26:42.770 --> 05:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
maybe Danville isn't necessarily going
 
05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of website built out
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
um so for them they might have more
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
printed news that's available and it
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
would be a better option to to use the
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:02.448 --> 05:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for Testimony seeing no more
 
05:27:04.010 --> 05:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mitch thank you
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh last pin code we have
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
for this is Bruce I cannot
 
05:27:14.090 --> 05:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.770 --> 05:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee's Bruce
 
05:27:33.708 --> 05:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:36.890 --> 05:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
as representative renzullo it indicated
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
I had approached him to uh help modify
 
05:27:43.070 --> 05:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
the particular
 
05:27:47.150 --> 05:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
to give you some history legislature
 
05:27:53.150 --> 05:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
approved a similar amendment in 2020
 
05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
that was RSA 675 colon six six
 
05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
and that was the same requirement that
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
planning boards
 
05:28:03.170 --> 05:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
had to do
 
05:28:05.690 --> 05:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
they did this very same we basically
 
05:28:08.090 --> 05:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
replicated what that amendment was in
 
05:28:08.100 --> 05:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
replicated what that amendment was in
2020.

05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:14.810 --> 05:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
thus I'm obviously in favor of this
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
proposal as well as the amendment for
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
clarification that Amendment
 
05:28:24.050 --> 05:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually would be from line 11
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
through 19 on the original
 
05:28:27.718 --> 05:28:29.930 align:start position:0%
through 19 on the original
draft

05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
draft
 
05:28:31.850 --> 05:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
so if you take that out
 
05:28:34.010 --> 05:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
and insert the amendment it clarifies
 
05:28:36.530 --> 05:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
what the amendment was going to do
 
05:28:40.010 --> 05:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
it had been a typo and had struck a
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that we didn't want to so we
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
eliminated and kept that the newspaper
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
notice would be required if you don't
 
05:28:50.930 --> 05:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
have the internet capabilities
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you choose to do the internet
 
05:28:53.040 --> 05:28:54.530 align:start position:0%
if you choose to do the internet
capability

05:28:54.530 --> 05:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
capability
 
05:28:56.448 --> 05:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
then you don't have to do the required
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.150 --> 05:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
so basically this proposed amendment to
 
05:29:10.490 --> 05:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
RSA 676 colon 7 I Roman numeral I would
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
relieve the Zoning Board of adjustment
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
from the requirement posting the hearing
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
notice in a newspaper of General
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
circulation in the area if certain other
 
05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
stipulations are satisfied
 
05:29:23.390 --> 05:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
and that's the conditions within the
 
05:29:25.970 --> 05:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
Internet Posting
 
05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
we all know the increasing scarcity of
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
local newspapers in print in the last
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
several years
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
this has forced the zba to find the next
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
level up of local newspapers
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically it defaulted to a Statewide
 
05:29:39.600 --> 05:29:41.150 align:start position:0%
basically it defaulted to a Statewide
publication

05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
publication
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
this became more expensive to the
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
applicant as well as to the town staff
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
in preparing the required notice within
 
05:29:49.970 --> 05:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
the time frames of deadlines for
 
05:29:52.430 --> 05:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
publication that tricky once that
 
05:29:54.650 --> 05:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
five-day notice not counting the hearing
 
05:29:56.750 --> 05:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the day of the publication
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
because of the newspapers schedules and
 
05:29:58.798 --> 05:30:01.070 align:start position:0%
because of the newspapers schedules and
publications

05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
publications
 
05:30:02.930 --> 05:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
those expenses are to be paid in advance
 
05:30:05.448 --> 05:30:05.458 align:start position:0%
by the applicant of which tends to be
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
costlier with Statewide Publications
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment of eliminating
 
05:30:12.350 --> 05:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
required newspaper notice would actually
 
05:30:15.050 --> 05:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
be a cost savings to the applicant the
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the newspaper
 
05:30:19.128 --> 05:30:19.138 align:start position:0%
notice requirement enjoys the economies
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
of scale
 
05:30:23.930 --> 05:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
situation when we had five cases the
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
cost per case is less because of the the
 
05:30:31.010 --> 05:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
typeset the borders for Town gets uh
 
05:30:34.010 --> 05:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
prorated across five versus one case
 
05:30:36.910 --> 05:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
in our town we had to
 
05:30:40.368 --> 05:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
re-calculate our application fees
 
05:30:42.890 --> 05:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
we use an average three hearings
 
05:30:45.170 --> 05:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
we've derived the cost of 72 dollars
 
05:30:47.208 --> 05:30:47.218 align:start position:0%
directly to the applicant as part of the
 
05:30:49.368 --> 05:30:49.378 align:start position:0%
application advertising fee we had to
 
05:30:50.930 --> 05:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
charge the applicant
 
05:30:52.850 --> 05:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment of eliminating
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
the required newspaper notice would also
 
05:30:56.990 --> 05:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
be a cost and Time Savings to the
 
05:30:57.000 --> 05:30:58.368 align:start position:0%
be a cost and Time Savings to the
municipality

05:30:58.368 --> 05:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
this eliminates the process of writing
 
05:31:02.110 --> 05:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
the draft notice for the newspaper
 
05:31:04.910 --> 05:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
receiving the proof and then authorizing
 
05:31:06.350 --> 05:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
for publication
 
05:31:08.208 --> 05:31:08.218 align:start position:0%
as well as being mindful of the required
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
deadlines to meet the not less than five
 
05:31:13.490 --> 05:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
days prior to the date of the hearing
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
this would also eliminate writing
 
05:31:17.150 --> 05:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
purchase orders and processing invoices
 
05:31:19.010 --> 05:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
between the municipality and the
 
05:31:19.020 --> 05:31:20.390 align:start position:0%
between the municipality and the
newspaper

05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
05:31:22.490 --> 05:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
we currently use the town's website to
 
05:31:25.490 --> 05:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
publish upcoming CBA meetings and
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearings on the town's website calendar
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the cba's page
 
05:31:33.288 --> 05:31:33.298 align:start position:0%
we also provide a direct link to the
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
application the plans the staff report
 
05:31:39.050 --> 05:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's known as the e-packet
 
05:31:42.050 --> 05:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's sent via the United States Postal
 
05:31:43.970 --> 05:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
Service to those EBA members for their
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
hard copy
 
05:31:48.050 --> 05:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
and it's also available to public read
 
05:31:49.788 --> 05:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
on the internet
 
05:31:52.368 --> 05:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
my conclusion for you this proposed
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendment does save the applicants and
 
05:31:57.050 --> 05:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
the municipality time and expenses
 
05:31:59.448 --> 05:31:59.458 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions thank you for a
 
05:32:03.410 --> 05:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.410 --> 05:32:06.420 align:start position:0%

and we are down to our last hearing uh
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:39.530 --> 05:32:39.540 align:start position:0%

this bill is uh provides is relative to
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
the proration of property tax exemptions
 
05:33:26.090 --> 05:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
and provides that if an individual is
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for property tax exemption for
 
05:33:31.128 --> 05:33:31.138 align:start position:0%

05:33:36.770 --> 05:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
fractional interest in property the

exemption amount shall be prorated based
 
05:33:40.368 --> 05:33:40.378 align:start position:0%

05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
interest in the property
 
05:33:45.250 --> 05:33:45.260 align:start position:0%
and first I'll address the amendment
 
05:33:48.890 --> 05:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
all the amendment does is add on to the
 
05:33:54.050 --> 05:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
original bill as introduced to
 
05:33:57.170 --> 05:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
be sure and and put into statute that
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
the other rsas that are mentioned in the
 
05:34:03.170 --> 05:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
document do not have to be revoted by or
 
05:34:10.250 --> 05:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:12.410 --> 05:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing the Bill thank
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
05:34:17.690 --> 05:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
since you're not the sponsor or
 
05:34:19.730 --> 05:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
involved with it I want to assume that
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.550 --> 05:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.610 --> 05:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
go ahead make sure your mic's on though
 
05:35:16.970 --> 05:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:19.010 --> 05:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
is that better that's better
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jim micho I'm the chief
 
05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
assessor for the town of Hudson and I
 
05:35:24.050 --> 05:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:35:26.690 --> 05:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of House Bill 197 today
 
05:35:29.090 --> 05:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
I first want to also thank the sponsor
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors representative Maggiore
 
05:35:32.448 --> 05:35:32.458 align:start position:0%
and representative ulery
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
so uh as an assessor we administer
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
exemptions credits and property taxes
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
within our administration of the of the
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
property tax and currently if someone
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
owns a fractional interest in real
 
05:35:45.530 --> 05:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
estate and they have an elderly
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
exemption they're only receiving 50 of
 
05:35:49.010 --> 05:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
that exemption
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
but that RSA 72 colon 41 does not
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
reference that the citations for
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
disabled deaf or blind so if I'm
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
disabled in a community and I only have
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
a fractional interest I'm actually
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
receiving the entire amount of the
 
05:36:03.958 --> 05:36:04.970 align:start position:0%
receiving the entire amount of the
exemption

05:36:04.970 --> 05:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
so this proposal is to basically restore
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
Equity or make it so that regardless of
 
05:36:11.570 --> 05:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
the exemption that you have you will
 
05:36:13.128 --> 05:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
only get the amount of the exemption
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is in proportion to your fractional
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
interest the prototypical fractional
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
interest would be in a deed and it says
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
I own 50 percent
 
05:36:24.410 --> 05:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
and another person owns 50 I live there
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm elderly I get the 50
 
05:36:30.288 --> 05:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
um if you take that back pattern apply
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
it to disabled that person now is
 
05:36:34.250 --> 05:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
getting 100 of that exemption and that's
 
05:36:37.010 --> 05:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
usually not done in any in any laws
 
05:36:39.530 --> 05:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
um also for veterans credits that's
 
05:36:41.810 --> 05:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
already in in the law that if I have a
 
05:36:43.490 --> 05:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
50 interest I'm only getting fifty
 
05:36:45.708 --> 05:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
percent of my veterans credit so this
 
05:36:48.170 --> 05:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
just seeks to uh treat people in a
 
05:36:50.930 --> 05:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
similar manner based upon their interest
 
05:36:52.250 --> 05:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
um the other fractional interest that
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
you would run into is tenants in common
 
05:36:56.690 --> 05:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
so tenants in common if there's two
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
people on the property and they own it
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
as tenants in common that's
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
automatically 50 a piece
 
05:37:04.550 --> 05:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so those are the two types of
 
05:37:05.930 --> 05:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
fractional interests so we talk about
 
05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the deed first of all
 
05:37:10.430 --> 05:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
it either says 50 percent
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
30 percent whatever the percentage is
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's not many of these so in Hudson
 
05:37:18.050 --> 05:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
um I think I have one elderly exemption
 
05:37:20.448 --> 05:37:20.458 align:start position:0%
with a fractional I have maybe nine
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
veterans credits with a fractional we
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
used to have it disabled with a
 
05:37:26.570 --> 05:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
fractional they pointed out they get 100
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the exemption they were correct so
 
05:37:30.050 --> 05:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to
 
05:37:32.510 --> 05:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess fix an oversight maybe within
 
05:37:33.770 --> 05:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
05:37:35.448 --> 05:37:35.458 align:start position:0%
that is the expense extent of my
 
05:37:35.458 --> 05:37:37.430 align:start position:0%
that is the expense extent of my
testimony

05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:37:39.170 --> 05:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:37:39.180 --> 05:37:40.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:37:42.670 --> 05:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative 211.
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
once again thank you Mr chair and it's
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again thanks for coming
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
in I have a question about
 
05:37:53.810 --> 05:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
I understand that uh
 
05:37:57.288 --> 05:37:57.298 align:start position:0%
a widow of a veteran receives
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
the veterans exemption
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
in town until she or he excuse me at
 
05:38:07.128 --> 05:38:07.138 align:start position:0%
which time remarries is that correct
 
05:38:09.050 --> 05:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's correct they receive a veterans
 
05:38:12.470 --> 05:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
credit gotcha veterans credit
 
05:38:12.480 --> 05:38:13.850 align:start position:0%
credit gotcha veterans credit
um

05:38:13.850 --> 05:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
should that person not marry their
 
05:38:20.330 --> 05:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
partner whomever that might be yet they
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
live together and they have a deed in
 
05:38:26.690 --> 05:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
both their names would this fractional
 
05:38:30.410 --> 05:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
um interest apply to the amount of
 
05:38:32.330 --> 05:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
credit they would receive thank you for
 
05:38:35.330 --> 05:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
the question uh so if they hold their
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
property as joint tenants with rights of
 
05:38:39.890 --> 05:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
survivorship yes that is non-severable
 
05:38:42.050 --> 05:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
for purposes of the exemptions and
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
credit statutes so they would you're
 
05:38:44.280 --> 05:38:48.850 align:start position:0%
credit statutes so they would you're
welcome

05:38:48.850 --> 05:38:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
seeing no more hands raised thank you
 
05:38:55.550 --> 05:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
last pink card of the day Catherine heck
 
05:39:04.850 --> 05:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members the
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
last pink card of the day very exciting
 
05:39:10.670 --> 05:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be extremely brief and let
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
you know that the New Hampshire
 
05:39:13.550 --> 05:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association supports this
 
05:39:15.890 --> 05:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislation it's just trying to seek to
 
05:39:17.868 --> 05:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
correct the issue of exemptions and
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
credits being fair and Equitable as you
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony yesterday with 643
 
05:39:27.050 --> 05:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
000 households and 67 000 exemptions and
 
05:39:30.170 --> 05:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
credits granted in the state in 2021 or
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent we just want that to be
 
05:39:35.570 --> 05:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable throughout the law so
 
05:39:37.970 --> 05:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
that will conclude my testimony and I'll
 
05:39:40.190 --> 05:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
try to keep it under 30 seconds thank
 
05:39:40.200 --> 05:39:42.050 align:start position:0%
try to keep it under 30 seconds thank
you

05:39:42.050 --> 05:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
very good
 
05:39:45.890 --> 05:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
05:39:48.110 --> 05:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck
 
05:39:49.490 --> 05:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for your
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that we have a blue
 
05:39:54.830 --> 05:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
sign-in sheet with no names on it I'll
